Napa Auto Parts is a dealer of Automobiles automotive parts, selling everything from windshield wipers to front axles. They also sell snow chains, which is important if you plan on heading on a snow sports winter adventure.

Many of the mechanics in Davis purchase from them, so youd be wise to cut out the middle man and buy auto parts there yourself. Youll save lots of money by avoiding mechanics exorbitant mark up fees. This technique is particularly useful for mechanics on Richards Blvd. & Olive Drive who are within walking distance.

For some replacement parts, e.g., axles, theyll make you leave a deposit (a core charge). That way old parts get recycled. In order to get your deposit back, make sure to bring (a) the receipt, (b)  the old part, and (c) the replacement parts box.

NAPA Auto Parts Davis is now under new ownership since January 1^st^ 2007, with new hours, new staff and double the inventory.  The new owner, Neil Beadle, has another store, NAPA Auto Parts Georgetown in beautiful Georgetown, CA, in the Sierra Nevada foothills between Auburn and Placerville.  They have a  http://www.rubiconautoparts.com website where you can view more information.

They offer a AAA Discount.  Formerly this spot held CalDavis Auto & Truck Parts.



If you need to buy a new car battery, Napa is ideal. For free, they will test your old battery and check your alternator and starter.

Often times mechanics have accounts with auto parts stores which would make the parts cheaper to buy through the mechanic. I cant speak for every mechanic, but I know at least some dont make money on their parts.  Usually when a mechanics parts are really expensive, it is because the mechanic needs an uncommon, model specific part.  The problem is that he has no incentive to find cheap parts for you.  Usually you end up paying top dollar for the next or same day shipping from the closest warehouse because that was the extend of the mechanics search for a price. Alex


Napa hooked me up with some heat resistant tubing and some twist ties, and they are always friendly. My hick neighboor swears to the quality of napa parts, and rebuilt his late 80s F150 from napa parts. Users/StevenDaubert


20080115 17:35:53 nbsp For auto parts in Davis, Napa is much better than Kragen.  Napa is usually cheaper, their employees are much more knowledgeable and they can get parts that they dont have in stock quicker than Kragen.  The only downside is that they close at 6 while Kragen stays  open till 8 or 9 (I forget).  You also save 7% using your AAA card.  Users/ScottStanley

20080130 20:15:43 nbsp If you need coolant, go to Ace Hardware. About $3 cheaper there.  Users/MattCool

20080523 11:09:02 nbsp Napa has much more knowledgeable staff employed than kragen. Its a much better store all around. The only downside is that theyre more expensive for the most part. However, the parts they sell are of a higher grade than kragen. so choose your own poison. i guess. Higher pricesbetter products or low pricecheap products Users/boked

20080603 20:40:23 nbsp My experience has been the complete opposite of that mentioned below.  I normally shop at Kragen, and have been very happy with the one here in Davis (very friendly and helpful staff), but I shopped at Napa several times for parts for the plugin hybrid team I work with on campus.  Napa has an excellent location (easy, short bike from campus), but Ive found the staff to be more or less useless when asking about certain parts, and just generally not helpful.  I have not yet had a good experience with them after at least three trips, so Ive given up.  The store is also poorly stocked and poorly maintained (compared to the excellent selection and general cleanliness of the Kragen store).  I recommend Kragen. Users/Matt.Brunner

20091010 10:48:26 nbsp My experience is very terrible with this NAPA auto store. My suggestion dont go to this store if you have any other choice.
Here is my story. I was in the middle of repairing my car. I was stuck with one bolts and need to buy some deep sockets.
I went to the store and bought one socket. I came back home and found the size does not fit my car.
I went back immediately and want an exchange or return. They dont accept any tool return even it is brand new unopened.
What the hell? Thats the most terrible customer service I have ever met.
I ended buying two more deep sockets just in case since my car is not working and other store is too far for me...
Besides, their staffs dont have too much knowledge about car.
They dont care about you and do not want bother to help you.
Compared to this, I have much much better experience in Kragen and even ACE.
I will never bother to go to this store again, NEVER!!! Users/woshiss

20091016 16:43:40 nbsp My alternator died today and I made it to napa on the dying gasp of the battery. The great folks there were nice enough to loan some tools so I could get the alternator out and put the new one in. They even recharged my battery for free while I was installing the new alternator. Thanks NAPA! Users/ARWENNHOLD

20091130 16:50:09 nbsp I called about getting a replacement part for my car and they told me that there is no such part for the car. Um, no. Just, no. My mechanic replaced that part 5 years ago and it broke just yesterday, so my car DEFINITELY has that part and is inoperable without it. Theyre not really knowledgeable or willing to look up information if its not in their faulty database.  Users/DanaMace

20100210 11:50:36 nbsp compared to kragen, napa auto parts is simply the pits.
they can get more of the super specialty parts than kragen can, but they also are staffed by complete jerks.  in general my experience with napa is going in there, waiting in line for ever, then having to basically convince the employee behind the counter that he wants to sell me whatever part.
the employees (rusty in particular) seem to think that they are far superior than their customers in every way and thus have no need to even give them the time of day.  that said, the manager is a great guy... it is just his entire staff of disgruntled middle aged men who care about nothing other than their elitist mannerisms and take it out on everyone around.
at kragen there is a jovial atmosphere where employees are glad to help out in any way they can, whether that means helping you replace a light or battery, or just a friendly smile and looking up a part for you.
at Napa all this is far from the truth and i highly recommend never going there for anything, it could very well put a heavy damper on your otherwise fabulous day.  anything related to cars that you will likely need you can find at ace or kragen, and if not there, someone at kragen can point you in the right direction.
theres a reason napa is back in an alley by murder burger in a tiny old shop and kragen has lots of parking and is well lit, its a simple reflection of quality.  even though i do mechanics and am working on vehicles constantly, you wont find me at napa auto parts any longer.
never again. Users/bryan.pellissier

20100505 14:44:22 nbsp i dont care if someone is selling a first edition holo charizard for 5 bucks (probably actually worth a couple hundred) if it comes with attitude, ill take my patronage someplace where its appreciated! napa guy on the phone was cold. i guess he has a thing against people asking about prices of brake pads that arent listed online :( Users/arinazarian

20110902 21:15:49 nbsp they seem kind of rude and like they have no clue what you are talking about. i couldnt even call up and ask a simple question without the person on the phone asking, what? Ive gone in there before to find a part for my car and guess what? NOBODY HELPED ME. Im not saying women dont know anything about cars, but it was very clear that i had no clue what i was looking for. i needed help and its like i didnt exist there. they should work on customer service side of things. The only time i had a good experience with them was when i called in about a repair. the repair was very costly and they seemed to want to pay attention then. i did not bother getting repair work there btw.  Users/Sandlot3

20111226 20:01:57 nbsp Ive had only good experiences at this store and Ive been going there for years. Rusty and the guys are always very helpful and have been good about returns and bringing back battery cores after more time has passed than youd normally expect that. Users/m610

20120322 23:57:56 nbsp Ive been in town for decades but am new to Davis Wiki and am troubled by the fact that NAPA has a mix of good and bad reviews.  But Ill add my experience.  I needed an unusual antenna for a 1965 car.  Mark and somebody else there couldnt quickly find it or a suitable substitute after five or more minutes in their parts catalogs (both of them working on this problem at the same time) BUT kept trying and they eventually found a universal one they were confident would fit the car.  And this was not going to be a highprofit item: the final charge, after the 10% AAA discount, was under $8.  They ordered the part and it came in.  AND Mark was kind enough to pretzel himself under the dash of the car to verify that the plug from the antenna cord would fit into the jack of the stereo.  I had gotten there 3 minutes before closing, so he spent maybe 15 minutes with me past closing time on the antenna issues.  Friendly throughout, no complaints.  I returned there the next day and was served courteously.  It may pay for the consumer to be pleasant, patient, and respectful to the guys there, as I was.  And maybe the place is improving.

20121221 19:28:24 nbsp Ive been here several times for various reasons.  Ive really only dealt with Mark.  Mark is helpful, honest, and has a great attitude.  I get the impression this NAPA treats their employees really well, and if they dont, they should!  Some of the guys at Kragen/OReilly are nice and helpful too, but you can really feel the care at this NAPA.   Have not tried to borrow tools at NAPA yet, but OReilly gave me a big ole bucket of tools to change my battery with (did not have a wrench on me). Users/bartbart
