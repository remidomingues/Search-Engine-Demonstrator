Napa Valley is world famous for its wine and beautiful scenery.  Its about a 45 minute drive from Davis, either down Interstate 80 to Highway 12 or simply follow Covell Boulevard through Winters and into the mountains. This will drop you off on the north side of the valley.

Napa Valley is mostly private property, but surrounding areas provide many opportunities for wiki:napa:Hiking hiking in Napa County. Theres also a wiki:wikipedia:French Laundry, but you cant afford it and they do a lousy job pressing trousers.

If you ever find yourself in the town of Napa, a recommended stop for lunch is at the http://www.napariverinn.com/historicnapamill/napageneral.php Napa General Store and dinner at http://www.celadonnapa.com/ Celadon.  Both are located in the http://www.napariverinn.com/historicnapamill/index.php Historic Napa Mill.  Another suggestion is to try heading up to St Helena to grab wine, dinner and drinks at the Culinary Institute. The prices are reasonable (they are a non profit educational outfit) and the food is fantastic. They have an amazing wine cellar, 30 year sherrys and some of the best 40 Scotch youll have the privilege of tasting.
