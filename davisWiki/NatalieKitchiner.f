Speaking of which, I do a LOT of walking (no car bike) and general loitering around in Davis with friends. So if I look familiar, it may be because youve seen me wandering around in north davis (I live at Almondwood Almondwood Apartments, selling smoothies at Jamba Juice Jamba Juice (yay for my custom made OJ + strawberries + Burner boost), jogging along the The Green Belt Greenbelt or a la ARC ARC, ordering nachos down at The Guad The Guad or studying at various cafes like Cafe Roma Campus Roma, Chamonix Chamonix, or Peets Coffee and Tea Peets. But I mean, come on, how many curlyheaded nearsighted blaxican chics are there really in Davis? :P Say hi!
