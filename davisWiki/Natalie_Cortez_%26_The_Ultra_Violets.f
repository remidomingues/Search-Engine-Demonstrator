Steve Nicholson writes: The official title of the CD is The Freeman Sessions: Stupid Fresh or Stupid Bad?. Or something like that. One is the title and the other is the subtitle. It was a fun CD to record. We did five of the songs in two weekends at Greg Freemans Tiny Telephone studio in San Francisco. The sixth was recorded at Enharmonic Studios as part of a Kevin Seconds tribute CD. Its too bad we never got to record that fourth album, but you know how it goes with bands sometimes.
