Id recommend parking your bike in an area with lots of other bikes, preferably in the middle of a big crowd of bikes, and not having a bike that looks brand new and super fancy. Or possibly getting a second chain lock, if youre really worried about it. I used two locks for much of my time on campus, and never had my bike stolen. Users/ElleWeber
