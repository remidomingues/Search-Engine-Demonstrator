Natcar is an undergraduate design contest run by National Semiconductor and the University of California at Davis since 1994. In the past few years, the competition has been joined by other universities, including wiki:sanjose:San Jose State University, the UC Berkeley, Oklahoma State University, and California State University, Sacramento CSU Sacramento. The purpose of the contest is to provide undergraduates with a meaningful design experience with an emphasis on electronic circuits.

The objective of the competition is to design and construct an autonomous race car that can negotiate a preset course in the shortest time possible. The course is marked by 1inchwide white floor tape on a darkcolored background (carpet). In addition, there is a wire under the tape and the wire is driven with a 75 kHz sinusoidal signal (100 mA rms).
