He lived on E. Eighth Street and later in the incomparable luxuriousness of Slatters Court Residential Resort.

After a lot of screwing around, traveling, truck driving and community college, Nate finally settled back in Davis in 2004 to finish his engineering degree, which he did in June 2006.  He currently lives in Oakland and works in San Francisco as a Java developer.
