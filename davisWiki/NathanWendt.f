Welcome to the Davis Wiki.  You should check out the information page for Business owners Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner here.
I would also recommend you change the wording of the cooks collision page to be less Advertisey.  The page should be more directed at being informational for the community rather than trying to sell the business.
Take a look at some other business pages that have been around a while and you should be able to see how the wording is more informational than promotional.  It is good to include information like your mission statement or motto.
