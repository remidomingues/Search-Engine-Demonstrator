Hi there, I saw you were having trouble formatting the photo on Nathaniel Vigeant Wedding Photography, so I helped you out and put it in the upper right hand corner. The code looks like this:

{{{Image(image_name.jpg, right, thumbnail, 400)}}}

As far as I understand it, the thumbnail makes it not so huge and the 400 makes it a little bit bigger than a normal tiny thumbnail (but you can make that number anything you like, it doesnt have to be 400). You might want to check out Help with Images but dont feel bad; I use the Preview button a ton when working with photos.  Users/ElleWeber
PS. You may want to rename the file with a name that better describes what the image is, so when youre working with a bunch of different photos you know which is which.

20091020 00:53:49 nbsp Its ok, post your information wherever you think you could reasonably do business. Only a few people will see it repeatedly anyway. I love your picture of the railroad tracks! It would be nice to write something about the different venues where you have worked in the various wikis though, and link them to and from the pages about your business. Thanks!

20091026 16:02:20 nbsp Hey thanks for the friendly feedback!  I do a lot of traveling in my work, most of which is outside of our small community and Ive found this an excellent way to reach out to people.  I will try to post regional specific content to my sites, as opposed to the same template.  Jason and Nick. You guys seem pretty active on here, Id love to meet in person for coffee or drinks and find out more about the community.  Thanks!    Users/NathanielVigeant

20091026 17:16:03 nbsp Hey, anytime. I work at home so Im usually interested in getting out somewhere. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20100217 18:49:36 nbsp Putting up information about your business on http://daviswiki.org/Users/NathanielVigeant?actionuserinfo 15 different wikis really looks more like spam than contributing to the respective wikis. Users/JasonAller
