http://www.nanowrimo.org National Novel Writing Month is when folks across the world settle down in front of their laptops to write 50,000 original words in a coherent story between midnight on November 1 and the end of November 30. It was founded in 1999 by Bay Area fellow Chris Baty, who did it with 21 of his friends. In 2000 the website was born, and it really started to take off in 2001. Now its frigging huge.

Users/JenniferRutherford Jennifer Rutherford is apparently the longestrunning NaNoer in the region, having done it consistently since 2001.

The region for the http://www.nanowrimo.org/eng/node/125 Sacramento/Northern California (but not quite Bay Area) forum goes strong around here every year. During the month of November, the Davis writers hold various writeins at restaurants/coffeehouses in the downtown area. You can also head off to ones in Sacramento and other towns, should you be so inclined. Events being held in the area can be found on the forums, or at http://sacnano.org/ sacnano.org.

Davis writeins for 2009 are currently being held:
 (a) Sundays at 2 p.m. at Cloud Forest Cafe
 (b) Wednesdays at 6 p.m. at Crepeville
 (c) Fridays at 6 p.m. at 3rd and U Cafe

Look around for people sitting in a group with laptops, possibly with a NaNoWriMo sign on the table.
