National Organization for Women (NOW) is the largest organization of feminist activists in the United States. NOW has 500,000 contributing members and 550 chapters in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

NOW was founded in 1966 and its original purpose remains unchanged, to take action to bring women into full participation in the mainstream of American society now, exercising all privileges and responsibilities thereof in truly equal partnership with men. The organization remains active in lobbying legislatures and media outlets on womens issues. NOW works to eliminate discrimination and harassment in the workplace, schools, the justice system, and all other sectors of society; secure Abortion abortion, Contraception birth control and reproductive rights for all women; end all forms of Campus Violence Prevention Program violence against women; eradicate Race & Ethnicity racism, sexism and Rainbow Community homophobia; and promote equality and justice in our society.
