The National Society of Collegiate Scholars is an Honor Societies honor society that is a bit like a wiki:wikipedia:Whos Who Whos Who for college students. Membership is by invitation and is extended to aboveaverage students who are willing to pay the initiation fee. Unlike a Whos Who directory, there may actually be some benefits. They offer Scholarships scholarships and try to help students get ahead with their career choices with extensive networking.  They often have lunches scheduled with executives of prominent companies in certain fields, or alumni of the Society arrange informational opportunities and many internships.

There are many member benefits which make being a member worth it.  Whether its the $250 to $500 scholarship you receive if you Education Abroad Center study abroad, or the 5% discount to NSCS members on all products bought from Barnes and Noble.

Theres probably a lot more going on that this poster doesnt want to look up, he just wanted to get a page started and hopes an active member or leader of the Davis Chapter finds their way onto the Wiki.
