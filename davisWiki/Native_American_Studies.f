The http://nas.ucdavis.edu/ Native American Studies department office is in 2401 Hart Hall. The program was introduced in the late 1960s. UCD is one of only two schools in the country to offer a Ph.D. program in this field. Jack Forbes, a former professor, was instrumental in advancing Native American Studies as a formal educational path, not only in Davis but in terms of nationwide acceptance as well.
