Native Americans, also referred to as American Indians, are an Race & Ethnicity ethnic group composed of those with ancestry from any of the various indigenous peoples of the Americas.

Over a thousand years before Davis existed, the Native Americans who inhabited the region called themselves Patwin and spoke the RiverPatwin dialect of a Wintuan language.  As the name suggests, the RiverPatwin peoples lived on the banks of the Sacramento River and the nearby creeks.  At least one Patwin tribe, Puttoy, lived along Putah Creek (Patwin: Liwaito), and there is evidence that other tribes frequently visited the area.  By 1833, the majority of RiverPatwin had died of illness, and within the next few years, survivors typically became displaced in inhospitable lands or were forced to go to Catholic Missions.

From 2006 to 2008, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated that 1.1% of the total Davis population was Native American.
