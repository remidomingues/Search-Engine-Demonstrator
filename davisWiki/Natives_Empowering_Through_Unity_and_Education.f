NEUE is part of the Student Recruitment and Retention Center.

Natives Empowering Through Unity and Education (NEUE), formerly known as American Indians for Recruitment and Retention (AIRR), was created by the Native American Student Union (NASU) to address the needs of the UC Davis American Indian population. NEUE is dedicated to reversing low graduation, recruitment and retention rates by utilizing a holistic approach to student development.

Efforts will include cultural identity workshops, support groups, community dialogue circles, retreats, and leadership development skills. NEUE also assists in several oncampus Native events.

NEUE is located in the basement of South Hall.
