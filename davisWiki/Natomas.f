Natomas is known for its huge housing development neighborhood in North Natomas northwest of downtown Sacramento.  The area is approximately 20 minutes away from Davis (by car on Interstate 80).  The area is loosely bordered by the American River American and Sacramento River Sacramento Rivers to the west and south.  The Natomas area is a flood plain protected only by decadesold levees.  The area is particularly vunerable to annual flooding as well as severe flooding if a levee were ever to break. While South Natomas (south  e of Interstate 80) is over 30 years old, most of the growth in North Natomas has occurred in the last decade.  Among these new developments is Natomas Park, a masterplanned community opened in 1999.

Arco Arena is located in North Natomas. The Natomas Marketplace and Sacramento Gateway shopping complexes near Truxel Blvd. and the surrounding area are awesome. Tons of restaurants, lots of small stores and the nice, huge chain stores, e.g. Home Depot, Walmart, Target, Frys, etc. Some UC Davis students and faculty live in Natomas for the cheap rent.
