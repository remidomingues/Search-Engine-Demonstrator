 Store History 

Bob Black helped start Natural Food Works. The store started out in the Terminal Hotel at 206 G Street in 1971.

 Store Philosophy 

Local food bypasses shipping costs, avoiding the many layers of markup involved in conventional grocery shopping.  The idea is that food staples move directly from local farms to their store, and directly from there to your home. Some items will make a stop in their kitchen to become prepared foods, but you still eliminate a lot of middlemen. Local food is good for the environment and for sustainable food systems, and its good for your budget.

The concept is to build a new model for a local food system that works. They aim to grow the concept, providing for more grower participation and more product diversity.

20050218 17:35:23 nbsp A little on the pricey side, but you can get great quality stuff here; bioregional and organic... I heart Natural Food Works Users/JevanGray

20050830 22:55:30 nbsp Ive never eaten here but Ive been walking past it lately.  Got any suggestions? Users/IrenePark

20070129 19:11:35 nbsp This place has a lot of herbs that you probably wouldnt find anywhere else in town. I stopped by to buy some valerian root to entertain my cat, and out of curiosity I wanted to clarify something I read on the internet about its effects on humans. So, this is supposed to calm you down? And the lady who helped me responded No, this gives you psychic energy. Be on the lookout for pseudospiritual stuff, and take medicinal claims with a grain of salt. Users/KarlMogel

20071205 12:58:15 nbsp Very, Very disappointed. I had heard such good things from friends about this place. About 2 weeks ago I emailed about the possibility of ordering a glutenfree dairyfree cake for a party and never received a response. I called today to follow up and as I just started to speak I was cutoff and told I would get a call later. Even if I do happen to get a return call, I will not bring my business here.  Users/MyaBrn

20100401 16:13:18 nbsp All I can say is WOW! I was recently diagnosed with celiacs disease, so when I accidentally walked by this store this afternoon I was happily surprised to find such a place in Davis! Not only that, but the two samples of bread I was given were PHENOMENAL!! I bought a few loaves, as well as some other goodies to try  butternut squash ravioli, and a brownie. (The brownie never made it home  Ill never crave a wheat brownie again.) Thanks for making a tough diagnosis seem completely doable  with great food like this, who can go complain? Users/juliebates

20111201 12:46:57 nbsp This place is amazing and I wish we had one in San Diego. We had a fairly large group, called ahead with our order and had some of the most delicious food Ive ever had in a restaurant.Definitely the freshest food. You wont like this place if you like eating while texting, if TGIFs is your favorite restaurant, or if you care more about fast service than eating real food. Users/TillyWhitehead

20111229 21:37:53 nbsp Oh my god they have best glutenfree bread Ive ever tasted! Definitely made my day. Expensive for a loaf ($6.95), but when you have diet restrictions up the wazoo, the money is worth the deliciousness. Users/argyle
