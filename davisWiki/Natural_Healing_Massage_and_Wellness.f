20120411 23:13:40 nbsp Nanci is one of the best massage therapists I have been to. She is super strong but her approach to massage is more subtle. She has an advanced sense of pressure which, as a massage therapist myself, I know is something that is either innate or takes a very long time to learn. In Nancis case, she is obviously a natural healer (hence the business name) and being in her presence is healing in itself. She has a very diverse repertoire of techniques and modalities, and I know her clients love her to pieces. I highly recommend you check her out! Users/LilyS
