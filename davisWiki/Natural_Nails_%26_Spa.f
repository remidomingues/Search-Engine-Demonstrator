20111213 01:00:33 nbsp This place is amazing!
Went here for foot massage after a long day walking and standing at work. The massage is so great that I forgot it been an hour. Oh, this place also do nails. Will be back to try body massage and also bring my wife for her to do her nails. Users/TanTruong


20120205 17:36:21 nbsp Ive been to a few places in Davis and a couple in the bay area and this is my favorite thus far.  I dont go anywhere else now unless its when I visit my friends out of town and they want to do a spa day.  The service and staff is awesome and the prices are reasonable, highly recommend.

20120602 03:50:44 nbsp The worst massage experience I had so far. At first it seems that they are friendly, but do their best to charge you as much as they can. Some of the massues cant speak english and so just waste of time and money. She charged me for one hour but gave me 50 minutes massage. Never go to this place again.

20120705 22:31:29 nbsp I went here with two friends it was great! They offer some awesome pedicure and manicure services for very good prices, and even for the cheapest ones, they exfoliate, use a GOOD base coat and topcoat, and dont skimp on the massage time. You can customize what you want via different packages. Also, the ladies working here were very skilled; they spent much more time and effort trimming cuticles and shaping the nails than most salons do. I have tough, large cuticles, and they made them look fantastic. My manicure and pedicure also lasted longer than usual, probably due to the effort put into them and the attention to using nice products. The great service for a low price was a lovely surprise. Five stars! :)  Users/SarahBon

20121019 18:11:27 nbsp Despite the bad comments that are posted, Natural Nails & Spa is the absolute best place to go for my pedicures and manicures. They actually bother to take Care of you, make you feel welcome, and know you by name (if you are a regular!). They do quality service and its ridiculously affordable. The entire space is aesthetically very pleasing, modern and CLEAN. They take pride in the upkeep of the salon, which is refreshing to know at least for me. Every time I go there, they are genuinely happy and each and every time its a great experience and quality work. Destiny is AMAZING at gels, manicures and pedicures. So is every beautician there. If you are looking for a younger girl, who is fluently english, fun and awesome  Destiny is your girl. Tammy is one of the nicest women I have met, and she always takes time to do the best job possible. Trust me, you wont be disappointed. Go during the hours when its not busy!  Bebe is the owner and again, just like everyone else, she is so nice, does exactly what you want, and does a great job! My business always goes here. Im very happy Users/HayleyOrtman

20130407 21:22:15 nbsp DANGER!!!! I came here after reading all the awesome reviews and paid for a pedicure. The lady working on me totally sliced into the corner of my big toe as she was cutting away the dead skin. Within days, my toe was seriously infected, swollen, red, painful and oozing pus!!! What did she do to me?!? Finally, I went to the doctor and was put on antibiotics to fight the infection. Its been over 2 weeks since the appointment and my toe isnt even close to being healed. Ive read about horror stories like these, which is why I read a lot of yelp and davis wiki reviews first, but I guess it can happen to anyone :(((( Users/KikiBueller

20131105 10:38:03 nbsp I had a great mani/pedi experience here. They offer more extensive services for mani pedis than other places, and I think that their prices are great. It looked awesome afterwards, and Im picky about french pedicures being neat.   Users/SarahBon

20140422 22:44:20 nbsp I have been to several nail salons in Davis and have been a resident of Davis for 12 years . This was my first time to Natural Nails. I was referred by a friend and couldnt be happier. This is a cozy place that is extremely clean. I was a walkin without an appointment and had a gel manicure and deluxe pedicure. Amy was my technician and she was great. She took her time, made sure I was comfortable and gave an awesome hand and leg massage. I dont get gel very often but seeing Im going to Vegas I decided to splurge. My nails look amazing. The deluxe pedicure is the way to go. It includes hot towels, exfoliation, masque , leg massage, stones, and paraffin wax. The only hiccup I had is I have big feet size 14 so they didnt gave a bag that fit my feet. Their customer service was above and beyond. I was given extra time on the massage as well as wax on my hands . The best thing about this pedicure is they take their tine, give attention to detail , and the leg and got reflexology was one of the best I ever had. I had a French pedicure with design. I cant wait to have an excuse to come back here and see Amy. Awesome experience. My total came to $75 for deluxe pedicure with design and French tip and French gel manicure. Their massage chairs are very comfortable as well. Users/ElizabethBarthel

20140730 11:10:24 nbsp Helen did a great job with my pedicure + foot/leg massage.  I cant say anything bad about that.

BUT They are falsely advertising their $20 pedicure through Yelp and not honoring the coupon any longer.  They only told me that after I had gotten my pedicure and refused to give me the discount.  They also charged me an extra $1 b/c I was using a credit card.  I agree that this place is great, but they WILL try and nickel & dime you, so be careful. Users/j0liefllle
