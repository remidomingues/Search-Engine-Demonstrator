## After the elections, well switch to the following one and move it down to the bottom of the entries for historical record.  (That way if they run in the next election or hold other offices, their entry shows that they were part of the Fall 2007 election, and are crossindexed with other candidates for their historical record, but the actively running for (whatever) office slot in the upper part of the entry remains open for any future runs.
## Or at least so Ive been thinking as a method to flag active runs for people interested in browsing for who they want to vote for, and still retaining a historical record through the years.  If this works well, we can use a similar method to cross index the City Council and such, where the same people pop up in various offices over the years, and also periodically appear on ballots.
## Bold the winners names:
