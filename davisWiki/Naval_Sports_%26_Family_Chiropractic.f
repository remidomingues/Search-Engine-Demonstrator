20051206 16:22:00 nbsp Ive been to a number of chiropractors (in Davis and Sacramento), and Dr. Naval is the most professional and highest tech Ive been to.  During my initial physical (before my first session), he pointed out that Im too rough on my ears when I swab them.  Numerous general practice doctors have looked in my ears, and none bothered to mention that.  If he were a GP, hed be my family doctor!  One tip, though: if he says hes going to print out information for you, make sure he remembers to do it before you leave! Users/BillKendrick
