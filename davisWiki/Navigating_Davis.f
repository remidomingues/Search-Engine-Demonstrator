Most of Davis is fairly easy to navigate around via various means of transportation because a large portion of it was planned to follow a basic grid pattern.  However, navigating through some parts of Davis can be difficult, as streets are not clearly differentiated, signage is inadequate, and many of Davis streets have names that are completely unmemorable.  It doesnt impede navigation much, but it makes giving directions difficult.  Even then, its useful to look at a Maps map.  If you get lost downtown, you can always look at the Downtown Map Signs.

Downtown Davis is on the grid system where lettered streets run north/south and numbered streets run east/west. On north/south streets, addresses start at the last numbered street. For example, on E street, the 300 block is between 3rd street and 4th street. The same applies to most north/south streets in Central Davis Central and Downtown Davis.  Some geocoding software still have issues on this simple grid, as the block between 3rd and 4th has addresses from 300 to 350, and the next block from 400 to 450.

From some locations, on a clear day, hills are visible to the west which can be useful in navigation.

In many areas of Davis, the street names conform to different Street Name Themes themes.  Some of these themes reflect the unique social climate of the community.  For example, many streets in the Village Homes development are named after characters and places in The Hobbit.  Other streets are named after prestigious universities.  Other themes are fairly standard, such as a section of North Davis in which streets are named after different species of birds.  Some streets have talking crosswalks.

Shortcuts allow you to get from point to point in nonobvious ways.  Many cut across areas that are supposedly blocked to traffic (part of the planned growth), but are accessible to foot or bike traffic  or in some cases can be navigated with a vehicle.
