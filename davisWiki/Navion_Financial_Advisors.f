Navion Financial Advisors offers personal and Business to Business services business financial planning services.  Like most financial advisors, their services include investment advice and management, but unlike most advisors (and even most CFPs) they offer planningonly services for those who dont have a large investment portfolio.  They are proud to adhere to a fiduciary standard, unlike brokerages that use a suitibility standard.

Most or all of the planning services are available either as a onetime analysis (which will include a thorough financial plan) or on an ongoing basis through their annual retainer program.  The ongoing service involves all of the basic onetime services plus periodic monitoring, biannual retirement reviews, an annual meeting and thorough review, and so on.  They also collect and maintain your financial data, allowing you to review it all in one place through their online system, and making it easy to provide information to your tax person.

Additionally, like most CFPs, they provide insurance review and investment advisory services.
