Obviously, they specialized in army and navy supplies, but they also had other stuff.  The Army/Navy Surplus was a great place for camping supplies (like stoves and cooking gear).  Though one would have expected them to stock combat boots, they instead had a large selection of cowboy boots and even childrens boots.  There were a multitude of hats and shirts, but no uniform jackets.  Utilitieswise, they stocked pocket knives and handcuffs without the saferelease.

Dont go in a large group because I dont think they liked it.  When asked if they stock different sizes of items, they werent very friendly.  And dont throw the cool rope trap over people because youll get yelled at.
