As of 2011, the Nelson Gallery has moved from its original location in the Art Building on the UC Davis campus to its new location in Nelson Hall. The gallery has taken over the building that used to be the University Club, featuring a larger exhibit.

THE RICHARD L. NELSON GALLERY was dedicated in 1976 in memory of the first Chairperson of the Department of Art at UC Davis. Established as an exhibition venue and teaching resource for the Art Department, the gallery program also serves the campus population, art communities, and general public of Northern California and the Central Valley. A schedule of three exhibitions and the annual MFA show have an emphasis on contemporary art in support of curriculum in Art and Art History as their main focus. Special attention is paid to building ties across) disciplines within the University and to partnerships with both cultural and nonarts groups outside the University. The exhibition program is supplemented with lectures, publications and other public events. Gallery operations and programs are supported by various donors, program support grants, endowment income from the Nelson Gallery Endowment and the Vesta Endowment Fund, the Department of Art and Art History, and membership in the Nelson Artfriends, a public organization.

I think its better not to have info. about current gallery shows on this page since one click away is the official site with the same info. Why duplicate it? Why spend the time and effort to do so? Theres also greater chance of errors in a copy, and theres always the timesync problem. The DavisWiki works best for info. that changes slowly (annually) or exists nowhere else, or at least in not such a clear form. If another site has clear and useful info., let them do it.
