Nerf is a game/sport similar to Airsoft and Paintball.  Popular with children and geeks.  There is a club on campus dedicated to NERF, Davis Urban Gaming Group

It is played with air or spring powered guns that fire soft foam projectiles, including but not limited to, darts, arrows, balls, and rockets.  Because of the relatively low speed of Nerflike weapons it is a much less dangerous sport, it can even be played indoors, not to mention parks or school campuses (hint hint).  The simplicity allows for a variety of modifications to increase accuracy, and range.  It is also much less expensive than Airsoft or Paintball with decent Nerflike weapons or weapon sets costing anywhere from $6 to $40 USD.

 Game Types 

There many types of games that can be played with Nerflike guns, almost anything that can be played with Airsoft or Paintball can be adapted to Nerf.  Including but not limited to:

  Capture the Flag
  Capture and Hold
  Last Man Standing
  Manhunt or Bounty Hunters
   This is kind of a complicated type of game that Ive been wanting to play for some time.  Start out by dividing players into two groups, Hunters and Hunted, this should be an uneven division with Hunters having the majority.  The goal of each Hunter is to kill as many Hunteds as possible.  The goal of every Hunted is to survive until a preset time limit is reached.  Here is the catch, this isnt a team game, cooperation could be an advantage or a hindrance, and it is perfectly legal for a Hunter to eliminate his competition.  Ive often thought this would be fun with to play in a downtown area with a single game lasting a couple hours.
