20080404 09:51:54 nbsp I love the stuff in here but could never afford it. Its really expensive but I imagine it would be worth it if you wanted to spend alot of $$ to be nice to yourself. ) Users/MyaBrn

20080805 18:34:30 nbsp Thanks Rosalie and Lynne for spanning the globe, saving us airfare, and bringing us unique gifts and works of art. Nestware rocks! Users/onnaca

20081013 15:45:44 nbsp I absolutely love this boutique!!!  When I can splurge that is the first place I go, and even when I cant afford it I still stroll by there to say hi to Lynn and Rosalie  they are so lovely.  If you ever need a unique home decor item, stationary or even jewelry please check them out, this is one local shop I want to stick around for a long time :) Users/Cal

20081119 20:32:27 nbsp Nestware was one of just a few businesses in DTD (downtown Davis) that proudly put a no on 8 sign up in their window.  This means so much to so many of us, and in the future I definitely will have less hesitation when considering a pricey cheese tray or wall decoration.  Also, I was watching a $200 computer bag in here for months and months, waiting for it to go on sale, and when I finally was about to give up and buy a different bag I called the store and told them my plight and they sold it to me for half off... clearly, there are only positive things to say about this store (even if you cant afford anything in it)!

20090423 18:32:19 nbsp Nestware is one of the nicest places to buy gifts in Davis  I used to come in more often, when Five Figs was upstairs. (The two businesses really seemed to complement one another, and I wish they were in the same space!) The staff are incredibly friendly, and its hard to leave without feeling inspired. The Christmas trees they set up in the store at the holidays are stunning. I love their kitchenwares, and especially the ceramics by Alex Marshall. Users/calvin2

20101123 14:24:17 nbsp Nestware has lovely merchandise and wonderful treasures throughout the store. Unfortunately, each of the THREE times I went in to browse I was completely ignored. On my first visit I was the only customer and, despite the presence of two people behind the counter, neither of them said anything after their first hello (which was in response to mine). On my second visit I spent a long time looking at a fabulous dress. Again: not a single offer to help me (I couldnt see a fitting room). I cherish the small town feel of Davis, in which people connect in real ways, but was utterly put off by the indifferent vibe of Nestwares proprietors.  Users/ZoraDillon
