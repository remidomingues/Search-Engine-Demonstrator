The mission of NewStar Chinese School (NSCS) is to teach student Chinese language and culture through classroom instructions, special art, cultural events, and field trips. To accomplish the mission we rely on experienced teachers, the cooperation and involvement of parents, active participation of students and community support.

Our instruction is tailored mainly to youths who learn Chinese as a second language and is compatible with SAT IIChinese, a standardized test required for acceptance to universities. “Standard Chinese” (edited by People’s Education Press) is used as the textbook, which has a great reputation in oversea Chinese education. Classes are offered from kindergarten to eighth grade as well as a special beginners conversation Chinese class where adults as well as children can learn to speak Chinese in a relaxed atmosphere.

In addition to the language instruction, the NewStar Chinese School offers a variety of artistic and cultural classes such as dancing, singing and WuShu (Chinese martial arts) to students and community members. These classes promote a better understanding of Chinese cultural heritage, mutual respect, tolerance of diverse cultures in the society, and confidence and selfesteem in students and parents.

Together we can make NEWSTAR CHINESE SCHOOL a wonderful adventure.  May the stars shine on everyone who wishes to learn about China, about her language, culture and people!

NSCS is a registered nonprofit and can receive taxdeductible contributions from parents, individuals or organizations.  NSCS is grateful for your generous support.
