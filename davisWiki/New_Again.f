The Davis Family Mural, officially titled New Again is possibly the most unintentionally disturbing piece of Town art public art in Davis. It was created by local artists along with children from the FamiliesFirst program.  This piece is part of the City of Davis Art in Public Places program, which seeks to purchase art that enhances the quality of the Davis environment.

After looking at the mural for a bit, you begin to realize the environment the city hoped to promote: that of absolute terror.

The mural is located on the corner of 3rd Street and G Street. It adorns the original building of The Davis Enterprise. Although no longer considered to be the newspapers main facility, the Enterprise still uses the refurbished structure as a pressroom and for mail and loading purposes.
