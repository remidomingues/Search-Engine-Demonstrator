Tandoori wraps come with potato or cucumber salad can cost between $56.50. The paneer wrap has larger quantities of paneer than any other dish in town, most of which cost 23 times the price!

20060208 20:13:57 nbsp I had lunch here today with a few coworkers.  The chicken wrap was excellent!  The sweet lassi was tasty  not quite as good as the ones at Kathmandu, but still very much worthwhile.  Service was a little slow, considering the fact that the place wasnt very busy, but Ill definitely go back in the future. Users/GrahamFreeman

20060313 09:27:08 nbsp My girlfriend and I had dinner here a couple of weeks ago.  Since were huge curry fans, we ordered a couple of curry dishes and a yogurtbased appetizer.  The appetizer was very tasty, with a nice difference between the blandness of the yogurt and the spice on the item.  However, it took them an HOUR to get us our main dishes, despite the fact that the place was not all that busy.  The curry was decent but nothing to write home about  Kathmandu is markedly better.  Based on the slow service and better alternatives, I am not planning on returning. Users/AlexPomeranz

20060316 09:51:35 nbsp Hey guys whats goin on, to all my readers out there this is alex pereira, i am the owner of the restaurant, i have read and reviewed all your comments.  i am happy to hear your honesty in posting comments.  I am going to be in Davis full time starting in the end of May 2006 and i assure you all that there will be many new innovative chages to the restaurant.  Many new events such as students night with discouted prices, happy hours specials with a wide array of  different beers and wines.  All the changes will greatly better reestablish the restaurant.  I will be doing some of the cooking and will try to add in new specials and try and improve the quality in taste of the food, for all those you had a issues with what you have ordered in the past.  I know alot has changed since your initial postings and i once again reassure you it will continue to flourish. Users/AlexPereira


20060318 22:27:07 nbsp Ive eaten here twice. First time was a long time ago, before waiters took orders, when they had free chai.

I had dinner again at New Delhi Chaat Cafe tonight (March 18), and I was very dissapointed. The selection of food looks very good, but the quantity is not worth the price, and the service was horrible, I went through 4 servers!

I ordered a vegetable korma dinner, which is supposed to come with daal, rice, and naan. When it came, there was no daal. So upon asking why there was no daal, the server gave me this exact reply:

Oh yeah, the daal comes with the dinner but you have to ask for it, becuase we figure people wont eat it, and a lot of it will probably get thrown away, so we just wait for people to ask for it. We can bring it to you if you want it.,

How can a restaurant just leave out portions of meals, and make assumptions like the customer probably wont want it?

Not only that, but then my bill came and an extra dollar had been tacked on! As if they dont know how to add! I just paid my bill and left.

I am very dissapointed. Users/CaseyDeng

20060512 10:45:43 nbsp I used to love the ice tea, the making of which actually involved brewing, now Im not so sure.  In any case it was strong and tasty.  Since the day waiter changed (a month or so ago?) its been weak and strange tasting.  Refills, when you get them, come from the fridge, instead of a pitcher full of ice.  Please bring back the old ice tea, the new tea is weak, funny tasting, and sometimes tastes of soap. Users/MrIceTea

20060515 10:25:53 nbsp Oh I love this place, especially because it is next to my job at the Varsity... the food is quite good, spicy, and filling.  I have ordered the NDD and Chicken Tikka Wrap, both of which were scrumptious, I reccomend the NDD wrap if you like somewhat spicy food, and I also got the Chicken Biryani for $9.99.  The Biryani is HUGE and really good.  The food here is very flavorful, and their staff is very willing to help make your meal better in any way they can.  Their mint sauce is slightly lacking though.. but besides that .. A+ Users/JulienBiewerElstob

20060601 13:55:27 nbsp Although the food was excellent, in the end I found the place sort of gross and the staff completely rude.  My experience got off to a rough start immediately after my plate was delivered to my table and I watched a green bug nosedive into my potato salad and attempt in vain to fight its way out.  I was also sitting in a corner seat which allowed a view of the kitchen that I would have preferred not to see.  Finally, I waited for more than 10 minutes after trying to pay the bill as the waiter struggled to get the owner off his cell phone to run my credit card.  The owner  or manager or whomever he was  made it clear he was not going to be bothered until he was done with his personal phone call  and the restaurant was empty except for me!  Terrible, terrible service. Users/CarrieFisher

20060604 15:58:03 nbsp I got the chole bhatura and kheer(sp?) the other day. the chole bhatura was okay. The pudding was rancid! I think, it went bad and the workers didnt take a notice. it was the most disgusting thing I put in my mouth. Users/PattyLouieJunior

20060605 09:29:30 nbsp Ive been here twice, and received good service.  So not all servers are bad!  The food is absolutely delicious!  The ambience is soso.  Yes, the fridge is too loud.  Yes, the decor is pretty tired.  But this is much better than having a dazzling restaurant interior and mediocre food! Users/MattJurach

20060729 20:22:10 nbsp I went here for a quick lunch while I was at Kaplan. I settled on the Tandoori Wrap which is pretty good. Its a little expensive at $5.39 after tax though. The service was fine since I got my food to go. Any recommendations on things that are good togo besides the wraps? Users/LiRic

20060806 14:51:15 nbsp After reading many reviews, I really wanted to try this place.  The food had wonderful spice and flavor, however we went through 2 waiters.  The first one decided to take a brewsky brake in their bar a few feet away.  Went there for dinner and it was a little pricey.  Also, ask for the student discount...as I failed to read closley restaurant wiki page details. Users/JoeCustomer

20060808 21:56:01 nbsp overpriced for the amount/quality of food, asked for a recommendation on a vegetable dish and got chunks of cheese that had no flavor, overall a very disappointing experience Users/MelodyWon

20061023 14:13:00 nbsp I ate here a few weeks ago. The special was goat vindaloo, which sounded good for $9.99. When I got the meal, it appeared to be a good sauce populated with big chunks of meat. However, the big chunks proved to be bone instead.  There was  no more than 2 oz. of meat in the dish. So, essentially, 10 bucks for rice, some sauce and some bones. The waiter was trying hard, but apparently didnt know how to pour a pitcher of beer properly. Users/GrantNichols

20061115 17:14:07 nbsp As an IndianAmerican and diehard lover of Indian cuisine, I am so pissed off about the lack of quality in the food served by the 3 establishments in downtown Davis.  Its apparent that these restaurants either dont have much of a clue as to how authentic Indian cuisine is prepared (uh, naan should never come out of a packet, let alone be served COLD) or are making every effort to pinch pennies and take advantage of a community who has no better options for an authentic Indian meal.  This is outrageous and embarrassing, particularly because I know of several people whose first experience with Indian cuisine was here in Davis; they were so turned off they swore it was their last.  Whoever said New Delhi Chaat Cafe approximates the quality of Viks in Berkeley is full of shit.  If youre going to run a restaurant, make it worth your customers time, and get it right. Users/VivekMathrani

20061213 20:44:12 nbsp I got the buffet on the weekend and it was not good at all.  Nothing in the restaurant seemed authentic when I came in.  I did not see one indian person in the whole place!  The rice was undercooked and most of the entrees were very plain.  This ranks below Rajas for taste and certainly service.  I will try again, however, and order off the menu. Users/JohnHumperdinkle

20070107 12:49:47 nbsp The NDD wrap and the Samosa Chaat are delicious.  I cant tell you if its authentic Indian food or not but my friends and I go here a lot on our lunch breaks.  I do think the price is a little bit high for what they serve.  Maybe if they lowered it a little and spice up the interior, they could get a little bit more people eating there.   Users/BeeBooBee

20070110 18:32:10 nbsp Last night we ate here (1102007) and we have mixed reviews. My boyfriend got the Lamb vindaloo which is usually his favorite dish. Unfortunately, at Chaat, the vindaloo was almost too spict to eat, and did not have the pleasant rich flavor that one comes to expect. I ordered the chicken tikka mosala, at the advice of our waitress. My food was much hotter than I expected, but VERY tasty. We also ordered the Pakori Chaat to start it was amazing, but we were very glad that we ordered the naan with it, it was bits of pakori(according to the waitress tasted a little like fried bits of onion and maybe some sort of dough) in a yogurt sause. We will certainly order the Pakori Chaat and the Chicken Tikka Mosala in the future. Oh and the water tastes horrible, but I guess that is what we get for living in davis :) Users/DaraRabin

20070211 17:04:20 nbsp food was okay but portions not so big. I ordered the lamb curry and it was delicious but so little! not worth the $14. And service is BAD. The waiter was rude. Users/KiwiSelina

20070317 14:23:45 nbsp Nothing to write home about but the waiters are nice. Users/CandiceWang

20070328 14:33:28 nbsp The lamb vindaloo was too spicy to taste, it bordered on inedible, and I adore spicy food. The chicken tikka masola is spicy, but has wonderful flavor. Users/ColinWard

20070403 22:22:56 nbsp I LOVE the veggie wraps.  I crave them.  I try to eat them as much as possible.  Very filling for a smallish girl, I usually have to eat the whole thing in two sittings.  Also, the garlic and cilantro naan is really really good, great for garlic lovers.  Never tried anything else. Users/Lisa

20070519 03:26:09 nbsp Im sad to say I just heard today that New Delhi is closing, I believe their last day is Sunday.  Theres a sign posted in the front windows about a change in ownership.  Apparently the new owners are going to close and do major renovations and then reopen as a, er, I believe the term used was Indian Bistro.  I dont believe the wait staff will carry over, no idea on anyone else involved (like the cook(s)).  Ill miss ND. Users/BillBroadley
