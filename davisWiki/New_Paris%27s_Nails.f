20070422 11:44:49 nbsp I really like it here. They give you your own special files, new, to bring with you each time.  If youre a student, let them know and youll get a discountat least $5 off their advertised price.  The woman does excellent fills, never has made me bleed or my fingers hurt  like some of the other salons in davis have. The woman does an excellent job, but I wouldnt trust the man at fills because he usually does the pedicures.

Highly recommended! Users/madanielelwicz

20070422 13:34:47 nbsp Grammatically, shouldnt it just be Paris Nails? Users/KaiTing

20070519 14:34:41 nbsp Grammatically, you add s to signify possession of a singular noun, even if the noun ends in s (like a Rosss house or Pariss nails). The lone apostrophe is added to the end of the word when it is a plural noun ending in s and you wish to make it possessive (like several kittens whiskers). Users/CoryUnruh

20070727 10:52:25 nbsp Even though the hours are posted from 107, they dont really open at 10. I went there today at 10:30 and they still werent open, and I went there the day before at 6:30, and they told me to come back the next day. I really liked it here, but they need to change their hours if theyre not ready to open or close at those times. Users/Sandrapanda98

20070813 14:03:28 nbsp Sometimes we have other appointments in the morning or in the afternoon thats why we open/close the store different than the hour shown. Please call to make an appointment if you want to come in early or later than 6pm. Users/TuyetPhuong

20080215 18:13:42 nbsp I have to say, Ive tried at least 7 places for fills in Davis, and this is by far the best of them all.  Once you get over the initial shyness and tell her what you want, she will get your nails perfect every time.  Shes never made me bleed, my nails never peel off in the first week, in fact, Ive had a fill last up to 5 weeks without falling off.  I highly recommend this place.  Not to mention that they are super clean, and give discount cards so that you get a free fill or a free pedicure after x visits (i think 10?).  With the student discount and the free fill it comes to like 13.50 a fill, which for me is totally worth it.  I just had to come back a second time and say that after a year, this is still the best in Davis.  Ive even come in to have her fix what other nail places have done!  They have won my loyalty.

20080317 16:24:00 nbsp They do totally awesome pedicures! They guy there gives the best foot massages that Ive had done by a pedicurist. The polish lasts so long too!  Users/Rachelottlinger

20081115 21:57:34 nbsp The place here is really clean, and the owner/workers are friendly. Very sanitary. Each customer gets their own file when they leave so you can take it back and use for your next visit. I had a french pedicure done, and the man did a very good job. My toes came out lookin neat and the paint is still on even after 2 weeks. They have 20% coupons that you can use too! Users/gato

20081121 17:42:51 nbsp The lady did a fantastic job on my acrylics.
The man.... didnt do such a good job on my friends French Tip.
Maybe it varies?  Overall they are really friendly in here and its pretty cheap. Users/renee415

20090503 11:54:45 nbsp I came here for the first time on Friday, May 1st. The lady was kind and took me in right away to do my french manicure. Shes very attentive to the details and my nails came out looking great! As with everyone else, I received the bonus card, buffer, and nail file! I really like them and am likely to return! Users/kg18

20090519 22:03:22 nbsp I havent been back in awhile but I dont hate this place. The salon has ZERO ambiance and the huge mirrors in front of the foot spas are lessthan ideal, but overall I was happy with my pedi. I have been frequenting this new and fabulous spa at the Woodland Mall for the past few months, but if I am ever in Davis looking for a pedi I will definitely consider this place again! Users/ArianeMetz

20091027 17:48:52 nbsp nice people but environment is so so, like a hole in the wall so so. not as man colors to choose from compared to other salons but mani/pedi are adequate. you get you own files and buffer to take home and back so that minimizes germs. prices are good, college student good. nothing compares to sf salons but this is where i go when im in davis Users/tapioca.queen

20091118 14:28:38 nbsp They are extremely friendly here.  My acrylics came out great too.  i always come here when i want to get my nails done. Users/ElizabethLee

20100711 22:22:04 nbsp I went here 3 months ago to get a manicure/pedicure and they were great! The lasted a long time! (about 2 weeks). I went here 2 weeks ago and this place is now called Amys Nails with a new owner and same prices. Looks the same on the outside but they made remodeled it a bit to be more spacious inside.

20100823 20:01:47 nbsp I just moved in Davis with my BF and I was looking for a Pedicure/Manicure shop.  And I found Amys Nails.  The place was really clean and Amy was very nice and friendly.  My nails are also gorgeous and I love them. My BF too! BTW Amy and her family are the new owner of the place. They seem to be a hard working family too. Users/camelliajoun
