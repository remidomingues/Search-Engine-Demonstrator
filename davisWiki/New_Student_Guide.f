Purpose:
The purpose of the new student guide is to accelerate the integration of freshman and transfer students into the campus community as well as life in Davis. (See also Freshman Guide and Transfer Student Guide)

Information to Include:
  Map of campus and downtown area perhaps.
  A short basic checklist to get people started off with bicycling and such in Davis.
  Information regarding the ASUCD and the services offered therein.
  Information regarding the services offered by the campus, such as the ARC and UC Davis Bookstore Bookstore.
  A list of informative resources for new students and transfers to refer to so that they may learn more.
  A brief calendar of upcoming events.
  A guide to the student associations, where they meet, and who is in charge.


I know people may think that this is a bad idea because that information is easily accessible from the internet, rather nearly all of it can be found on this site, however a printed copy is a bit more useful and hence people are more likely to read it. Just to note there already is a guide for Hispanic/Latino students, but I am not 100% positive about it.

20061214 09:27:08 nbsp Perhaps this page title might be converted to a disambiguation page that simply points to existing pages. Users/AlphaDog

20061214 09:44:17 nbsp Well this is a page for a project, a physical publication, as disambiguation would be good, I think that the links provided would be sufficient in that regard, no? Users/MichaelReagan

20061214 14:12:34 nbsp Theres far more information here than would probably fit on a single sheet of paper. Perhaps a better application of this concept would be to create Guide fliers advertising the wiki... ticklers to draw new people in. For example, you could create a 5.5x8.5 Freshman Guide sheet using information from the Freshman Guide page; this flyer could have a footer that reads, looking for more tips? look to the Daviswiki!

20061214 15:04:01 nbsp Definitely an idea, as this was also a project to promote the Daviswiki ( which I have to thank for much of my good experiences in Davis), in any case, this is a project to be done over winter break, and probably the guide itself will be best for next year, when there are new students and such to promote a guide to, for now.. Dont Panic. Users/DavidPoole
