New Years Day, according to the Roman Calendar, falls on January 1. However, the New Year of the Annual Events calendar year has less significance to students, who generally feel the new year begins in August or September (depending on whether theyre on the quarter or semester system).  The New Year under the lunar, Judaism Judaic... or most any other calendar tends always to fall on a different day.

The day before New Years Day is called New Years Eve, and falls on December 31 of the Roman calendar. People often throw parties with alcohol and fireworks, and a countdown to midnight is common.

  Nothing changes on New Years Day.
