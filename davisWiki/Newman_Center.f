 History 
The Newman Center was originally the second site of St. James Catholic Church St. James Catholic Church.  The first chapel was built in 1875 but burned down in the early 1930s.  This chapel served as its replacement; it was dedicated by Bishop Robert Armstrong of the Sacramento diocese.  In 1935, Bishop Armstrong established the Aggie Newman Club at St. James, appointing faculty advisors Lloyd Doneen & Harold Olmo to direct the club for Catholic university students.

As the St. James community continued to grow, parishioners saw the need for a larger church hall so they moved the parish to a property donated by John & Mary Lillard, one of the Davis most prominent families, on the corner of 12th & B Streets.

In 1964, Bishop Alden Bell purchased the old chapel to be used as a center for Catholic campus ministry.  Just three blocks from the UCDavis campus, it was an ideal location for a Newman Catholic Student Community.  The first director of the Newman Center was Fr. Andrew Coffey, who became a monsignor and is currently a pastor emeritus at St. James Church.  The original parish rectory, a twostory house next to the chapel served as the office and residence of priestchaplains until 1973.  Since then, chaplains have lived away from the Center so that the building could be used exclusively for staff offices, a library, and a community meeting space.

Shortly after the Center began to operate, the interior of its Romanesque style chapel was renovated.  The preVatican II arrangement of the original parish church has all the pews facing east towards the altar.  These pews were removed and replaced by 250 stacking chairs.  The choir loft was removed, the original wooden floor was carpeted, and the altar was moved to the center of the south wall.  The chairs now surround the altar on three sides.
 Sister Mary Pat White Controversy 

In 1997, William Wiegand, then the Bishop of the Diocese of Sacramento, requested the Newman Center comply with diocesan regulation and liturgical norms. The Center under the previous Bishop Quinn had been known for innovative liturgies, parishoner homilies, and lay sharing of Communion under its director Sister Mary Pat White.  Sister Mary Pat also had been sharing Eucharistic prayers and concelebrating with priests during the celebration of Divine Services. As a result, Sister Mary Pat was transferred following the directives from the Diocese.  In protest, community members and faculty of UC Davis led a protest from Davis to the Cathedral in Sacramento.
