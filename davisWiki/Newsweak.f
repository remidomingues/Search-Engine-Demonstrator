NEWSWEAK EXCLUSIVE: Davis Wiki launches coup, overthrows ASUCD

layercake: Computer nerds show surprising strength in violent assult

By Matt Jojola and
Daniel Stone
Editors in Briefs

Daviswiki.org, a Davis information website, launched a military offensive at 3:27
Tuesday afternoon, storming the Memorial Union in an attempt to take control of
the ASUCD Senate.

The attach was led by Rev. ChadVanSchoelandt, a prominent Davis Wiki user, and
his posse of Orwellian, fanny packwearing vigilantes.

Were just so sick of the association, VanSchoelandt said as he picked up a
table from the ASUCD Coffee House he later threw at winter election runningmate
KristenBirdsall.  With the elections over, we had nothing exciting to put on the
Wiki, so we decided to cause our own controversy.

After the walls of the MU were breached by Davis Wiki insurgents, Coho patrons
were reported to have immediately evacuated the building in a scene reminiscent
of the reaction to news that Prince William was single again.

Senators holding office hours on the third floor during the raid raced to attempt
to jam the elevator shafts.  After Davis Wiki cofounder
PhilipNeustrom broke the elevators computer codes, the vigilantes crowded the
elevators beyond occupancy limits and ravaged the third floor within
minutes.

ASUCD President CaliphAssagai said he was enjoying listening to Enya while
painting a mural in his office when the Davis Wiki group enterred.

I was just relaxing and painting over former ASUCD President KalenGallaghers
mustang when all these fanny packs were thrown at me, Assagai said from a
makeshift war prison in the engineering department.  I didnt know what to do,
so I just cowered in the corner, yelling for DarnellHolloway and DevinWhitney.
But they didnt come.  No one came.  it was like I was running this school all by
myself.

Assagai expressed interest in continuing to speak with The California Aggie, but
was dragged away by Davis Wiki cofounder MikeIvanov, a selfproclaimed warden of
the prison.

The 12 members of the senate could not be contacted after the assault, though are
reported to be hiding in Sen. RobRoys car, which he had previously claimed as the
best housing in Davis.

When the attempted coup ended, VanSchoelandt found the original copy of the ASUCD
Consitution, which was ratified in 1996, in Business Manager MarkChampagnes desk.
Witnesses told The Aggie that VanSchoelandt ripped the wordy 500page document in
half with one pull.

The campus suffered a farreaching power outage as the result of the offensive.
UCD technicians blame a fuse blowout on hordes of Davis Wiki users who simultaneouly
attempted to upload pictures and edit statistics on the page created for the event.

 The Wiki Tank 
Should Davis Wiki ever get an armored tank, where could we store such a vehicle so that those in ASUCD and The California Aggie wouldnt find out about it? Or more realistically, keep it out of ASUCDs reach, as they would undoubtedly retrofit it to launch tube socks.

>from the The California Aggie: Spoof edition Aggie spoof Newsweak<

  The Hunt Wesson Plant has a lot of open space behind a locked gate.
   Pro: Can store a whole division here.
   Con: Not a lot of buildings to provide cover  youd need to bring your own camouflage.And it no longer exists...
  The Unitrans garage can house some tanks
   Pro: Easy to get fuel for CNG tanks.  Can mount turrets on El Fuego.
   Con: Unitrans is kinda an ASUCD unit, though they dont interact much.  Theoretically someone could tip off Mark Champagne.
  Secret Base under Toomey Field
   Pro: Right next to MU; good attack vector (exits in North Entry Parking Structure)
   Con: Getting Clearance.
  Plenty of open space in Winters
   Pro: No one ever goes to Winters
   Con: No one ever goes to Winters
  In a hangar at University Airport
   Pro: Nice covered facility to http://sfgate.com/cgibin/article.cgi?f/news/a/2004/12/08/international0356EST0439.DTL upgrade armor
   Con: Tank doesnt actually fly
  Kalen Gallaghers old afro.
   Con: I thought we were attacking ASUCD
   Pro: Can assist in attacking The California Aggie, however.

20050819 16:55:41 nbsp Why not inside the fire station? Users/ScottRitchie

20050819 17:49:52 nbsp What is the length of a tank?  Could it fit in the Farmers Market and be covered in camouflaging produce? Users/JabberWokky

20050819 20:15:00 nbsp Hell yes. Or perhaps out at the Equestrian Center... we could use it to deliver hay? Users/CindySperry

20050820 04:15:32 nbsp Ballastic Hay Delivery...  Hay! kerfwump Users/TarZxf

20050820 10:42:52 nbsp I want to try parallelparking that thing downtown.  Users/BlancheNonken

20050820 11:08:37 nbsp nothing piques the appetite like a jolt of fearlaced adrenaline... really, its better for the horses that way! I mean, wed be conditioning them to believe that military equipment and flying flakes of hay go together... Users/CindySperry

20050820 14:37:51 nbsp There is already lots of stuff besides airplanes out at the Airport, like the Antique Mechanics Club and there are other people who have antique cars in hangars too. Users/NickSchmalenberger

 Comments on Newsweak 

Such great advertisement for the wiki.  Users/GeorgeLewis

This is best thing in the world.  Anyone have a scanner? Users/PhilipNeustrom

How did they find out about Students for an Orwellian Society our plans? Users/BrentLaabs

Blatant ripoff of most recent spoof.  Users/ArlenAbraham

I read it and noticed that its kind of close to the truth. BTW, did you all notice how they attributed their quotes?  Users/KenBloom

  it would have been funnier if they attributed them: {{{Blah blah Davis Wiki blah.  PersonName}}}  Users/ArlenAbraham
    I think it was good asis.  A stroke of subtle genius!

{{{Users/KenBloom}}} says that if the {{{Aggie}}} had done an article with the ordinary {{{journalistic writing style}}}, but pretended to {{{link}}} things using {{{WikiCode}}} it would have been best.

This is Users/TusharRawat my new favorite page.
