The idea of the Featured Page is to highlight a good or otherwise interesting article.

Writeups (On Deck)
Write up a short hook, include an appropriate image, and post it here!  Then we can edit it to perfection and post it. The photos should be scaled down to around 320 pixels for the largest dimension. Once there are some good ideas feel free to change the Featured Page!

Note especially the part about the short hook.  The featured page isnt meant to tell the whole story; its meant to hook the reader to click on the page where the fuller story can be told.

Proposed new writeup:

The City of Davis http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2012/06/08/daviscutscitytreetrimmerscitizensconcerned/ has let go of our trees tree crew! Immediately following the passage of 2012 City Council Election/Measure D Measure D, city manager Steve Pinkerton http://davis.patch.com/articles/treecrewlaidoffdayafterparktaxpassedlettertotheeditor announced the dismissal of Davis only tree crew. These fellows not only maintained the citys 18,000 trees, they also hang and remove the banner on B st., install owl boxes, installing the Christmas tree on E st., hanging ornaments, removing ornaments, dispose of  Christmas tree, installing reflective tape on structure at the train depot, help install and remove antennas on towers that were too tall to reach, install cable on a flag pole for the bomb squad, and deliver wood chips for volunteer projects. Pinkerton has promised further cuts in city staff, which will presumably result in a further reduction in services the city provides.
   The page needs a photo before it becomes a featured page.
    http://daviswiki.org/Street_Trees?actionFiles&doview&targettree_lined.JPG This seems like a good image for that blurb.
      Yes, that could work.
   The Trees page itself needs photos.  Should we just take some from T. Elliot Weier Redwood Grove pages like these and add them to Trees?
     Thats a good idea.  cp

  Poox  shows how much Davis residents love their pets.
  Critical Mass  We have some cool photos already.  Plus, it would be neat to see if a little frontpage promotion could push this into a bigger and bigger event.
  WhymCycles is very Davis and also really colorful.  Users/JabberWokky
  Students for an Orwellian Society, but probably wait until a time when the club is more active again. The Labster
  Choice Voting and how it works would be great sometime before November. Users/MikeSiminitus
  Comfy Chairs would be a good featured page if someone took some pictures.  Users/ArlenAbraham  Pictures taken! Users/WesHardaker
  Disc Golf would be a good featured page, but maybe Im bias.  Users/JanelleAlvstadMattson
    Its summer time and most everybodys got a frisbee  but few have probably played on these courses..Maybe that kind of spin?

  Fruit and Vegetable stands  maybe needs a bit more text?
  Human Powered Housing Project  needs slightly more descriptive text, despite the fact a photos worth a thousand words
  Emma Goldman Institute for Anarchist Studies  Needs a bit more info, I think.  But its nifty!
  Moving Day  Seems like an obvious choice come late August.
  Unique Vehicles or perhaps one of its more specific pages, such as Little Green Electric Car
  Expired Campus Elevator Permits  Maybe well attract some positive attention and get new permits.  Users/ArlenAbraham
  Shelly Bailes and Ellen Pontac  The next time a relevant date comes around (Pride Day, etc)  jw
  Airsoft  just needs a photo of some people playing, maybe some more text
  Buffets  needs photo
  Vegetarian Options  needs photo, awesome page
  Forties  funny page, prone to being out of date, but might want to feature it while its still up to date

  AllNighters  studentcentric, but still pretty good
  Chiles Mansion  As an undergrad, Id never heard about this.  Its a really interesting and depressing story.  Might need a photo and some other editor contributions
  Davis Judo Team  Well written, loads of pretty pictures, and not obvious if youre not actively looking for them.
  Tank House  Interested to figure out what that things is. This page has since had a lot of information added to it.  Its a delightful and interesting read, has photos, and I think is a perfect candidate for a featured page Users/PhilipNeustrom
  Toasts  would be a good one for the holiday season!
  Christmas  another seasonal option
  Downtown  Lots of new people in Davis at the moment, lets make it nice for them?
  Household Hacker  Awesome, hilarious videos and at least one of the guys lives in Davis!

Discussion

20110512 14:59:59 nbsp Users/JabberWokky has suggested featuring some longtime Davis businesses as featured pages.  I like the idea a lot.  What are some good criteria for picking them?  Id suggest the following as a few criteria: 1) At least 10 years old (opened in 2001 or before); 2) Have a good, interesting history written up on the page.  Could be info on the people involved, the location(s), events there, whatever.  Something that makes it an informational page for Davis, not just for the business itself.  Thoughts?

The second thing is obviously to come up with some good options.  ACE Hardware is a fairly interesting one.  Hibbert Lumber and Redwood Barn Nursery could both be great candidates if they get filled out a bit more.  The Graduate is a true Davis institution... the writeup is a bit of a mess, but with some work, and especially with a few phone calls to get some more historical information, it could become a perfect candidate.  Delta of Venus also looks like a good option.
Users/TomGarberson

20110512 16:49:06 nbsp For Delta, I noticed there were no photos of the interior, so I took some... also shot photos of all the chalk menu boards.  Ill be going through my photos tomorrow. Users/JabberWokky

20120304 23:14:42 nbsp As important as the protests are, I think with elections, Picnic Day and other things approaching, it might be time to consider when to move forward with the Featured Page. Users/JabberWokky
  I have been thinking the same thing.  The protests continue and the issues are still important, but they are no longer center stage and other topics deserve attention as well.  We could do a quick switch for the election, which ends tomorrow, and then segue to Picnic Day.  (Or plastic bags.  :)  ).  Users/CovertProfessor
  I agree as well. Time to switch to another topic. Users/SimonFung
  Well, the dramapocalypse is nigh. The big report on the pepper spray incident will be released. Tomorrow will be interesting. Users/WilliamLewis

20120404 10:51:06 nbsp Dental Questions tomorrow? Users/JabberWokky
  Sure.  cp

20120711 17:13:31 nbsp Maybe Ill put up a local video contest as a featured page?  The election is kind of old news.   Users/JeffShaw
  Rule #1: The featured page should feature a page.  If there were a detailed page to feature, of which the local video contest was a part, that would be cool.  Users/CovertProfessor

20130328 13:11:36 nbsp Time for a new featured page  ideas? Users/CovertProfessor

20130530 13:35:18 nbsp Id like to elect dumpster diving as the next featured page.  Its a page, not an event. Users/jefftolentino
