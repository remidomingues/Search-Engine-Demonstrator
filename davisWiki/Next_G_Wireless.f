Next G Wireless is the only TMobile exclusive store in Davis. This store claims to offer the most competitive prices on  Cellular Phone cell phones and cell phone equipment in the Davis area. FlexPay is open for any individual who does not wish to pay deposits or enter into a contract agreement. The FlexPay option has monthly rates very similar to that of a twoyear contract.
Prices are subject to change without notice. 2yr New is based on a $39.99/month contract. Special conditions may apply.

The store also appears to have an iPhone unlock service to allow an iPhone to be used with any wireless provider for $30.  Probably the only store I know of thatll unlock phones.  Interesting.

20071213 16:18:35 nbsp This place is awful.  I went there last year to get a Sidekick II, the advertisement said it would be free with a oneyear contract.  The guy working, Jonathan Nasca, lied to me and my friend, we were charged $80 per phone and said we would get a rebate.  We got no rebate, and the headquarters refused to give us our money back.  The accounts had the names and addresses mixed up, and we were unknowingly signed up for a twoyear contract instead of one.  By far, the worst wireless store Ive ever dealt with.  Users/campbellb

20080402 12:40:02 nbsp Got a new phone here in late March.  The guys here werehelpful and the prices was great. Overall, Tmobile has good reception pretty much anywhere in Davis, comparable to AT&T, which I have used before.  Users/CClaw
