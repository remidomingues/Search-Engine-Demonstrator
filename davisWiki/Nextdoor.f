In July 2012 Davis announced a new partnership with Nextdoor, a free social websites social network website, which it hopes will facilitate communication among neighbors in a secure online setting, because God forbid they meet or communicate in any setting that isnt online and secure!  Details http://www.davisenterprise.com/localnews/city/citylaunchesnextdoortobringneighborhoodstogether/ here.  Note that they require address verification, either by phone (if possible), by credit card (they make a 1 cent charge), or by postcard.

An oddity: once someone in your designated neighborhood signs up, your neighborhood has only 21 days to reach a critical mass of 10 members.  They ask you to solicit your neighbors to reach that critical mass, which raises the question: if you have good contact with your neighbors, then why do you need Nextdoor?  And if you dont, how are you supposed to contact them?
