My names Nicholas Barry, and Ive been living in Davis since 2003 when I came here as an undergraduate. I studied Economics and International Relations, and finished a masters degree in Public Administration at USC in July 2011.

Here are a few places you might know me from (or if you dont know me, places or ways you might meet me):
  I launched the Davis Dollars Davis Dollars community currency, and am currently its executive director.
  Im a district representative in the district office of http://dist06.casen.govoffice.com/ Senator Darrell Steinberg in Sacramento
  The incredible N Street Cohousing has been my home since 2009.

Some material from my old, deprecated NaBarry profile. I changed profiles so I could have a profile that used my whole name.

See my old profiles statistics below.

20071209 16:12:36 nbsp hello. do you know about the Wiki BBQ Jan 2008? Everyones invited, so if you want to let other people know, feel free to copy and paste this. gracias! Users/JessicaRockwell

The 0  3 at UCD shirts are free. Just ask http://healthcenter.ucdavis.edu/hep/ these guys for one.

20101121 06:15:19 nbsp Hey, I just wanted to say that Davis Dollars is a great idea.  As a minor aside, I rather liked the old profile. Users/JabberWokky
  Thanks, Jabberwokky! Both for the comment and for the copyediting on the DD page. I did have fun with the old profile page, but felt it had been up for quite some time. Ill probably do something a bit more fun soon, when I get around to it.

20110520 17:03:20 nbsp I can now say, without insulting you, that I always sounded out your old editor account in my head as Sodium Barry. Users/JabberWokky
  Wonderful! Thats funny. Thanks for sharing!  Users/NicholasBarry

20110520 19:25:10 nbsp Great new entries!  Thats really useful info. Users/JabberWokky

20110928 13:59:29 nbsp Why the redirects? The redirects youve created dont seem necessary. You type the name of the redirect into search and the first result is the page that the redirect redirects to... until now where the first result is a redirect. Users/WilliamLewis
  I was thinking that it would be more convenient to be able to link like this: {{{Robert is a locksmith}}} than like this: {{{Robert is a locksmiths locksmith}}}. But Im not overly attached to that way of doing it  do you think the convenience of being able to link easily and naturally is outweighed by the page coming up in search? Either page will get them to the right place, so Im not sure theres a big problem with them both coming up in search. nb
   Basically all such pages are in the plural, because the page itself is about more than one  that is, the page is about locksmiths rather than locksmith.  If we do the singular for locksmith, should we have a singular for the hundreds (thousands?) of other such pages on the wiki, too?  Makes kind of a mess, and the link is misleading.  I agree that there is a linking convenience to using the singular, but then again, its not that hard to link with the plural.   Users/CovertProfessor
   Hmmm...Ok, I see your point. Any other thoughts? If not, Ill take down the redirects and fix the links. nb
   Yeah, the linking is a mild inconvenience, but it keeps the wiki as a whole quite a bit tidier. Users/TomGarberson
   Yes, good point, Tom. Ok, Ive made the changes. nb
    Thanks for discussing it and for making the changes! tg
  One point for discussion: are redirects of that sort acceptable in the case of a page like Cafés/Cafes? Making the Cafes page a redirect to Cafés saves users from needing to look up the special character for the é, which isnt easy for everyone. I realize that wiki gnomes and editors could go through and correct all the times people link Cafes instead of Cafés, but in that particular case I would argue that a redirect is easier, since it allows the nonobservant editor to make a link that will actually work, and wont require cleanup by another user. And cases like these are few enough that it wont really clutter up the wiki much. nb
   I think in general that this has already been done, and I agree that it would be good to do it in places where it has been overlooked.  An oddity with cafés  there is no link for cafés, only a link for cafes.  cp

20111110 12:29:48 nbsp Thanks for the fixes on Davis Dollars! Users/TomGarberson
  No problem! nb

20111206 09:42:33 nbsp Yes, having the page organized by categories, with information in the sections as well as pictures, would be better. Im still not 100% crazy about the idea, but it would be better. Also, I am also wondering if you think the changes to Explore help.  Im sensing that you still think that there is a need for a separate Businesses page.  Users/CovertProfessor

20111206 10:15:19 nbsp Oh, I just removed it because theres an overwhelming number of templates already, and I think its better not to have a template for that kind of stuff, so as to encourage novel and nonheterogeneous entries of that form.  Without double checking, I think the comment referred more to the fact that Sacramento was referenced a few times in it.  (Not that I have any problems with Sacto, as I lived there before Davis... well other than the loss of True Love Cafe). Users/JabberWokky

20111206 10:51:37 nbsp One thing to keep in mind is that I see a delete as just another edit to the wiki, not something final.  So if it comes from me, dont see a delete as anything more serious than something like tightening up wording.  Its simply another edit.  Thats why I had reverted the version of Businesses with all the broken links and said something along the lines of revert back to here to resume editing.  The wiki is perpetually in flux, and what is absolute today will be yeah, thats left over from something else two years from now. Users/JabberWokky

20111206 11:00:21 nbsp A revert is a threat.  Break out the pepper spray! :) Users/TomGarberson

20111206 11:09:53 nbsp Yeah, if youll notice with the current Nov/Police entry, most people reverted once, kind of voicing their opinion.  Jeff continued to revert until he found somebody willing to play games with him.  Silliness can happen, but the first set of reverts were all done once by different people.  Id say thats healthy.  Of course, its now progressing to an exercise in headbutting, which only leads to headaches. Users/JabberWokky

20111206 11:21:33 nbsp ...and now the Talk page fills up with the views that didnt fit in the revert notice field. Users/JabberWokky

20111211 19:55:52 nbsp Do you by chance, know why the Sacwiki Test is no longer showing edits made within the last week? Users/jefftolentino

20111212 09:37:37 nbsp Thanks for the response, sir.  Ill keep keep the test nature of the site in mind, (glad someone held on to that trace though).  The gathering sounds useful.  Postholiday timeframe would be most workable for me. Users/jefftolentino

20111223 08:12:55 nbsp Nicholas, it looks like you provided the two photos for http://www.davisenterprise.com/localnews/davisdollarsaretakingrootincommunity/ this Enterprise article.  Interested in uploading them to the wiki?  I think theyd be nice on the Davis Dollars page. Users/CovertProfessor

20111225 20:08:40 nbsp Thanks, looks great!  No worries about despoiling. Users/CovertProfessor

20120105 18:04:32 nbsp Im confused... will the flea market be at the Farmers Market?  Or some other time/place? Users/CovertProfessor

20120106 16:29:52 nbsp Ah, you really had everyone guessing.  :) Users/CovertProfessor

20120106 16:49:50 nbsp Thanks for the invite, but this quarter is going to be insane for me.  Im going to try to keep my wiki editing to a bare minimum.  Failing so far, obviously. Users/CovertProfessor

20120106 16:52:12 nbsp Id be into a get together, but probably cant do it until after the 25th, (will be in the philippines).  I was also thinking it might be worthwhile to post some fliers in midtown and some of the colleges.  Kind of a legwork task, but it would be good to get Sactown folk involved, since its really their town.  Some sticker bombing might work as well. Users/jefftolentino

20120111 16:54:36 nbsp you are welcome, I just wanted to make you aware!

also sorry, I had been up for quite some time and I may have come across a little loopy {{{^__~}}} Users/StevenDaubert
  no worries, it happens to all of us!
    Stevenyour loopiness is part of your charm. Id love to sit and chat over a meal sometime...perchance you come to Upstate NY sometime, dinner is on me. Likewise for Nick but he knew that already Users/PeterBoulay

20120117 17:51:21 nbsp You can delete and repost it now.  I just added you as an Events editor.  Keep in mind that a delete is unforgiving: there is no revert for events, thus the Event editors list.   Users/JabberWokky

20120510 19:53:22 nbsp Thank you for the explanation.  I agree that while the negative actions of a representative reflect poorly on the organization, overall my interactions with you and with other Davis Dollars folks, and my impressions of your actions, have been positive.  The main thing that would change any negative impression, in my view, is having the new editor become a genuine contributor to the wiki  not just someone who edits for internship reasons, but who makes other contributions.  Someone who complains about the look of the front page hasnt quite yet gotten it  its their wiki, too, to edit and to improve. Users/CovertProfessor

20120511 08:27:01 nbsp The only thing I had a problem with was the name.  And I was upset in part because its a shame it was associated with a cool project like Davis Dollars.  Your intern made a mistake.  It was pointed out.  I think everythings fine... hopefully those edits will be buried under continuing ones about the growth of Davis Dollars. Users/JabberWokky

20120511 09:59:21 nbsp Yes.... a new requirement for all Davis employment... Must be a productive editor of the Davis Wiki.  Ha! Users/CovertProfessor

20120514 11:54:27 nbsp Its not a bad idea  in fact, its a great idea  as long as they are genuine contributions, as you said before. Users/CovertProfessor

20120530 16:32:29 nbsp Congratulations on big step forward! (CoOp & Davis $$$$$$$). ☺☺☺ Users/ConstantiaOomen

20120601 08:46:33 nbsp John just paid with Davis Dollars @ CoOp Davis for the first time! He bought vegan marshmallows and barbecue pins (vegan purpose) with it. ☺ Users/ConstantiaOomen

20140126 15:47:15 nbsp I was sad to see that the Cheung Hing grocery/deli on 11th Street in Sacramento is closed.  Since you work on the Sacramento Wiki, maybe you know of other places to get wonderful baked bao. Users/SueHjerpe
  Sorry, Sue, I dont!  Users/NicholasBarry
