Nicholas Nick Park is a candidate for ASUCD ASUCD Senate Senate in the Fall 2013 ASUCD Election running on the NOW slate.


 Candidate Statement 

Hey there Aggies!

My name is Nick Park and Iâ€™m excited to be running for Senate this quarter with the NOW Slate. I am a secondyear Managerial Economics major from Pleasanton, California and I am determined to make UC Davis the best campus possible for both current and future Aggies. I currently serve as an intern to ASUCD Senator Felicia Ong and ASUCD President Carly Sandstrom, and have worked on initiatives such as the 5K Stride for Aggie Pride and the ASUCD Scholarship.

I want to be your next ASUCD Senator because I am passionate about improving campus and bettering the Aggie experience!

IMPROVE ORIENTATION FOR INCOMING STUDENTS
Orientation is an important time for incoming students to learn about our campus, get excited to attend UC Davis, and make new friends as they transition to college. Currently, orientation falls short in fulfilling these goals. I want to enhance firstyear and transfer orientation by planning interactive tours of campus, utilizing the quad and downtown for social activities, and getting students the information they need through online webinars instead of fourhour long lectures in SciLec. I plan to work in partnership with Student Housing to accomplish this and ensure that our future Aggies leave orientation excited to return to campus in the fall.

INCREASE CALFRESH AID TO STUDENTS
The CalFresh program currently offers funds for food assistance to students approved for a work study award or to those who meet certain income and work requirements. However, most students who qualify for CalFresh are unaware of their eligibility. I want to increase awareness of the CalFresh Program to eligible UC Davis students by working with the ASUCD Pantry and the campus Financial Aid office so that students are aware of the program and its benefits. Ensuring that every student is afforded the opportunity to an education without sacrificing their personal wellbeing is a cause that I am deeply committed to.

I look forward to serving you and enhancing the college experience for both future and current Aggies! Please remember to VOTE NICK PARK #1 FOR ASUCD SENATE AND NOW #26!
