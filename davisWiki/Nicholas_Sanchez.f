Nicholas Sanchez is a candidate for ASUCD ASUCD Senate Senate in the Winter 2014 ASUCD Election running on the SMART slate.

 Candidate Statement 

Hello Fellow Aggies,

My name is Nicholas Sanchez, and I want to represent YOU by serving as one of your next ASUCD Senators! I am a second year Political Science major from Stockton, California. I am currently serve as the political chair for Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztl√°n M.E.Ch.A, and I am working to help disadvantaged students get into college through my job in the EOP Early Academic Outreach Program. Additionally, I previously served on the Ethnic and Cultural Affairs Commission, where I advocated for underrepresented students.

I am running with SMART because I truly believe in the ideals of SMART by enriching UC Davis through activism and empowerment of its students. I want to represent and advocate for all Aggies in order to make UC Davis a better experience for its students and communities.

If elected, I plan to work on the following initiatives:

EXPAND TIPSY TAXI SERVICE

ASUCD provides a valuable resources for students that is not accessible to all undergraduate students. This is due to the limited hours Tipsy Taxi operates under and the insufficient number of taxis out. As an ASUCD Senator, I will work with the Tipsy Taxi Director to extend its hours and to get more vehicles on the road to improve accessibility for students.

REVAMP ACADEMIC PROBATION/SUBJECT TO DISMISSAL PROCESS

Being on Academic Probation and Subject to Dismissal can be a frightening experience for any student. I am sure we know someone personally affected by these frightening and stressful situations the current process creates. I plan on working with the all Colleges on revamping the Academic Probation and Subject to Dismissal process to better help students! If elected, I will create a better system that does not rely on cryptic emails and interviews, but rather video tutorials and various online resource guides for students each step of the way.

VOTE NICHOLAS SANCHEZ #1, SMART #25, AND Armando Figueroa FIGUEROA/Maxwell Kappes KAPPES FOR ASUCD EXEC.
