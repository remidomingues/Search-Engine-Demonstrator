The wiki is like a katamari that rolls up stories. Describe Nick Schmalenberger here.
I Townies grew up in Davis and like it, especially Tap water Davis water. I now live in the bay area working for http://www.conviva.com Conviva. On Davis Wiki, I like to see active discussion about Davis in a very free and Bakers Square highly linked mesh topology way like Katamari Damacy. My hobbies are collecting comic books, reading, bsing with people on Davis wiki, learning about UNIX and computer programming, Yolo Amateur Radio Society amateur radio(KG6PIP), caving, and being outside (does a cave count as outside?). I like to ride my Bicycling bicycle around town and go Hiking and Backpacking backpacking, Davis Back Country Skiers skiing, and Putah Creek canoeing. I am an Eagle Scout from Troop 111. I am usually in the daviswiki Davis Wiki IRC irc channel and on AIM as nickzxcv. Someday I would like to visit the wiki:WikiPedia:Isle_of_Skye Isle of Skye, because I like the name, among other places such as wiki:WikiPedia:Phoenix_Sky_Harbor_International_Airport Sky Harbor, to which I hope to go back some day. I think Sky Harbor is the most beautiful and melodious name for an airport I have ever heard.


My favorite comic book series is wiki:WikiPedia:Girl_Genius Girl Genius by wiki:WikiPedia:Phil Foglio Phil and wiki:WikiPedia:Kaja Foglio Kaja Foglio. It is a webcomic now, here: http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/, but it was in print for thirteen issues and I own all of them in single issues, trade paperback, hardcover, or all three. I also like Neil Gaiman, Fables, Star Wars, and lots of other science fiction and fantasy, including the book http://www.librarything.com/catalog.php?work248529 Darkmage by http://www.librarything.com/catalog.php?work248529 Barbara Hambly. I am one of the few geeks in the world who has read Enders Game (twice, both assigned) and didnt like it. I have an account at http://www.librarything.com/profile/nschmalenberger Librarything. My favorite Star Wars movies are IV,II,V,III,I,VI in the order of my preference from best to worst. Firefly/Serenity are amazing and much like my favorite Star Wars episode, A New Hope. I also like to read some other webcomics and play games like Nethack. People on the wiki who make a hobby of passive aggressively bothering other users about their username or other wiki activity annoy me. Reading Sams Mediterranean/Politics makes me laugh, but people who think other people belong in a zoo and the Daviswiki is it bother me.
Kettle of fish.

20091125 03:20:44 nbsp Hmmm...while I have no penguins on my computer, I did enjoy your use of the word melodious in your description of the airport. Chhatrapati Shivaji International in India doesnt quite roll off the tongue, does it? Thanks for your nice comments about my blog! Users/jsbmeb

20091125 07:33:08 nbsp Hey, Users/ScottWeintraub left a cryptic message on Subway that indicates he may need a helping hand.  Or not: it is awfully cryptic.  Still, I think (and it is only my opinion) somebody should reach out to him and see what he meant in case he needs help. Users/JabberWokky

20100104 22:31:23 nbsp Well, I am guessing that the person who originally wrote that thought that students, who on average tend to be young and healthy, might not have much experience with health care and so not know the right thing to do in an emergency.  Maybe that person (I havent bothered to see who made the edit) even knew some students who had made the mistake.  I figure, at worst it is condescending and at best it might help someone.

20100112 08:43:40 nbsp Her only edits to date have been via a comment box.  It is plausible that she wouldnt be able to figure out how to reply without one.  Having a bit of communication would certainly encourage one to figure out how to edit the other two ways.  (Unless youre implying but not saying that shes not a new editor, which I am unaware of).

20100128 18:13:27 nbsp Nick, not sure if youre a guy or a girl, but I have nothing nice to say about davis.

20100227 18:16:33 nbsp Nick, if William hadnt cleaned up the pages you removed JabberWokkys four color notices from what would your solution to those pages have been? Were you planning on addressing the issue of a what appeared to be a single entity having four duplicative pages? Im curious if you had something in mind beyond just removing JabberWokkys attempt at a solution? Users/JasonAller

20100311 21:55:14 nbsp Thanks Nick!  I just went off of one source, and unfortunately it was all UCD stuff.  I recall reading about a book on Davis history somewhere around here that might be fun to pick up and further fill things in.  Thatll probably be on hold for a while, though. Users/TomGarberson

20100327 20:03:30 nbsp Nick, whats the best way to reach you? Users/NathanielVigeant

20100329 09:15:38 nbsp Girl Genius is probably the best comic Ive ever read. My household is a huge fan of it!

Sadly, I dont understand the edit you made to my profile. :( Users/Adalwolf

20100525 17:23:01 nbsp I like sushi. Users/JenniferCook

20100526 22:10:07 nbsp Argh, I wish:  Ill be at Fanime by then, and Ive got work on Thursday for the entire day.  I leave immediately after work for home, too, so I can get to Fanime early.

Thanks for the offer, though! Users/AlexanderHo

20100528 09:42:56 nbsp I unfortunately have class at that time. Probably a good thing too because I tend to take allyoucaneat as a challenge but I am attempting to cut about ten more pounds in case my shoulder gets better by tomorrow and I am able to compete in a Judo tournament tomorrow. Users/hankim

20100528 09:55:40 nbsp Thanks, I will be needing it desperately to survive.  Users/hankim

20100528 18:39:55 nbsp I work at 1:45pm, so I may or may not be able to pop by. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20100602 08:06:06 nbsp It is just a nomenclature error that bugs me.  Just like when someone pronounces nuclear nukeUler .  I dont think it is bad that the two are compared, I just wish people understood that wikipedia does not equal wiki. Users/DagonJones

20100602 08:07:53 nbsp btw, is girl genius a good comic?  I thought it looked kind of goofy (not that that is a bad thing), is the story good and the characters well developed? Users/DagonJones

20100602 10:13:57 nbsp Heh, just a positive externality of procrastination. (: Users/EBT

20100602 13:01:54 nbsp Stop hiding, Nick! Users/BreeButler

20100605 20:43:39 nbsp But was it intentional?  I think it might have been a mistake! Users/CovertProfessor

20100609 04:42:05 nbsp get to sleep Users/StevenDaubert

20100611 21:51:13 nbsp Hi Nick, thanks for your comments on my user page. I disagree with your point though. From my perspective, thats exactly what makes the Wiki so great: When I made the mistake of not signing out of my account (that I was using to teach Vaage about Wiki, because he wanted to have an interaction with a DickLiddle  hmmm), I was able to go back and correct the error without having to consult a professional or justify the action to anyone. Would appreciate feedback. Users/TimQuick

20100612 14:34:48 nbsp Ah! Sorry for getting back to you so late! I dont check the wiki every day anymore, so I didnt see your message. Sushi would have been cool. Users/TaniaG

20100613 13:08:20 nbsp Oh yeah, the revert option. Thats good counsel. Thanks. Users/TimQuick

20100613 15:44:48 nbsp Ill have to look into that 24 hour sleep awake syndrome. . . I may have it.  We may even need to add a page.  Who knows who else is suffering from this debilitating disease!  :D Users/CurlyGirl26

20100615 08:27:00 nbsp Yep, thats really the bigger problem, in my view, but together theyre a disaster. Users/CovertProfessor

20100709 06:44:47 nbsp Do you want it to turn nonpassive? Users/JasonAller

20100709 18:41:16 nbsp If you feel that way then by all mean either ban them, or start pages calling for their bans. Ill probably argue that it is better to reach out to them and explain why they are being banned rather than just banning them, but lets see how it plays out. Users/JasonAller

20100710 08:22:12 nbsp What is your call on Users/teenclinic? Ban for org account name? Users/JasonAller

20100726 00:08:54 nbsp William and Nick: Davis definitely is short on electronics supplies. I mostly go to Best Buy because it is closer to where I live, and I basically hate Frys. I see your point. That page looks a little bare, though, with just a couple of grocery and drug stores and one big outoftown retailer.  Users/DonShor

20100726 00:10:39 nbsp http://www.farmland.org/americasfavoritefarmersmarketsstates.asp#CA


If you love the Davis Farmers Market.. vote and spread the word. we are 40 votes behind Rochester, New York...  The only other Farmers Market even close to the number Davis has so far. Users/WesOne

20100729 01:02:47 nbsp Its disrespectful to Sam, harmful to his business, and involves an event that may or may not have happened years ago. Sorry to be so peremptory, I probably should have communicated with you first.  Users/DonShor

20100729 10:42:08 nbsp Would it work for me to drop by maybe Friday evening to pick up the tabling stuff? Users/TomGarberson

20100730 08:37:16 nbsp Nick, I saw your comment to Cary Arnold.  When I searched on Davis Life Magazine, about 95% of the links I looked at were broken.  I only went through about 3040 hits of the ~170 that TG had counted.  Are you proposing that someone should search for the correct link for each of those?  Thats quite an undertaking  certainly not one that I am willing to undertake.  In my view, to really do it right youd also have to incorporate some of the DLM story into the wiki page, and I definitely dont have the time for that! Users/CovertProfessor
 If we had correct links, I think adding a little blurb to each page would be the sort of thing to do over time.  If a few different people each did 10 a day, itd get done in a week or so, and it wouldnt be that big a burden.  Of course, wed also need to find the right links... tg

20100730 19:09:53 nbsp Hey Nick, the problem with the Davis Life links is that the old site wasnt archived at all!  There are no links to redirect too. Users/Davidlm

20100811 08:20:53 nbsp Thanks for your comments! Ill be riding the octopus almost daily, and Ill let you know how it goes... Users/AliPezeshkpour

20100903 17:14:18 nbsp I am deeply saddened that you are gone. First Users/ChristopherMcKenzie Chris left (and Users/ErikAnderson Erik, Users/JessicaRockwell Jessica, Users/JeffreyNonken Jeff, Users/MichelleAccurso Michelle, Users/RevChad Chad & Users/MarieHuynh Marie), then you and Users/WilliamLewis William, so I have no more friends in Davis. None on this planet, none in this lonely universe. Nobody to help me; nobody that cares in the slightest about me. All alone against the enemies. Users/SteveDavison

20100921 19:00:14 nbsp Thanks for the info. Really too bad Im working from 9 to 5 that day >.<

I recently realized that if I reformat I will lose my seriously awesome tetris scores, and that makes me sad. Users/JenniferCook

20100921 19:04:39 nbsp Not to mention I dont think I meet the hardware requirements. Doh! Users/JenniferCook

20101001 16:39:14 nbsp I laughed out loud at the demoting flippancy comment Users/TomGarberson

20101001 16:52:02 nbsp I dont think you should refrain from editing just because youre not in Davis.  The contributions of editors outside Davis have been invaluable.  Just because you might not have Davis experiences from the last X amount of time to relate doesnt in any way invalidate your years of experience with the city and the community. Users/TomGarberson

20101005 14:48:48 nbsp Thank you for reverting the firearms page.  Im getting tired of people casually dismissing my edit to that page for petty reasons.  I appreciate the help! Users/RickJames

20101201 22:46:06 nbsp Hey Nick, it looks like Railroad Fence and RR Fence Op Ed are identical pages.  The latter has a lot more discussion with the easytofollow edit history, so I thought itd be better to keep it.  You have http://daviswiki.org/Railroad_Fence?actiondiff&version228&version127 one comment on the former one.  Im going to delete the relatively empty onehopefully you wont mind copying the comment over, if youre still curious about the answer. Users/TomGarberson

20101202 10:00:08 nbsp Yeah, Im pretty sure youre right.  The one you posted the question on was created first, and probably had a better name... but it didnt get as much love, so it fell by the wayside. Users/TomGarberson

20101202 10:14:42 nbsp Yeah... its also just not what anyone is claiming the fence will do (Im assuming).  Theres a big difference between its worth building because it might save lives, despite the cost and inconvenience and it will prevent ALL railroad deaths in Davis.  Many of the arguments there seem to be responding to the latter, even though I doubt no one has actually suggested that. Users/TomGarberson

20101207 10:58:58 nbsp I agree!  How could people forget the trains when we see and hear them all the time?? Users/CovertProfessor

20101207 11:07:26 nbsp It may be like that old saying, Familiarity breeds contempt. I could see how someone who has lived near the tracks for a long time would basically stop noticing the trains, because they have effectively become furniture, which is to say, something that can be safely ignored unless it is needed.  Users/JoePomidor

20101218 20:55:02 nbsp Messy wiki pages, while in and of themselves are not a bad thing, interfere with the goal of communicating information.  From my perspective, a poorly formatted page fails to communicate (high noise:signal ratio) and bothers me the same way that txtspk does.  When u hv 2 think hrd abt wat u R readn, u need moar tm 2 read per unit volume of communicated text and its horrible, really, because the text comes across with the implication that one either does not know enough not to use the format outside of text messages, cant not use it, or do not care about your readers.  I dont like to decode 140character communication shreddies; I prefer polysyllabic Latinderived descriptive language. Users/JudithTruman

20101219 13:35:41 nbsp Ive not read the /politics or /debate pages, so I dont know how rambly they are.  As they are controversial topics I would be okay with communitydebate threading down wiki if there were sufficient internal markers to track debate points.  As far as PSI goes, I didnt know what the organization was or how one joins it, so I went over to the main page, read it, and learned that its a join for $X thing not a exam to show skills thing.  The prominence of PSI on that page gives it slight misleading note to casual passersby.  I can renew my professional society memberships for $X00 and then I get a magazine subscription, too, but the threeletter acronym that would mean something costs $1500 and four 12.5 hour consecutive days of written and practical testing. Users/JudithTruman

20101223 09:07:27 nbsp Your viewpoint on validity of Street Name Themes is still filtering in my brain.  Theme Streets is just a redirect for now.  I was thinking that expresses common Davis parlance of Bird Streets etc.  not totally sure about it.  Also I had trouble remembering Street Name Themes. Users/BruceHansen

20101223 17:59:30 nbsp Please tell me what the difference is between the names and the streets.  Are Christmas lights a theme for names?  Thanks. Users/BruceHansen

20110212 09:54:25 nbsp Im glad it amuses you. Im sure it doesnt amuse the owner. Please allow that issue to rest in peace.  Users/DonShor

20110228 20:22:20 nbsp There was an email from Lauren  the deletion was intended to delete a negative review.  I replied and cced in Jason (who restored the entry) who can hopefully help get Lauren more on the wiki (and anybody else can help too!).  Sometimes theres a bit of a hurdle for those first steps to actually know how to communicate with other participants and find help on the wiki. Users/JabberWokky

20110307 11:18:59 nbsp I cant really be the spokesperson for all people and/or wikipeople that use nicknames for others. In the case of Compassion Guy, I didnt give him that name; it was used in the article in The Aggie that you can view on the page I created for him. Youll also notice that his real name is next to his nickname in the wiki entry. As for nicknames in generalthey are just that: nicknames. As far as Ive learned between some art history and sociology classes, our brains like to categorize things we see and hear to keep brain chatter manageable. This might explain the reason why nicknames or monikers such as Visor Lady exist. Especially if one doesnt know someones real name, our brains like to say, Oh, theres that lady again with the visor that Ive seen around town a million times. That gets translated into monikers like Visor Lady. Thats my best quick explanation. Users/EliseKane

20110307 11:34:47 nbsp p.s. If you read the intro someone composed on the Town Characters page, the language used implies no disrespect but rather reverence for these distinctive individuals listed. I have included that intro below, from whoever wrote it, and capitalized the words that I believe are used in appreciation of the Town Characters: Just like every other town, Davis has its own DISTINCT and MEMORABLE characters to LAUD. People get included in this list for many reasons. Some are listed to CELEBRATE and HONOR the distinct or INTERESTING ATTRIBUTES that make them VISIBLE INDIVIDUALS IN A SEA OF SAMENESS. ROCK ON, characters — youre the people who will be REMEMBERED long after the nondescript faces walking along the sidewalk are forgotten!  Users/EliseKane

20110307 16:13:36 nbsp Well, you can continue to find it offensive and I will continue to find these names interesting. I dont really see what the point is in discussing it. You obviously are taking a confrontational and provocative approach to this, but I prefer to let something as harmless as this let lie. What is your point in using aggressive language in asking me about something that you already have your mind made up about anyway? Please refrain from discourteous interactions in the future or I will not respond to your posts at all. Users/EliseKane

20110308 10:51:11 nbsp Ah, yeah, I tend to think that Davis water is something of a personal taste thing. I, for myself, hate hate hate the flavor, and Im really looking forward to getting water thats as good as the stuff I get at work in Rancho Cordova. I can see where those who like Davis water might be put off, though... Users/JoePomidor

20110318 00:51:09 nbsp Re: Volunteering at AX  Nah, Im good.  Heck, Im not even working Fanime this year.  Thanks, though! Users/AlexanderHo

20110331 20:21:49 nbsp Thanks Nick! Im glad you like the Japanese page so far. Users/ScottMeehleib

20110602 11:53:09 nbsp Considering you were up at 12:15am on the Davis Wiki, I will not consider you in the con artist group, at least you were up to some good not causing shenanigans.
You can appeal my ruling however. Haha
 Users/NikhilDahal

20110814 22:24:46 nbsp I agree Nick, but I dont really know what to do about it at this point. I dont understand why more people cant understand that its mainly an issue of basic respect and privacy, and in my opinion, has very little to do with political correctness.  In my understanding, these sorts of pages are even of dubious legality under U.S. privacy laws definition of what makes for reasonable public disclosure.  Users/ScottMeehleib

20110814 22:44:07 nbsp And really, those laws are there for a good reason. Not everybody enjoys or benefits from being in the limelight. It reminds me of the Star Wars Kid from a couple years ago. The kid basically had a mental breakdown and had to switch schools and get psychological help. Obviously, these entries are not on a national scale as that video was, but I think the basic idea is still applicable and similar enough. There was a huge lawsuit involved in that case, and yet many people couldnt understand why the kid couldnt get over it since it was a video that he himself actually created in which he was expressing himself. But the video was leaked without his permission, and thats the key difference between acceptability and unacceptability in a case dealing with people who arent celebrities or acknowledged public figures. Users/ScottMeehleib

20110814 23:14:12 nbsp And even if the trike is interesting, it probably isnt unique enough to be newsworthy which is another criterion for public disclosure. Thats another thing I think you were getting at in your comment. If it was shaped like the Batmobile or something then it would be different because desire for public attention would be implied. Its really gray area as it stands. On this wiki wiki where people are often so gungho about deleting advertisespeak to protect the wiki, I find it ironic that most have no problem letting this sort of thing stand. Users/ScottMeehleib
Newsworthyness is a candidate for TOW, for something to find its way into Davis wiki it merely have to exist in Davis... Daubert

20110815 02:48:24 nbsp What you said as far as PC being respect without empathy makes a lot of sense. I never thought of it that way before, but I think you hit the nail on the head. There is a sense of lifeless formality that people associate with the guidelines of political correctness.  Users/ScottMeehleib

20110816 14:37:28 nbsp So if I dont know the guys name, then I should rename the page about him so it is about his trike until such time I learn his name... then I can change it back?  Users/WilliamLewis

20110816 15:07:03 nbsp We should avoid slam book pages, I agree.  I think the better question is whether any of the contested pages actually ARE slam pages?  Other than the name Electric Trike Guy is there anything you contest specifically? Users/EdWins

20110816 15:33:44 nbsp Ok, but the Yellow Electric Trike page had the exact same page content as Electric Trike Guy. I dont know if that change at all actually addresses the issue/your comment.  In a way, William is kind of right.  As you just said, people want to know more about the guy/his name...the focus of the page is still the guy, not the make/model of his electric trike.   While Electric Trike Guy might be odd and could be reworded, I think yellow electric trike as a page title is off topic.  However, the bigger issue is really the question Electric Trike Guy/Talk CP is asking.    Users/EdWins

20110816 16:23:17 nbsp I reject your poisonous, unstated, and unproven assumptions that...
  It is dehumanizing to state what is known about someone when ones knowledge is incomplete, especially when more complete information is difficult to acquire.
  It is malicious to do the above.
  It is dehumanizing to bring attention to people who are different from the norm, especially when these people are extremely visible in a community. Users/WilliamLewis
      And I reject your poisonous assumption that such a generalized norm actually exists and that is somehow a reasonable activity to publicly categorize people by normal and abnormal traits.  Users/ScottMeehleib
      If such a norm didnt exist, would any of the town character pages exist? It is ridiculous to attempt to deny this. As for whether or not this is a reasonable activity, I cant argue with your opinion. I can say that the wiki exists to document what people see and hear around town. wl

20110816 20:46:31 nbsp Well, theres nothing wrong with standing up for a principle you believe in.  I dont think thats being selfrighteous, and its not hypocritical to want to draw a line somewhere.  I definitely understand what youre saying, though I also agree that its a bit difficult to put into words.  With the trike guy, it does seem a bit like were just picking on someone without much money and with mobility issues.  Yay. Users/CovertProfessor

20111206 19:23:57 nbsp Im confused by http://daviswiki.org/November_18%2C_2011_UC_Davis_Police_Response_to_Occupy_UC_Davis?actiondiff&version2618&version1617 this comment  what does it mean? Users/CovertProfessor

20111206 19:38:25 nbsp Ah, ok, thanks.  Yes, I get frustrated too when all of the focus is on the pepper spraying incident or the Chancellor.  Its important because there needs to be accountability and a change in policies to allow for future protests, but as you say, sometimes the original reasons for the protest get lost (although, in fairness, the original reasons did include police overreaction to protest at UC Berkeley).  However, Im starting to think its unlikely that this Chancellor will resign or be asked to resign, which in my mind is all the more reason to focus back on the core issues.  Sorry, my head is a bit muddled today  hope that makes sense. Users/CovertProfessor

20111208 14:13:33 nbsp Thanks for the comment. You could say the same thing about many great people early in their life. Im not by any means saying Gandhi was perfect but you could quote some of the things that Malcolm X said early in his life and that doesnt necessarily reflect who he was trying to be at the end of his life. I was using Gandhi to highlight the need for nonviolent, noncompliance when there is a corrupt system with corrupt laws. Burning passes in South Africa, the salt march in India. Hope that explains my point a little better. Gandhi himself didnt like being called Mahatma meaning great soul and being held up as an idol but it happens  he accomplished amazing things.
