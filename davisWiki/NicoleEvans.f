Hey, Nicole... a very belated welcome to the wiki, and thanks for the fixes your made!  I noticed you deleted an entry because it was no longer current.  The wiki documents Davis, both past and present, so there are many entries on things like World War II or General Merchandise and Grain (which had the telephone number 1).    I restored it and the link, and made it clear in both that it was a past activity, documenting what has happened before the current crop of members.  Of course, its equally important to add new stuff, so thanks for adding the Coffee House to the sushi list. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
