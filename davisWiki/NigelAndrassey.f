Winter 2006 Elections

For my own idle amusement I have created the following horse race style odds for the current ASUCD candidates.  As of the first day of campaigning I estimate the odds as follows.  Candidates are listed by initials, parties are in parenthesis (Lead, Focus, Indepentant and iGnite).

Executive Office:
Lead (L)  18:7 (72%)
Focus (F) 7:18 (28%)

Senate:
NA (L) 2:1 (67%)
DR (L) 2:1 (67%)
MM (G) 3:2 (60%)
KR (F) 14:11 (56%)
RD (L) 7:8 (47%)
MZ (L) 7:8 (47%)
JR (I) 11:14 (44%)
RN (I) 2:3 (40%)
AV (I) 9:16 (36%)
AB (L) 1:2 (33%)
GA (F) 8:17 (32%)
ML (I) 7:18 (28%)
JB (L) 6:19 (24%)
JL (G) 1:4 (20%)

The above are the odds updated as of midnight 02/23 / 02/24.  Doubledipping, ie competing for the same votes, caused several candidates to lose odds due to more highly favoured members of their own party.

PM (F) 3:5 (37.5%)

ER (I) 3:8 (27.3%)

RP (C)  1:7 (12.5%)

I think the number for Nevins (LN) came out a bit higher than Id like, but Im tired of tweaking it.  In fact Id predict her coming in sixth, but removing odds from her would add odds to everyone else so Id have to do all the calculations over again.  It should be noted though that the odds are NOT equivalent to number of votes, just odds of being in the top six, so one could say there is a 62.5% chance that LN will come in sixth. Also I have absolutely no idea really what to do with Ajlouny (GA) since no one has ever run for reelection before so theres no precedent.  Anyway, heres the numbers.


20060224 15:03:54 nbsp Your prediction was nearly perfect, in terms of the raw figures of who was elected (not by how much).  Your only mistake was not predicting a win for GA! Users/PhilipNeustrom

20060224 18:19:22 nbsp Yeah I predicted the wrong Focus member ( Users/NigelAndrassey

20060224 18:36:51 nbsp You should have recorded it on a tape, put it in a lockbox and made a $1000 bet with Xentertainment tonightX The California Aggie Users/ArlenAbraham

20060224 18:42:32 nbsp thats pretty amazing, I wish the elections results were posted right now so I could figure out how george did win... Users/JamesSchwab

20060224 19:25:32 nbsp yeah wheres the stovetop?  Users/NigelAndrassey
  Alex Park says itll be up on Monday.

20070123 16:00:31 nbsp Mr. Andrassey. Do you think you will publish predictions for the Winter 2007 ASUCD Election? Users/MaxMikalonis

20070125 17:07:16 nbsp Yeah Im up for it.  Considering the large number of candidates, if anyone could help me compile information which might be relevant Id appreciate it.  Such information includes physical attractiveness of candidates, participation in influential organizations, etc.  It does not include anything about their platforms incidently because that doesnt actually effect the vote ) Users/NigelAndrassey

20070223 00:02:14 nbsp Woah.... I definitely think nevins is a bit higher, but then again, she was in my top 6, and I know a lot of people voted for her because, well, shes an actual human being. Definite Black horse..... This goes against everything Ive been thinking about and following, esp. considering ERs campaign flyer was an endorsement of all the LEAD candidates. But hey, youve got the experience, and this could be Very Interesting. Users/MaxMikalonis

20070223 00:05:13 nbsp Yeah I ran ER as a Lead extra.  Im assuming the various supernumerary candidates dont have particularly good odds since the rest of their teams arent really pushing for them.  Though shes still rated better than half of everyone else.  Also if these are way off Id like to disclaim that Im way out of the loop these days. ) Users/NigelAndrassey

20070223 00:08:33 nbsp Well, also, turnout for Unitrans broke 20%, but then a lot of people who voted for that didnt proceed to rank Senate/Prez, or only did their top vote, because (among other things) they werent interested in reading candidate statements (sounds familiar) and didnt buy the sound bites.
