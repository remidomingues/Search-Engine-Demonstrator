Davis can be strange and eerie at night. When murders of Crow Migration black crows fly overhead, Stolen Bikes thieves scurry about, and unless the fog rolls in, you can Stargazing and Space Sightings see stars.  It can feel like Davis is the setting for a spooky places scary movie. Some people refer to night time as dark time.


Once night comes along, the little Cockroaches bugs come out.


You run into these little critters scuttling all over Campus at night, as well as some spots Downtown. As evening falls, you may be in search of entertainment (especially in the Summer in Davis summer when evening brings a drop in temperature) or somewhere thats still open to grab a bite to eat. This page is a place to assemble information about things that happen and things to do during night time, and, really, anything else related to the night.  Most businesses in Davis close fairly early, so, whether you’re in dire need of caffeine while pulling an allnighter for tomorrow’s exam, meandering around after last call, or simply bored out of your gourd, its important that we all know whats open late and what our options are!

  Theatres with Late Films 
     There are mainstream movie theaters in Sacramento that have shows at late as 10:40, but thats only about 20 minutes later than Davis shows films.  However, there are a lot more movies playing late out there.  Perhaps the best option is to rent a movie for now.  Unless someone has better information....
