Nikita is an Alaskan Malamute / Wolf hybrid. These dogs are notorious wanderers, which I discovered early on. In fact the first day I had her it was a warm spring day and I had opened the doors and windows of the house.  She was very attentive from early on, so she listened very well, and although I had not yet named her, she responded to command without issue. Until I got on the phone to tell my friend, Steve Fleming that I had picked up this dog.  At which point she ran right out the front door. This response to my own lack of attention would be repeated many times in our relationship.
