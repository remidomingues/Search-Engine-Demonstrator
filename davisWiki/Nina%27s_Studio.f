20090206 21:29:59 nbsp I came two days before my graduation and asked for a color and full highlight. I explained that I wanted to dye my hair to its natural color (my roots were grown out about 3 inches) and to have the same color highlights all over. The stylist explained to me that I may be able to get away with highlights only on the top and no hair color because it would save time and money (she was double booked and running back and forth from me to another client). I explained to her that my roots are very obvious and that I usually fix my hair all the way up or half way up and that partial highlights wouldnt fix that my roots will still be showing. After being at the salon for 4.5 hours, I was completely devastated. The complete top of my head was almost fully blonde (I am naturally a dark brown/almost black hair color) while the rest of my hair was an obvious lighter color brown with 3 inch dark roots. It looked horrible!!
I started to cry as she straightened my hair and told her I did not like it. She just kept telling me it was nice and I just wasnt use to it. As soon as I got home and all my roommates told me  my hair was horrible I called and told them I wanted my money back or have it redone. The stylist told me she did not have time and gave me a lot of attitude. Instead of talking to me she just handed the phone over to someone else. I was able to have an appt with her assistant the next morning. When I came to have my hair redone the stylist I had the day before made me pay $100 more because she said the $160 she charged me was only for a partial highlight and not a full. That was the only time she spoke to me the whole time I was there. I absolutely hate this stylist (I forgot her name) and will never go to this salon again because of this experience. Users/DPPL

20090320 14:17:47 nbsp I cant believe theres no comments for Vanessa Silva yet. She was my hair stylist for years before i started working for her and now she has become such a good friend and i will continue to come back long after i have graduated from UCD. She has a great personality and leadership skills to run one of the best salons in town. She encourages everyone at the salon to continue their education and stay informed on new styles and fashion trends. She has personally challenged herself to pursue the REDKEN color certification and approaches all color jobs in an artistic manner and personalizes your hair for what works best with your personality, hair texture, head shape, etc. She takes the time to explain whats shes doing and teaches her clients how to maintain their hair after leaving the salon. I have very difficult curls and Vanessa has taught me to love my hair by suggesting new cuts and showing me how to style it on my own.  Users/curlycueJEB

20090408 14:34:30 nbsp Vanessa is the best!  She absolutely saved my hair due to a previous color job. I have never had so many good comments on how my hair looks now and I cannot be more satisfied with the service there everyone is really nice and never stuckup like other salons in Davis.  And as far as pricing goes, if I had just gone to Ninas first I probably would have spent less than going elsewhere and then having to get it fixed. Users/rnavarro1988

20090612 15:31:18 nbsp I found Marjan and Rita!  Marjan (styles, color, cuts & Threading) and Rita (esthetician) had left Ninas in March and I was told by Ninas staff that they had left the area.  Not once, but several times they told me this. The truth is they are still in Davis and have moved on to nicer locations.  I have used the new esthetician at Ninas twice now and had poor results.  Waxing your legs is too painful to endup with strips of hair and have to have it redone in only a few weeks.  I am so happy to have found them both and very displeased that Ninas studio staff chose to lie to me.

20090701 10:05:12 nbsp LOVE LOVE LOVE Ninas Salon! I personally see Justin and he always hooks up my hair and has never led me astray. I am not that into popular styles, but after just giving him background on how much time I would want to have to invest in my hair every day, he gave me a style to fit! Have had my hair colored as well..always great. Have had friends have appointments with other stylists (Justin gets busy!) and they have never had a bad cut or experience. Also, I only have to go about every three months because the cuts always last and keep looking great even as my hair grows (obviously, I dont have a short cut!) Highly recommend. Users/JudyS

20090722 14:05:20 nbsp I got my hair cut here a couple of weeks ago, and am VERY happy with the result. Vanessa cut my hair, and I was really impressed that she actually paid attention to the way my hair looked before she started cutting. Unlike most hairdressers, she noted (without me saying anything) that I have natural waves, and she worked with my hair rather than against it. Most hairdressers, it seems, just assume I will straighten the shit out of my hair so they cut my hair accordingly, and my hair looks horrible when I wear it naturally. Vanessa cut my hair so that I can pretty much wear it without any product, and gave me a couple of hints too (none of which required more than a tiny bit of product). Plus no one tried to get me to buy any fancy product from the shelves, which I appreciated. All in all, the shampoo, cut and style cost $55.  Users/Kiran

20090828 13:55:47 nbsp We were walk ins and came for a hair cut.  We were seen pretty quickly and Ali did an amazing job.  Probably the best hair cut weve ever had.  Ali, you rock.  Well be back. Users/toriac

 20090829 15:17:32 nbsp I just had my hair cut and highlighted by probably the best stylist in Davis.  Julee ROCKS!  I hated my hair and she had some great suggestions and my hair looks great!  She was super friendly and very knowledgeable.  I will be going back for sure and telling everyone about her!  Thanks Julee! Users/mashelly

 20090829 15:36:25 nbsp I have always gone to see Julee to get my hair done and I have never been dissapointed. I am always 100% satisfied with my hair and my friends are always jealous! I am not very creative when it comes to describing what I want but somehow she always gets my hair exactly how I want it! Keep it up Julee and Im sure I will be seeing you again soon! Users/bluedevilchu

20090915 15:25:22 nbsp Just had a cut with Ian and I look amazing!  I had (stupidly) decided to trim my own hair, and (not surprisingly) butchered it.  Ian blended all my thick, long layers back together and made me beautiful again and he even opened the door for me when I left!  Hes a total sweetheart who looks like a bad a$$ and hes my hero today! Users/ElisaWeller

20091213 14:09:38 nbsp Ive been to a lot of hairstylists from LA to NY and have never had my hair done so professionally as I have with one of Ninas stylists Julee Villanueva.  She does amazing color and her cuts are so easy to style... one very talented lady...  Users/LOUBOB

20091231 12:00:10 nbsp I had a full facial by Jackie the other dayIt was lovely!! She is thorough, very gentle and adds a wonderful arm and hand/shoulder massage in addition. The products use (Dermatologica) gave me results I have been very happy withgreat scents too. I loved the tranquil decor and musicmade it all sooo relaxing and delightful. Great job Jackie. I want to come back!

Vannessa is the bomb! I love this galshe takes the extra effort and time to fully utilize her natural, blessed talent. I so appreciate her skill and professional wisdom. Thanks VanessaI love what you do to my hairkeep up the fantastic work!

I had a manicure/pedicure by Mai as well (great day!) Pedi soak could have been warmer, but I appreciated Mais warmth and efficiency. She knows her stuff and does a very nice job.

20100225 21:20:22 nbsp Today i called and got right in with Marnie. Shes the BEST! I needed a LOT of color correction and a haircut. She did both in no time and my hair looks amazing! I will be back for sure. This salon is very nice and their staff is lovely. LOVED IT.
ask for marnie...shell take care of you! Users/amelianeedham

20100318 18:09:43 nbsp I have gone to see Amanda a few times and she is great! My hair was in shambles from overbleaching and dying from previous salons and my own attempts at dying my hair, but Amanda gave me alot of advice and offered treatments to make my hair better. I never felt like she was trying to sell me anything, more just looking out for me and the wellbeing of my hair. The atmosphere is nice and Amanda works around my schedule to make sure I can get my hair done, she did it at 7:30 on a Saturday morning once and came to the salon early! I have never been disappointed and I would definitely recommend this salon.  Users/cj2012aggie

20100322 14:18:12 nbsp Every once in a while I want a new look so I go to Vanessa. What I appreciate the most is that she will walk me through the pro and cons of the new color or style. We will discuss how the style will compliment my face, how much time I should expect to spend on styling it, and what products I will need to use for that salon finished look. I had tons of compliments as a brunet with an inverted bob.  Users/TorresV

20100413 13:31:03 nbsp LOVED IT!!!!! I have super difficult hair (frizzy, wavy, and thick) to work with.  Stylist Vanessa Silva found a way to tame it and make it look amazing every time.  She customizes her haircuts and styling techniques to accompany the texture of your hair.  Not to mention her profound coloring skills.  Shes the only stylist I know who is redken certified.... and it shows!  She found the perfect redish color that looks bright but not too intense.  The price was reasonable for how much time she put in and, not to mention, the final product.  The style she gave me is easy to maintain and style on my own, especially since I do not put a lot of time into preparing and styling my hair daily.

Ever since my first experience with Vanessa 3 1/2 years ago, I have kept going back!  I highly recommend her to anyone!!!!!!!!!!! Users/MissAmyLu

20100513 14:51:19 nbsp My fiance and I both went to Justin yesterday and had a WONDERFUL experience. My fiances hair can be a bit unruly as its filled with (adorable) cowlicks. Justin crafted a cut that looks fantastic on my fiance and is very easy to care for!
I went in later in the day and am VERY happy with the cut I got. Well definitely be going back. Users/HelenDahlberg

20110702 11:52:46 nbsp I just had my hair done by Erica and she did a wonderful job, I will definitely be going back! Users/WikiChiki

20120317 14:05:04 nbsp Ian cut my hair. Do not go to Ian!

He complained the whole time about his allergies and the fact that he hadnt had enough sleep or eaten all day. I should have run away.

I specifically asked that my hair be trimmed evenly with no layers. He said he would take an inch off. LIAR!!! He took off at least four inches in some places and there are layers all over the place. He said as he was cutting, These arent really layers. Well, he needs a lesson, then, because they most definitely ARE layers! Not only that, its completely uneven because he cut my hair with it parted in the middle and then asked where I part it. Im so angry! Not only did he not do what I want, now I have to go to someone who knows what theyre doing to get it fixed.  Users/MelissaMelissa

20120904 16:51:37 nbsp So after one of my coworkers suggested Ninas Studio to me, I tried to stop by to check it out before I made an appointment. Check out the prices/hair dressers etc. I planned to go on Sunday. I guess I should have realized they might be closed, but their hours just say 106, so I figured that meant every day. Nope. Closed on Sundays. I accepted this and decided to come back another time. I got off work early today, September 4th. I showed up at 3:45 PM. There was a note on the door saying they were gone and would be back at 4PM. I was starting to feel like either I shouldnt get my hair cut or maybe just not here. I decided to wait anyways. After half of an hour of waiting, it was 4:15 PM and still no one had showed up. Finally a guy biked up and walked in, immediately came back out, locked the doors and left. I went to check if he changed the note to a different time. NOPE. Still said be back at 4). So thats when I decided I give up on this place.. they seem to have more important things to do than cut hair, so I will go elsewhere.

20121017 11:12:29 nbsp I have been going to Ninas studio for years, and absolutely love this salon specifically Vanessa Silva is absolutely amazing. I have unusual curly hair, and have always had difficulties with hairdressers not knowing how to handle it. Vanessa is a master of curly hair she is very good at making recommendations with attention to details such as face shape, part, glasses, etc., and is very conscious about hair maintenance and individual style. She has also introduced me to highlights, and has been amazing about making recommendations without being pushy. Ive referred friends to her (both with straight and curly hair), and we all agree that shes best hairdresser weve ever had. You will be surprised at what a difference an experience with someone like her can make in terms of the quality of a haircut. I may be moving to San Francisco, and I would seriously consider driving back to Davis for a haircut with Vanessa. Even if you could find a hairdresser in San Francisco with her skills, I bet the cut would cost several hundred dollars.  Users/hapinen
