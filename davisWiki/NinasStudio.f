The actual business page you probably wanted is at Ninas Studio.


Hi Ninia (or Vanessa?), Welcome to the wiki! Please check out our page for Welcome to the wiki/Business Owner business owners and the importance of using your realname. If youd like to create a new page for your business, search for the business name and then when nothing comes up, click create a new page with this title. and then select the Business Template. Once your new page is created, you can copy and paste relevant sections from the Allure Beauty Salon page. As a side note, the Allure page, as well as several of the other salon pages on the wiki, has had a long history of dubious commenters who create an account on the wiki, leave one comment in praise of the business, and then never contribute again. Judging by the language used in some comments, some of these may have been employees of the salon. Please set an example for the other salons in town. Thanks! Users/ArlenAbraham

20070810 18:41:19 nbsp Instead of posting that relatively huge (on my 1024x768 laptop anyway) flyer on this page, youd be better off putting a posting on the events board. Also, please see the comment I left on Users/NinasStudio your userpage if you have not already done so. Users/ArlenAbraham

20100109 11:19:56 nbsp Please close this account and edit under your Importance of using your RealName real name. Instructions on how to do so are on the Importance of using your RealName page. There has been discussion about people using Wiki Community/Organizational accounts organizational accounts and since Wiki Spot, who hosts Davis Wiki, got their 501(c)(3) status there have been some restrictions about Wiki Community/For Profit Restrictions promoting for profit businesses. We welcome your input, but prefer that you do so using an individual account rather than an organizational one. If you havent read Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner, please do so. Users/JasonAller

20100114 12:18:50 nbsp You could create a new page for Polly Felan, Esthetician, but before you do please start editing under your real name, because having a business page changed by an editor with the name of another business looks like vandalism and some editor is likely to revert all your edits. Users/JasonAller

20100125 21:03:44 nbsp Word documents like {{{Valentines Day Special.docx}}} arent really accessible to a wide range of people. Ill delete it as you didnt link it from the page. Users/JasonAller

20100129 13:54:56 nbsp A PDF file is more accessible than a word document, but in this case youve already ignored other input about Wiki Community/For Profit Restrictions. Why should you not be banned? Users/JasonAller
