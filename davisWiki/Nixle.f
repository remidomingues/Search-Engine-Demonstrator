Want to get announcements from the City of Davis to your email and/or phone during an Emergency Services emergency?  Or hear about other important cityrelated information, such as road closures?  Coming sometime soon,  you can.  Starting in January 2010, the City began promoting a citizen selfregistering email and text messaging notification tool from http://www.nixle.com/ Nixle.com.  One of the unique features of this new tool is that subscribers will be able to specify multiple locations, such as a home address, a business address and a childâ€™s school address. The city can then tailor messages to certain areas of town, if necessary.  See http://cityofdavis.org/cmo/pdfs/press%20release%20nixle.pdf City press release for details.

Despite the city promoting it and encouraging people to register, there are problems with registering on Nixle, demonstrating the cities lack of proper planning (or else plain bad luck).  It doesnt seem to be operational or useful for Davis, and its unclear on how to currently sign up, or whether its even working at all yet if you do.

A number of other local agencies use the http://cahan.ca.gov California Health Alert Network.

20100228 16:00:52 nbsp So far, I am not impressed with this, since its not clear how youre supposed to sign up.  Davis, CA or 95616 dont seem to be registered with them.  I could just give them my personal information and hope for the best, I suppose.  Not likely.  Maybe were not fully set up with them yet. Users/CovertProfessor

20100228 21:29:23 nbsp Why are we listing a service that doesnt seem to actually support Davis yet?  Let alone a service that when you put in 95616 it only lists 4 supported regions right now?  Id suggest we preface this with not yet working banner or something. Users/WesHardaker
  My thought was that the City of Davis seems to be trying to get Davisites to adopt it, so I thought Id try to help things along by creating the page  especially since information during past emergencies has been extremely hard to come by.  The City is linking to it now and seems committed to using it.  I dont know why it isnt working yet  Im not even sure that it isnt working yet.  Perhaps all you need to do is sign up as an individual, and it will send messages by zip code.  Im just not sure.   Users/CovertProfessor
   20100301 06:58:51 nbsp Um...  but the fact that when you do step 1 and it doesnt appear to support Davis seems to be both confusing and more likely not working yet.  The text above says its been adopted by the city and you should sign up, but Im not at all convienced we should be making that recommendation on this page until it actually works. Users/WesHardaker
     Yeah, I agree.  Nice page writeup, but I think its from a few months in the future, because it doesnt describe the current situation.  Hopefully theyll fix it up soon and we can revert to this version. users/edwins ES
      Then why is the City asking people to sign up now?   Users/CovertProfessor
         Well, the press release said that they will begin using without giving any definite date.  IMO, this is horrible planning: they shouldnt promote signing up for something that isnt set up yet, as itll just be discouraging and probably turn people away that would have used it. users/edwins ES

20100301 10:19:04 nbsp Davis is supported, but you have to let their autosuggest get it for you. Type in Davis, but pick Davis, California from the list. Users/JasonAller
