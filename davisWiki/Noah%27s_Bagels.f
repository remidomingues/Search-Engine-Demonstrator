Noahs Bagels, located in the Marketplace, is a neighborhood deli that serves award winning bagels, artisan breads, homestyle soups, signature sandwiches and tasty sweets. On Fridays, they also have freshly baked Challah loaves. The employees are friendly and typically comprised of college students.

The bagels here are baked fresh daily (the bagels are thrown out at endofday) Noahs will, at times, donate their dayoldbagels to charities if requested of the manager. Bagels are also madetoorder on the spot. It takes an hour to make a bagel, so allow leeway for that if requesting just out of the oven bagels for an order. On weekend mornings Noahs is usually very busy and the line extends to the door, but it moves so quickly that you are in and out quickly. One can even call in and preorder their dozen or a meal such as a sandwich or breakfast bagel so they can skip the long order line and just walk in and pay for and pick up their food at the register.

There is ample seating at Noahs. Inside is counter seating and well as the large patio outside. Many patrons sit outside to enjoy the day, read the newspaper, like the The Sacramento Bee Sac Bee, or just relax and enjoy the good food and friends. Noahs is dogs dog friendly as well. They offer bowls of water to the their furry friends and they also carry Doggie bagels, made especially with your canine in mind. The posts outside the store have metal latches to secure dog leashes for owner who wish to come inside. Everyone deserves a treat when they visit Noahs. Like every Noahs Bagels, photographs from turn of the century New York line the walls.

They have an extensive menu of toppings which includes: smoked salmon (1 oz piece of lox), turkey, ham, roast beef, pastrami, corned beef, capers, lettuce, red onion, tomatoes, sprouts, cheese, cucumbers, pickles, and many more.

They feature sweets baked daily: Blueberry muffins, Strawberry white chocolate muffins, LTO muffins, cinnamon walnut strudels, cinnamon twists, Heavenly Chocolate Chip Cookies, snickerdoodle cookies, mudslide cookies, and three flavors of coffee cakes (blueberry, applecinnamon, and chocolate chip).

Egg mits (turkey sausage, spinach and swiss, baconcheddar, plain egg, lox, or with just egg) are enormous breakfast sandwiches on a bagel of your choice. They are very filling and served all day. the egg also can be substituted for egg whites for the more healthconscientious among us. Their breakfast wrap, the Sante Fe, weighs over a pound!
They also offer soups, sandwiches, salads and pizza bagels which are incredible. They are made to order and also come with a pickle and a side of either fruit salad, chips, potato salad, or cole slaw talk about a complete meal (and very filling).



Noahs also has Catering Nosh Boxes. These are perfect for breakfast or lunch. You can get a variety of bagels and shmears, sandwiches, salads and pastries. They also deliver for a nominal fee.



They also sell a selection of coffees. (Though why one would choose to drink this coffee over Peets is beyond me.)  Users/JenKao |

My favorite is the group picture of a NY womens sport team. They just have this amused look on their faces, as if the photographer was having trouble getting them to stop laughing.  Users/JenKao )

I just went to Noahs and tried their Reuben ... yummy! SS

20060306 16:20:42 nbsp I really think that Noah’s has gone downhill in the last couple years. In the last 3 or 4 visits, I can’t think of one that has been completely accurate. The wrong creamcheese, forgetting the lox, not doing any toasting
 The staff is always friendly, but they don’t seem to receive nearly enough training, and there seems to be a high rate of turnover. I can’t count the number of different prices they’ve tried to charge us for a bagel with lox and cream cheese. They’ve recently introduced an expanded sandwich line, which seems to push the staff to their limits and create even longer lines. They have tasty bagels, but I think my fiancé and I are going to try other places for awhile, since we’re tired of being disappointed. Users/MattCzarnowski

20060306 16:30:33 nbsp Yeah Ive been disappointed by Noahs ever since they got rid of their four cheese grilled cheese bagel. Was one of the greatest sandwiches in the history of the sandwich. Users/ZacMorris

20060408 19:46:14 nbsp I love bagels!  Tony was so very helpful!   yay! Users/VeronicaVillegas.

20060420 02:10:54 nbsp This is a revelation, I didnt know that there was a Noahs in Davis. Excellent! Users/TusharRawat

20060616 12:05:16 nbsp I second the going downhill comment. When they did all their expanded sandwiches they took the smoked whitefish salad off the Menu. Le Boo. Bagels are decent, I like mine with lox creamcheese, tomato and onion. Avoid their Egg Mits They microwave the egg till its flavoless and has an awfull texture. Users/CharlesGeorge

20060928 17:23:10 nbsp Gone downhill? Wait, you hear that? Whaaaaaaaaa!!!! Oh that was the whambulence, haters. This place has tasted the same until high school, ITS BAGELS. Oh, the jalapeno salsa schmear, actually pretty yummy. Users/SteveBlais

20060928 17:24:35 nbsp Since high school, sorry Im tired stayed up late to study for a midterm. Users/SteveBlais

20061108 20:49:22 nbsp bagels are good. but if your have ever been to 52nd street bagel in so cal, its much better because theyre more flavorful Users/AnnThiNguyen
    You posted this two years ago, I realize, but still, who cares what the bagels in so cal are like seeing as they arent an option for anyone who reads this wiki.

    Hes using it as a reference just in case anyone who reads this wiki is from Southern California, such as myself. And yes, I do care, so shut your mouth, stop being such a smartass.
    Their goal wasnt to describe the quality of noahs bagels, it was to complain about bagels in Davis not being as wonderful as in So Cal. Thats not the intent of this particular wiki page. I wasnt being a smartass, i was questioning the relevance of their post. Also, shut my mouth..? wow, you really take bagel defense personally.
    Uhm, another question, I am from soCal which fifty second street do you mean? ~DP
    Wegmans Marco Polo bagels are also great.  Upstate New York and Central PA.  Wonderful.  Theres also a couple really good Jewish delis in South Florida that make really tasty ones.  Its a bitch of a morning drive from Davis, though.

20071215 17:07:17 nbsp The staff there is very friendly.  The service is quick; even when theres a line out the door, I dont wait for more than 10 minutes.
The spinach, egg and bacon panini is delicious Users/drpottsiv

20080117 21:52:35 nbsp yumm!! even the plain bagel with just plain cream cheese is awesome...never to sweet or too heavy like others... Users/SimplyIncognito

20081109 14:16:08 nbsp Noahs doesnt sell bagels, they sell bagel shaped bread.  There was a great SNR article a year ago, a blind taste test which Noahs almost unanimously lost (against local Sacramento area bagel shops).  Bagels are supposed to be boiled and then baked  dense and chewy.  Noahs differs greatly in method (not boiled! either steamed or steam treated or use steamovens or some such thing) to getem lighter and fluffier, and I think Ive read about using some sort of oil to help keepem from being dry.  Quite a difference! Im surprised no one commented about that over the years.  I ate here reasonably frequently when I lived in North and West Davis, but please people: be sure to try real bagels at other places! Im sure JW knows what Im talking about.  Users/EdWins

20090303 13:51:30 nbsp SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO I recently had a BAD customer service experience at Noahs.  READ THIS STORY AND BOYCOTT NOAHS FOR SHITTY CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

One of the employees handed me the wrong bagel, and i was holding it in my hand as I paid.  (Which is fine, ok, people make mistakes)...

When I got back to my office I noticed that it was the wrong bagel with smear i was allergic to.  So I had to go BACK to Noahs to get the RIGHT bagel, in the rain, got soaking wet, and it took about a half hour to drive back, find parking, wait for the bagel that they said would be ready when I got there but it wasnt... all the meanwhile Im on a deadline at work which has now passed... (Which is also fine, shit happens).... But all this....

...TO BE COMPLETELY INSULTED BY THE EMPLOYEE!

First, he accused me of grabbing the wrong bagel even though he HANDED it to me and saw me HOLDING the bagel while I was paying for it.  He basically called me stupid for not noticing it was not mine, even though it was in the bag already at that time (It SAID Vikki on it, not your name... not my fault!). If that wasnt RUDE ENOUGH!!!!!! he noticed my angst as I was waiting for the bagel and missing my work deadline and said dude, dont you work like, down the street? What an ass.  I NEVER make rude comments on wiki, but when it comes to treating people, especially CUSTOMERS with respect, that irks me.

I work in customer service, and you should always treat that person with at LEAST respect, if not like royalty.  GET A CLUE, NOAH EMPLOYEE! Never going there again.   Users/Squeekyclean
   Im not a big fan of Noahs either, but I think your anger is misdirected here. Boycott Noahs for shitty customer service? More like, Theres one Noahs employee who is an asshole. I know you probably wrote your comment so you could vent somewhere, but you should probably complain to the management and describe the employee or get his name. Now, if management does nothing about the problem, then you do have a valid grudge against that particular Noahs. Users/KellyM

20090304 19:11:34 nbsp No, Im upset at Noahs for not training their staff to be professional.  So, I still hold my comment to be valid.  Im very passionate about great customer service so bad service is a peeve. If Noahs does not train their staff on the importance of customer service, then they suck and people should not go there!   Users/Squeekyclean

20090606 06:58:46 nbsp I just got a bowl of chicken noodle soup and a bagel and the soup was BAD! I called them and they said I can get a refund or they would give me a fresh bowl (it wasnt even fresh, i saw them microwave it). I went back to get my refund, they didnt even apologize. NOTHING.  Users/AngelaJ

20090730 09:19:10 nbsp Ive now had two equally horrendous experiences at this joint and my wife and I both decided were never going back. Both times Ive gone, Ive had to wait 20 minutesplus for a bagel people, not a bagel with anything special  just a smear or whatever they call it. Also, both times, the person taking the order recognized someone in line behind me and made a Bline to take their order before mine. Finally, this last time, after waiting like I said for more than 20 minutes, I see a guy place an order on the counter, but not call anyones name. I assumed maybe the order wasnt finished. He was going to put more up there, or whatever, anyway, they call your name when your orders ready. This time, he placed the order on the counter, looked around sheepishly, and just walked back to do his slowpaced work. After it sat up there for five minutes getting cold, I walked up and saw that it was my order. To add insult to injury, the coffee tastes like slightly darkened water. No wonder they give you bottomless coffee. Youd have to drink an entire batch to get the buzz you get from a cup from anywhere else. I tried two different blends, thinking the first was just a fluke, and it was still horrible.

I think the only reason so many people go there is its the only breakfast joint on that end of Davis. BTW: I grew up in Philly and New York, and these things, I dont know what you call them, but bagel is a charitable word at best. More like chewybread with a hole in the middle. The only positive I give is the strawberry smear, which is delicious no doubt. I rarely leave such a negative comment but Im just so disappointed in a place that tries to come off as some New York delicatessen when they know and I know, this place has a long way to go to meet those standards.

In NYC, they know that smiling and making small talk is no substitute for good food and timely service. Users/condemned2bfree

20091009 10:00:55 nbsp I really dont get why every one is so upset with Noahs.  Its a freaking bagel chain not a three star michelin.  We dont complain about the quality of the meat at McDonalds because we know its crap and its supposed to be.  We dont cry about how bad the service is at Carls Junior because we know that they get paid nothing to do demeaning work.  I mean seriously... Im from New York and blah blah blah... They made we miss my work deadline blah blah blah... Bagels are supposed to be boiled not steamed blah... you get the point.  I guess I just want to clarify to those who are reading this and arent familiar with Noahs; ITS A CHAIN dont expect anything more than what you would get at any other corporate eatery.  If you want quality and kindness support small business.   Users/swiftling

20091119 23:38:29 nbsp Im addicted to their bagels with LOX and cream Cheese. OMG their lox is so amazing.  Users/BryceH

20091124 20:42:50 nbsp THE BEST COFFEE IN DAVIS!  I wish they would sell their Chelsea coffee beans to the public.   OHH and in regards to people saying they have bad service? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  GO TO a Chinese Restaurant and see how they treat people there.Users/JSlice

20100129 16:15:14 nbsp Taste is taste, so if youve eaten here and liked it more power to you, however if you are wondering if they make true bagels by boiling then baking them the answer is no.  You can get a nice roll with a hole at Noahs, (it tastes just like the one youd get at Safeway, BTW) but if youve had actual bagels, youll be disappointed as I was. Users/rfrazier

20100326 11:05:55 nbsp Please bring back the sundried tomatoes bagel! Apparently those are discontinued. Its the best. What happened?   Users/LeeY

20100430 16:37:43 nbsp I wouldnt know where else to get my bagels. Filling enough to make it to lunch, plain or shmeared. Users/sjpacheco

20100430 17:51:47 nbsp I agree with LeeY, I always got sundried tomato bagels there but now they are discontinued. The sundried tomato cream cheese just doesnt do it for me (if they even have that anymore). Users/JenniferCook

20100502 09:42:57 nbsp I love Noahs Veg Out sandwich but they consistently mess up my order in one form or another. Just be sure to double check your order. Users/EmmyMelton

20100509 14:28:09 nbsp Visiting Salt Lake City, I went with my sister to Einstein Bagel and was surprised to see that they have glutenfree bagels! As I am a Celiac, I decided to try one. Very, very tasty! And since Einsteins and Noahs are the same, I am wondering if anyone has spotted glutenfree bagels at this location.  Users/nataliesadler

20101108 09:45:02 nbsp I was hungry,counting on a tasty bagles...but a very bad customer service...i ask for toasted bagle and....they didnt toast my bagle and also gave me a wrong bagle...fresh tomato was miss...looool..i have paid almost $8.00 for breakfast...very young team with no experience...i am not happy....  Users/amirhero

20101117 21:19:34 nbsp I have always loved Noahs, BUT was severely disappointed to discover last week (via Nutrition Info on Noahs website) that almost all, if not 100% of their bagels, have HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP... buyers, beware!!  Im writing the company now to let them know; hoping enough people will do so and theyll offer bagels without it.   Users/lalamusic

20101230 05:07:35 nbsp Poor management. Staff is not provided the proper resources to do their jobs well, to do their jobs as is instructed by the training videos. Im under the impression that this has to do with minimizing costs. Employees are not paid well and cant really hope for raises, even after years of working there. Its a pretty terrible place to work and there are better places to spend your money in Davis... but if youre desperate for work, there really is a high turn over. Walk in with a big smile and a modest resume. If you cant speak with the manager, come back when shes there. And go back frequently. Users/Janny

20110112 10:20:53 nbsp My better half and I are regulars at Noahs. The food is usually very tasty and prepared rapidly and we do enjoy it. Today, however, we came across the first slight snag. We ordered sweet bagels (blueberry and cinnamon raisin) and, once we bit into them, we were greeted with a mouthful of onion and garlic vapor. The bagels certainly looked like blueberry and cinnamon raisin. We exchanged and the replacements (untreated  just plain) suffered the same problem. It could be that they are blindtesting a new cinnamongarliconion bagel and if so Im not a fan. I just hope they havent decided to bake sweet and savory together. Users/Mazzle

20110205 21:25:52 nbsp pumpernickle bagels with a smattering of cream cheese or jam paired with a cup of your favorite coffee will put you a bit closer toward eternal contentment.  Users/blastoff

20110514 17:12:20 nbsp It tastes good but in my opinion its too expensive. I pay like $5 for a bagel sandwich and eat it in about 2 minutes and im still hungry after. Users/rachealgalante

20110727 09:06:14 nbsp Like another poster already noted, this places uses HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP in their bagels...pretty much defeating the purpose of being a healthy alternative to traditional fast foods restaurants! Users/JohnVanderMolen

20110728 16:02:28 nbsp Maybe I dont buy bagels enough to understand the process, but I feel this is a terrible inefficient food service business. I came in to pick up a single bagel for my wife, with nothing done to it, and I had to wait in a line (expected) and then was given my bagel. I then had to wait in another line, at the other end of the store, by the same person, who just moved to the other register... While I was paying they were taking time to make the 3 people in front of me their bigger orders.... I dont really understand the double line thing? Cant I just pay at the same time I give my order? Isnt that the logical way? All I know is I had to wait over 10 minutes to get a single bagel with nothing done to it, however, I got to hold the bagel (which I didnt own yet) within the first 2 minutes?!?! From now on, Ill just have my wife get her own bagels... Hear that Noahs? Youre destroying chivalry.  Users/elliottPollard
  I havent been to Noahs in awhile, but they used to have a line for those who are only getting bagels.  Admittedly, I think that most of those people were buying a half dozen or a dozen bagels, but Im sure the same rule would apply for just one bagel.  So, either they took that line away, or you just didnt see it.   Users/CovertProfessor
   Yeah, one of the other customers in line kinda glared at me because I wasnt behind the rest of the line. So moved to the back and figured they know best, because they go there more .... Users/elliottPollard
    Nah, the sandwich people dont really understand the bagel people.  But going to a bagel store just to buy bagels is an old and proud tradition that supersedes the bagelassandwich movement.  Next time, Id just ignore the glare.  cp

20110914 06:14:12 nbsp Noahs wasnt in Davis when I went to school there but I discovered it (and Peets) when I went to grad school at Cal. I instantly loved the bagels far more than the tougher traditional bagel. After finishing up I move to SoCal and it took some time but they finally have a shop in La Jolla (actually called Einsteins Bagels, same company same product) and I love it. I remember when there was only one Noahs and one Peets coffee and people would happily stand in line at both places.  Now, as a matter of fact I serve Noahs/Einsteins bagels and Peets coffee at our weekly lab meetings and everyone is now addicted! Users/PaulWilliamDiaz

20111001 01:27:03 nbsp I think that some of the feedback posted is rather inaccurate. First, Noahs and Einsteins are not the same company. They were however started by the same person who sold Noahs and ten started Einsteins. You would think that creating one bagel business that doesnt actually make traditional bagels would be enough for anyone. Real bagels are boiled and then baked. They are super soft on the inside and a little bit chewy on the outside. They probably dont maintain there texture as long as the fake kind. If you think it doesnt matter than try microwaving your bread rather than baking it just to see how big a difference process makes. Might as well roll up wonder bread and roll it into a circle and call that a bagel or cut a round pier of cake cut a hole into it and call it a donut. Lies are lies. But if you like it then you are no different then the many who think that high fructose corn sweetener tastes. And there are upsides to having unrefined tastebuds and lower bills! Users/RudiJ

20120403 11:43:53 nbsp This place is tasty but I cant figure out their prices. Love their garlicherb spread, but why does it cost an extra $1.50 to get spread on a bagel, and why is that not noted on the menu? Also, their potato salad is delicious (I normally dont even like potato salad), but Im always charged a different amount when I get it, from $1 to $2.50. I would also recommend they get more vegetarian sandwich options. Users/MeggoWaffle

20120505 08:38:39 nbsp You know, the food doesnt taste terrible. Not worth a long line, but decent. However, my wife likes toasted bagels with cream cheese, lox, and capers, and they cant do it right. They charge for the capers, and dont put them on the bagel. This has happened 4 out of 5 times over the past yearandahalf (I learned my lesson, and babysit the employee while they make the bagel, and check it before I leave). Users/EricWecker

20121218 08:38:01 nbsp The best breakfast bagel sandwiches in Davis! I see to it that I come here whenever I come back home!! Users/EmThornhill

20140803 12:22:00 nbsp The last three times I have been to Noahs I have waited over 30 minutes for small orders. I worked at a similar bagel store for years and know what efficiency looks like. This place needs to figure out a better system. The employees are nice but much to slow and reliant on the order displays. Also, if you are going to have an order here sign then follow it. Nobody knew where to go.  Anonymous
