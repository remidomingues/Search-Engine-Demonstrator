~ This reminds me...Neil and I were on a college speach team.  Our college mascot was was the Cougar, so when the had Tshirts made, they used the cougar theme on the shirt.  It wasnt until the shirts were back from the printer that they noticed the horrible mistake on the shirts. UMM Speech: our GRRRR is worse than our Grammer.  Apparently worse than our spelling too.

20100930 16:09:07 nbsp There are motionsensing compressed air spray cans that you can set out.  When a critter (or person) walks by, theyll just let out a brief jet of air with a decently loud hissing noise.  Ive seen them used repeatedly for neighborhood cats that like to spray in peoples yards, but they might work well with the squirrels.  That said, when squirrels get really determined, theyre incredibly hard to foil. Users/TomGarberson
