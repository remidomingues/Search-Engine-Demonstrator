The Davis Polyamory/Nonmonogamy Support and Discussion Group has a mission statement to support for those in or considering polyamory or open relationships. They are hosted by the UCD Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Resource Center. Anyone in or considering any form of nonmonogamous relationship is invited to drop in. We welcome participants of all genders and sexual orientations. This group is open to all community members, affiliated with UCD or not.

Facilitators are Jezzie Fulmen and Adam Zimbardo.  For the next group meeting, check out the http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid101119383268792&vinfo FaceBook page.
