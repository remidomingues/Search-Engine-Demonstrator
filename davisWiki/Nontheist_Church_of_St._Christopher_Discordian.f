The Nontheist Church of St. Christopher Discordian doesnt have a place of worship.  But you can get the sermons of the Left Reverend Users/BarnabasTruman Barnabas Truman at the Churchs http://nontheistchurch.livejournal.com/ official website (When checked in April 2013 the last posting was from April of 2005).

The Nontheist Church believes that everyones ego is entitled to an afterlife ... except those of cabbages.  Beware the cabbages that are trying to disguise themselves as humans or beets.

Note also that Users/BrentLaabs Brent Laabs, being an orthodox Discordian, knows nothing whatsoever about the Church of St. Christopher: the above line about cabbages and so forth is nonsense.
