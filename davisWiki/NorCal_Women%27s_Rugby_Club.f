The NorCal Womens Rugby Club (formerly known as the Davis DoubleDeckers Womens Rugby Team) is a local womens rugby sports team. They welcome players from the Davis/Sacramento and surrounding areas. No experience is necessary!

Practices will start in June and will be from 6:308:30pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

For those curious as to why some women decide to play rugby, http://www.mit.edu/~perfors/rugby.htm here is a great article to read by Amy Perfors, a player on MITs Womens Rugby Team.

The Davis DoubleDeckers has now changed to NorCal Womens Rugby Club to better encompass the area of players that we draw from. If you are interested in playing for this team, please contact norcalwomensrugby@gmail.com. No experience necessary!  Users/iwatate
