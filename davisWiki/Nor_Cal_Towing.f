They Towing services tow and store your car. Lucky you if you wanted that.  Unlucky you if somebody else had your car towed. If your car is towed by them you may want to look at If Your Car is Being Towed for general advice on how to handle the situation.

Way over priced. Around $400 to get my car back 2 hours after they tow it for the Farmers Market. Users/MikeSiminitus
