  Introduction 
Norcal Rage is what Southern California Southern Californians are subjected to for visiting, going to school in, or otherwise living in Northern California.  One instance of Norcal Rage the meanspirited, feverishlypitched sermons against the practice of using the article the in conjunction with freeway names.

 Behavior explanation 

The explanations for such behavior vary, but one common observation among those who have studied the phenonemon is that Northern Californians believe that Southern Californians are going somehow to pollute, divert, steal or subvert their precious Norcal resources.  The one resource that Southern California actually wants from Northern California is water.  But some Northern Californians mistakenly believe that their way of life, culturedness, and excellent weather are sought after.

 LA Case Study 

This is not, of course, the case.  LA residents are born, live, and die without Northern Californias existence ever crossing their minds.  If asked about the rivalry, their normal reaction is confusion.  Northern Californians visiting LA are usually treated with polite bemusement, as emissaries from a distant land that many believed mythical.

 NoCal / SoCal 

Noted (nonCalifornian) author William Gibson proposed the terms NoCal and SoCal, but the former has obstinately refused to catch on.

 A Discussion 

  I would say SoCal people have an equal distaste for Northern Californians. Look at their contempt for the world hella as well as their pride in being a larger metro. Users/JamesDawe
  I dont think they have contempt for hella.  I think theyre just confused by it.  It really is a strange word that creeps into just about every grammatical position.  And I dont think SoCal is a metro area, and its not like any superiority comes from that.  Ill tell you what Southern Californians have pride in: they have great ethnic food and theres a lot of 24hour restaurants.  Invariably they really think San Francisco is cool.  In short, I dont think theres any anti NorCal sentiment whatsoever. Users/JaimeRaba
  The easiest way to find out is to ask one.  Users/JenKao P
  I actually have seen a few of my SoCal friends using hella, now. At first, I was a little sad because I could see they were using something that was kind of strange to my ears, at the time. But, then, it started to grow on me. It still feels a little weird, so I dont actually use it, but I dont hate the word hella either. I think its part of what cool and exciting about coming up north.  Users/JenKao )
  When I first came up to Davis from San Diego, it was all Bay Area and central valley kids with more hellas than you could shake a stick at. It didnt really bother me, I just thought of it as kind of strange and most definitely overused. Thats probably the only objectionable thing about it  its the most heard word in the local vocabulary. Then they started in with their heckas and it went downhill from there. They asked me what I said instead, and I replied we didnt usually say anything there at all, lest it be fuckin or super or totally radical tubularly awesome dude. I definitely think NorCal has a big chip on its shoulder about Southern California. Where does NorCal appropriate a lot of its California style from? Its definitely more preppy and more ghetto up here (more polarity  less blending), but I recognize NorCal is just as much California as Southern California. Theres a big movement to get Southern California lifestyle (surf/skate/etc.)in NorCal, but the reverse is not true. A lot less layered shirts and Abercrombie on guys in San Diego.

Jaime hit it right on the mark when he said Southern California kids invariably think San Francisco is cool. As San Diego is not a very urban place, seeing and being able to hang out somewhere like The City (sometimes at appreciably small doses) is a very cool thing indeed. I would be hard pressed to say which place I like better between San Diego and San Francisco. The NorCal rage definitely caught me by surprise, and I cant say I wasnt a little pressed to assert my Southern Californianess. The whole feud is almost entirely unknown in San Diego, I think its completely manufactured by the NorCal squads. Not to say there arent some righteous people up here, but theres always the ones who have to give you the sour experience. I have a theory that its all based on the weather. Not that seasons arent nice, but being rained out and cloudy and twenty degrees colder than your brethren (b/c thats what they are) five hundred miles to the south who get all the recognition of being Californian must sting or something. Never crossed my mind before I came up here. Whatever, I dig the locale, its a nice change of pace. You need to broaden your experiences. Ya owe it to yaself.   Users/DanielMedinaCleghorn
