Was Halal!

It was located in the South Davis Chevron gas station. Dont be fooled by the location, the food was good...Damn good.  If you walked four feet to the right, on the Chevron counter would have been some coupons.  10% off the regular menu price if you had a UCD Student ID!

Formerly known as Papas Pizza, this restaurants joint served up not only some delicious pizza, but some awesome Philly Cheese steaks, Gyros, and other Mediterranean dishes as well. And if you found some things a bit too Hot Sauce spicy for your taste, you could have cooled your taste buds with their ice cream.

It used to be the only place in Davis to serve Philly Cheesesteaks.  They served 6 or 10 Philly Cheesesteak with a choice between traditional and The Works.  Traditional came with steak, cheese, onions and mushrooms.  The Works came with above plus jalapenos and more (I cant remember).  Prices started at $4.99 6 traditional and up.  You definitely should have used a coupon and showed your student ID.

For sides, there were seasoned fries, oven baked and hot wings (16 pieces).

Monday through Thursday they had a Philly Cheesesteak lunch special.  For $5.99, you got a 6 Philly, fries and a 20 oz soda.

They accepted the Off Campus Meal Plan.

If you happen to be in Sacramento, they have yet another location: 3701 Marysville Blvd Sac, CA 95838
