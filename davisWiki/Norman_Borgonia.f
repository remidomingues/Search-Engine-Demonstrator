Norman Borgonia is a candidate for ASUCD ASUCD Senate Senate in the Winter 2012 ASUCD Election running on the SMART slate.

 Candidate Statement 

WADDUP EVERYONE! I’m Norman Borgonia and I’m running for ASUCD Senate with the SMART slate, which seeks to give a voice within ASUCD to students from all underrepresented communities on campus. I’m a third year Exercise Biology transfer student from Riverside, California. I currently serve my community as Vice President of Mga Kapatid the largest PilipinoAmerican organization on campus and as an Intern for BRIDGE: The Pilipin@ Outreach & Retention Program at the Student Recruitment & Retention Center.

Together with the SMART Slate I will work towards the following:

MORE TEXTBOOK RESERVES

We will work to save students money by creating a textbook reserve located in the new Student Community Center, supplementing the Shields Library Reserves and giving students much needed additional study space and free access to the most common GE books.

FUNDING FOR ETHNIC/LAV GRADS

Community specific graduations celebrate the achievement in higher education of students from underrepresented and marginalized communities. By granting funds to these events we seek to actively create a safe and inclusive campus environment which celebrates the diversity of our student body.

My Platforms:

MORE MICROWAVES IN THE COHO

As a student with a busy schedule, it’s very frustrating to have to wait in line to warm up my food at the microwave in the CoHo. As a Senator, I will install more microwave units around the CoHo and in the Silo. I firmly believe that every second of your day counts, and none of your time should be wasted standing in line to warm up your Cup Noodles.

CULTURAL AWARENESS & SAFE ZONE WORKSHOPS AT ORIENTATIONS

With the recent dispays of hate throughout our campus, I feel it is necessary to educate our incoming students on cultural sensitivity in order to create a campus environment where all students feel safe. As a Senator, I will implement Safe Zone and PEACE training workshops at freshman and transfer orientation in order to nurture greater cultural awareness among our incoming students and create a more inclusive space throughout our campus.

Vote NORMAN #1, SMART #26 for ASUCD Senate! Bree Rombi & Amy Martin for Exec! Thank you!
