Norman S. Matloff, Ph.D. is a Computer Science professor at UC Davis.  He obtained his Ph.D. at UC Los Angeles in 1975.

In 2011, his presentation (http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/georgetown.pdf PDF of slides) questioning the need and actual use of H1B visas for IT workers was quoted in various publications.  The presentation was quoted in http://blogs.sciencemag.org/sciencecareers/2011/03/aninternalbra.html Science Careers, a side publication of the journal Science, and also the http://blogs.sciencemag.org/sciencecareers/2011/03/aninternalbra.html Science Careers Blog.   The story appeared on http://science.slashdot.org/story/11/03/21/161211/CSProfDecriesAmericasInternalBrainDrain Slashdot.org, a popular blog devoted to News for Nerds.

If you take ECS 50 with Matloff, youll learn real assembly the entire time (x86). Other people who teach the class usually use some mixture of SPIN (an artificial architecture that is very 6502ish) and MIPS.
