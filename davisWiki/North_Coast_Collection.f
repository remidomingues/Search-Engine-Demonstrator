The North Coast Collection compliments the large redwood grove across the creek with characteristic trees of the mixed evergreen woodlands typical of Californiaâ€™s north and central coast.  An unpaved footpath winds through the aromatic California bay, Port Orford cedar, and graceful Lawson cypress trees that are intermingled in this collection with redwood trees.  The reflections of the yellow leaves of bigleaf maple and willows light up the stream corridor here in the fall.  Tall treelike specimens of the beautiful evergreen Catalina cherry anchor the east end of the collection.
