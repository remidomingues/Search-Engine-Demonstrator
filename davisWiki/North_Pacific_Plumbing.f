20111101 12:14:26 nbsp Brent recently replaced a bathtub faucet for us. It was such a simple job, he was willing to just tell us how to do it so he wouldnt have to charge us a service call. He was professional, honest, and someone who I will definitely call in the future for plumbing work. Users/mmtt

20111115 12:06:15 nbsp Brent did a variety of repairs in our bathrooms. He was great at explaining how I could do the repairs on my own should the same faucet begin dripping. He also advised me how to check to see if I could install a sink in my laundry room. I did and we can so we will be calling him back to install. He is very friendly, professional and fair! Users/Nylawiebe

20120116 10:06:40 nbsp Brent recently replaced all three of our toilets with new toilets that I had ordered online.  Brent removed the old toilets, unpacked the new ones, installed them, and carted away the old ones and all the packaging!  As previous reviews have mentioned he was friendly, honest, and professional.  I will certainly call him again for my next plumbing project or repair. Users/MBenito

20120521 14:52:07 nbsp North Pacific spent about an hour fixing a water line at my house and charged me $180.00, $20 less than originally told.  It was also almost $900 less than Same Day Service Plumbing was going to charge me.  Always get more than one contractor to estimate a job. Users/RLSalinger

20121203 17:47:18 nbsp Brent replaced a valve in our hot water boiler recently  charged less than he quoted too! Very efficient and professional, would highly recommend. Users/LizA25

20121213 15:27:16 nbsp Why does plumbing always go out on a weekend? We stopped getting hot water. Brrrr. I called a number of plumbers Sunday, and Brent was nice enough to call back and say he didnt have an opening until the end of the week. After calling a number of others and no luck for a day, and skipping ones that got bad reviews, I called back Brent! He was super about calling back, and could fit us in the next day too! After having worked with Plumber MD before, always feeling I was paying too much and buying into a program that was nothing but a money sink and no actualized benefit, Brent was a refreshing and welcome change! He has the honesty and integrity that one hopes to find in a small business and he fixed up our water heater right up. Hell be the first Ill call next time I have any plumbing needs!
