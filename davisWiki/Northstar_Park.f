Northstar is a great place to running run, Inline skating inline skate, or visit on a Bicycling bike trip through the Northstar Greenbelt greenbelt. It appears that the citys open container ordinance does not apply to this parks park.

A large pond at the eastern edge of the park is a great place to play frisbee and goof around, but be careful you arent attacked by the crazy domestic Chinese geese that live in the water! They poop a lot, so walk barefoot at your own risk. The pond is lined with yellowflowering iris (Iris pseudacorus) which are very pretty, but this species is an invasive species that really should not be used here. Observant and quiet explorers are likely to see Grebes piedbilled grebes, American Coot coots, Ducks mallard ducks, Canada geese, and the usual set of birds that live in town.  But on the whole, the Birds and Bird Watching bird watching at the pond is mostly a matter of watching to make sure you dont get the Chinese geese mad at you! Far better bird watching is at the fencedin North Area Pond at the eastern boundary of Northstar park, where there are two wooden observation docks that extend into the preserve.  Theres also a small Northstar Nature Trail with informational signs about  the area and its town wildlife wildlife.  Down the greenbelt is the Northstar Pocket Park, which has a play structure for children and a bbq.
