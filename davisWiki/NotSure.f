NotSure, kinda maybe.


20080916    Dear NotSure,
After reading the comment you left on the DavisWiki page of the Floor Store of Davis, we as a business are left in confusion. We have no record of a customer, or a job fitting the description you left, and we keep very careful records at our store. Please write back and let us know more specifics so we can get to the bottom of it, or at least verify that you have written about the correct business. Many people confuse us with Floors to Go, and we want to be sure that if we are going to be negatively reviewed, that at least we arent being blamed for someone elses sloppiness.   We would much appreciate a speedy and direct response. Thank you for your time and consideration.   The Floor Store of Davis/Users/AnnaLyasota Anna Lyasota, owner

We recently had a dog not wanting to eat while it had a medical cone on its head, after having an injury, and I personally sat down with the dog and hand few her so she would eat all her food. its hard enough to eat with the cone, but definatley i can understand being in so much pain, some comfort makes all the difference in the world.
