NotTires has left the building.  Not full graduated, I am also fully not in Davis.  I will rarely be checking this site, although might see your comment eventually.  I have moved on to another, distressingly smaller wikispot.

NotTires is a graduate students graduate student who will remain anonymous except to those who already suspect who he is!   This is partially because he might be your Teaching Assistants TA one day (and already was the TA for one major wikiuser that everyone has heard from).  He will eventually notice comments left here and respond, especially about Town Flora and Town Wildlife, the Climate Change environment, biodiesel biofuels, and Live Theater.  He is Judaism Jewish, in case you are curious, and happy to answer questions about religion, since talking is good.  Frequently seen in the outskirts driving around looking for plants for his research, he loves sharing his opinions, whether asked or not.   of course, everyone here does or we wouldnt edit a wiki, but I admit it up front.

p.s. NotTires is a pun on his name



Here is the comments section, in case anyone actually bothers to read this:


20080621 10:27:50 nbsp Hey... theres no template for departed businesses.  You just put {{{Include(Departed Business)}}} at the top of the entry.  Its just a notice to let people know when they are reading the entry.  Users/JabberWokky

20080826 01:53:28 nbsp Someone had actually posted that on my page at one point.  And it is true.  I am indeed not a pipe.  There is, however, a puzzle embedded into the items that Im listed as not being one of.  Figure out why I chose those particular items, and you solve the puzzle.  :) Users/IDoNotExist

20081113 05:41:33 nbsp Re: Your edit to Recycling: You dont have to refer to the other editor as commentor... you are both full editors and can write your positions as content, not as dialog. In other words, they stated your position, and you can state your position with equal footing (and give them the same footing).  Thus the entry starts to reflect the myriad of different viewpoints within the actual community of Davis. Users/JabberWokky

20081127 17:10:06 nbsp I will guess that your name is Jim. Users/ThanhVu
