20060302 20:46:39 nbsp Ok. Ive come across somebody who I believe is a local author, but Im not quire sure on his real name, I only know that people call him Butch. Hes probably in his 50s and he tends to hang out at a lot of cafes in North Davis and a lot of students seem to know him. I overheard someone saying that he writes books that have stories about the people he meets. Does anybody know anything about this guy? Users/AbbyLawson

20061128 17:10:36 nbsp You could be talking about Mr Bruce? Users/StevenDaubert

20061129 16:53:09 nbsp What about Assc. professor Emily Albu? Shes written a couple books and lives in Davis. Users/MyaBrn

20090315 20:43:54 nbsp Ugh. Books should be italicized, not in quote marks.  Somebody should fix this. Users/CovertProfessor
  Are you trying to send me notsosubliminal messages? Users/MaryLieth
   Nope, unless you think you could do it relatively easily... unfortunately, a global find and replace wouldnt work.   Users/CovertProfessor
  Arent books supposed to be underlined? Or is that a grade school lie?  Users/ElleWeber
   Underlining is acceptable, but its a bit oldfashioned (though you will still see it on occasion).  Underlining was what people did when italicizing was not readily available.   Users/CovertProfessor
   When I write up press release info for author signings, I have always italicized. Users/SunjeetBaadkar
