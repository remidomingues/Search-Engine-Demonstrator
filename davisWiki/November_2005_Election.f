20051030 18:47:44 nbsp I just got my absentee ballot (registered in Davis) and I dont see anything about the County Board of Education. Users/KenjiYamada
  Area 2 is Davis, so I dont know why its not on my sample ballot either.  Users/AndrewChen

20051030 18:51:36 nbsp I think the County Board of Education election is only for certain districts. Also, I am going to be working for the Yolo County  Elections Office at the Precinct 59 polling place, Puntillos Garage. Is anybody else on the wiki working in the election? Users/NickSchmalenberger

20051107 00:36:10 nbsp Random question, does anyone know if any election night parties are going to take place? Users/LizethCazares
