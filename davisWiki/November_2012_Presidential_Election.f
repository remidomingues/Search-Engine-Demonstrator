The November 2012 Presidential Election occured on Tuesday the 6th. President Barack Obama of the Democratic Party and challenger Mitt Romney of the Republican Party were the two leading candidates, and President Obama won. As usual, an assortment of controversial propositions also shared the ballot space.

This was the first election in which Californians could http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/elections_vr.htm register to vote online  you had to register by October 22, 2012 to vote in this election. You could also check your http://www.yoloelections.org/regdb/ voter registration status and http://www.yoloelections.org/voting/polling_place polling place online, which is a good thing to do since polling places may have changed since the last time you voted. If you had chosen to vote by mail, you could also turn your mailin ballot in at any polling place in your county on Election Day or at the elections office in your county.

This is also the first election in which Davis had been assigned to the new districts that came about as a result of the passage of Proposition 11 in 2008. This had had an impact on the eligibility of some candidates. Perhaps most notably, Mike Thompson  could no longer run for reelection in our district, whereas John Garamendi could.

Measure E, Prop. 30, and Garamendi all won handily.  Oh, and Barack Obama.  Props. 32, 34, and 37 were rejected.  Apparently, Californians like schools, unions, GMOs, and governmentsponsored deaths.  78.8 percent of Davis residents cast a ballot this election, the highest percentage for any community in Yolo County.
