Novozymes, Inc. is the Research and Development research and development arm in the USA of the Danish company Novozymes A/S.  Novozymes is the biotechbased world leader in industrial enzymes and microorganisms. In 2000, Novozymes won a $14.8 million grant from the DOE through the National Renewable Energy Laboratory http://www.nrel.gov/ NREL to reduce the enzyme cost of corn stover conversion into fermentable sugars for ethanol production. At the end of the three year grant Novozymes scientists were able to reduce the cost of the enzyme to $0.27 per gallon of ethanol and were awarded a oneyear extension and $2.3 million to reduce the cost even further. To date they have achieved a 30 fold total reduction in enzyme cost (http://www.eere.energy.gov/news/archive.cfm/pubDate%7Bd%2020050420%7D#9004 link) and continue to work in further improvements and new substrates.

Novozymes, Inc. maintains a very close relationship with all the area schools and provide special tours for groups of students and educators. They also have a very interesting internships internship program in the fields of molecular biology, protein chemistry, fermentation technology and microbial physiology.
