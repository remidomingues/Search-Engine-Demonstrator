20100129 nbsp Howdy Nikhil, and welcome to the wiki.  My names Evan, pleased to meet you.  Sorry it took so long to get things straightened out (first CampusCred is mistaken for a spammer, and then ASUCD politics pop up!), but regardless, your contributions are sincerely appreciated and I wish you the best of luck with CampusCred and hope you continue to add your voice to the wiki.  Once again, welcome to the wiki!   Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20110131 18:45:23 nbsp Thanks Evan. No worries. Regulating the wiki well is what ensures it has good, quality posts. I did just post on the talk page and want to get the contents of our page changed/modified a little bit. Thanks! Users/Nsheel

20110131 19:13:21 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki!  Sorry about the rough start here.  You folks got a bit of a kneejerk reaction due to (Im guessing) a combination of the frequency of spam on here and the apparent procedural mistake by Mark which got William so fired up.  If you havent read it already, Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner is a very worthwhile read.  Itll highlight some of what to expect on here.  You and your colleagues have been extremely civil, from what Ive seen, and I hope the confusion all gets sorted out quickly.  Best of luck with your new business.  Users/TomGarberson


20110428 00:27:55 nbsp Howdy! I reverted your edit because that info was added by another user and gave a pretty common viewpoint. Users/JoePomidor

20110429 12:18:34 nbsp There is no comment section or talk section.  Opinions and even jokes are happily inserted all over the place.  The wiki is openly written and reflects a multitude of views.  The comment macro is merely a convenience for people: ideally, they add their commentary directly to the main body. Users/JabberWokky
