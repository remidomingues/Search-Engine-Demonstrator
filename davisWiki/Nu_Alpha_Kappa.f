                      Celebrating 15 years of Brotherhood at UC Davis                         






Nu Alpha Kappa (ΝΑΚ), is a Latinobased Fraternities fraternity which encompasses and values all cultures. Nu Alpha Kappa stands as one of the largest Latinobased fraternities on the west coast.

Often referred to as NAK, Nu Alpha Kappa was founded on February 26, 1988 on the campus of California Polytechnic State University, becoming the first Latinobased fraternity at that campus. Currently, NAK is composed of twentyfour established chapters across California, Nevada, and Colorado. Nu Alpha Kappa was a charter member of the National Association of Latino Fraternal Organizations (NALFO), but is now a member of the NorthAmerican Interfraternity Conference.


 National History 

Xinaco, a Nahuatl word used by the Olmecs, describes an educated, amiable individual whose personality and charisma transcends and enlightens all cultures and social classes. The Xinacos (CHINaKos) meeting resulted in the creation of a new fraternity. The dynasty began with an invitation to a meeting that took place on February 26, 1988. Fifteen good friends, the socalled Nacos, which is a Spanish slang word for someone who gets along well with everyone, would mark the beginning of a better social environment at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo.

The Nacos got together to express their ideas and to demonstrate that they were part of Cal Poly. They were enthusiastic about starting a club to help Hispanic students overcome the culture shock experienced when arriving at a predominantly Anglo University. As time went by, each member began to see the excitement the other members began to develop towards the club. They decided to seek fraternity status.

The Nacos knew that this process would take a lot of time and effort. Unfortunately, four members were unable to hold this commitment and decided to drop out. The remaining eleven members decided to go forward and adopt the word Naco to the Greek fraternity system. Later, the Nacos would be known and identified as NU ALPHA KAPPA, or NAKS for short. Although NAK chose to integrate into a Greek system, they also decided to focus on brotherhood and unity through a commitment to maintain their Latino culture.

Being the first Latino fraternity in the history of the university put pressure on every member of NAK, especially since there had been attempts in the past to start a fraternity and failed. Therefore to make this attempt succeed, NAK concluded that their goals would be as follows:

    We, NU ALPHA KAPPA, seek to unite and involve all students in a more harmonious and brotherly atmosphere through academic, social and cultural means. There is a need to interface the various backgrounds that constitute the student body of Cal Poly in order to improve relations amongst all students and the community in San Luis Obispo.

 KAPPAisa Chapter @ University of California, Davis 

The origins of Nu Alpha Kappa Fraternity, Inc. Kappa Chapter lay in the fall quarter of 1995 at the University of California at Davis. Roberto Felix, Raul Lopez, Jason Francis, Juan Alderete, Sigifredo Juarez, and Alex Gonzalez, met and became friends in Casa Cuahtemoc, a theme house that promotes the Chicano/Latino Culture in the Tercero Housing Area. As the quarter progressed, this group of young men along with Ivan Chaidez a friend living out side of CASA started looking to the Chicano/Latino organizations on campus so that they could help give back to the community. However, after reviewing their options and considering whether or not to join an organization, they felt that they had not found an organization that fit their needs.

This group of young men was different from everyone else and they were looking for something different, they were searching for an organization that stood for academic excellence, an organization that strive for community involvement, but at the same time offered social interaction. This was when the first discussions about starting a new organization, and more specially a fraternity, started to sprout up amongst the group. Thus, this core of young men embarked on a task to find an organization that fit the mold and that embodied the ideals of cultura, carnalismo, y educacion.

These young men learned of Nu Alpha Kappa Fraternity, Inc. through family members in the organization. Ivan and Sigifredo both had cousins that were a part of NAK. From these family members, the group was given a good idea of what NAK represented and furthermore, the young men felt that NAK offered a great opportunity to join something that represented and encompassed their ideals of cultura, carnalismo, y educacion.

The following year, the seven men resumed discussion about chartering a chapter of Nu Alpha Kappa Fraternity, Inc. Now however, Manuel Vasquez and Luis Mora joined the group. Before they knew it, they were taking the necessary steps to become a part of the NAK familia. Upon meeting the brothers of Nu Alpha Kappa and learning more about the organization, they felt that they were ready to begin the process of chartering a chapter of NAK.

First however, they became an official organization on campus. So on January 27, 1997, the gentlemen met for their first official meeting. This group of men came to be known as Ollin (Nahautl for movement) Raza Avanzando La Educacion or better known as O.R.A.L.E. On February 4, 1997 O.R.A.L.E became a recognized student organization by the University of California at Davis. Soon there after, O.R.A.L.E. began to get involved in the community and strive to become more visible on campus, whether through community service events or fundraisers, the group was showing the enthusiasm that had lead them to becoming an interest group.

They began to mature as an organization and learned how to effectively run an organization. From the financial responsibilities to the social and educational aspects of school life, they learned how to balance the two and quickly became recognized as one of the leading organizations on the Davis campus. Soon thereafter, the Chicano/Latino community started noticing the work and dedication of this new organization. At this time, in the middle of winter quarter, was when O.R.A.L.E. admitted it last two members, Omar Peña and Eduardo Rivera.

In Spring Quarter of 1997 O.R.A.L.E. was given a chance to be heard by the National Board of Nu Alpha Kappa Fraternity, Inc. At a National Meeting in San Diego, the group presented their progress as an organization and expressed its interest in becoming a chapter of NAK. The group was accepted; so on April 12, 1997 O.R.A.L.E. became the official KAPPA CHAPTER PROSPECTS of Nu Alpha Kappa Fraternity, Inc. The group had now embarked on a journey that would take unbelievable dedication and heart. After seven months and eighteen days O.R.A.L.E at UC Davis became the Kappa Chapter of Nu Alpha Kappa Fraternity, Inc. Setting standards on campus and winning the Best New Organization on Campus Award along the way.
