Nutella (pronounced newtelluh) is a sweet spread made with hazelnut, chocolate, and skim milk. Its maker also makes the famous Ferrero Rocher chocolates.

Its used most commonly as a spread on crepes or Breads bread. Its also sold in little packets that come with tiny spatulas, common snacks among school children in Europe or some parts of Asia. Nutella is the most popular spread on the European table, and has more than 4 million Facebook fans.
