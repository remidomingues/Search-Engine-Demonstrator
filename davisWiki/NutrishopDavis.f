Please be aware this user page is really meant for personal information. I created a business page for you called Nutrishop Davis.  Users/PeteB

20130228 19:52:27 nbsp And the page was edited to conform to wiki guidelines for forprofit organizations and other wiki norms.  See Welcome to the wiki/Business Owner for more details. Users/CovertProfessor

20130325 22:51:39 nbsp You seem to think this is a business listing site.  It isnt.  These pages are for the community and are not yours to delete.  I am also not terribly inclined to help someone who has lied twice (once by pretending to be a customer and once by denying that the new fake account was using the same computer as the old one).

Youd be better off to respond to the accusation on the page, and perhaps change your ways if the accusation is accurate.  I recommend reading that welcome to the wiki page I linked to above once again. Users/CovertProfessor

20130325 22:54:22 nbsp Also, its very interesting to hear what you think about the people of Davis: We have a lot of these tree hugging people in Davis that think they are so high and mighty yet they shop in corporate stores like the nugget, whole foods and trader joes.  These are the people you want to shop in your store?  With that attitude? Users/CovertProfessor

20130326 11:59:46 nbsp You cannot delete the page. It is not technically your page. It now belongs to the community. I would suggest working with the Wiki/Davis community instead of posting things that will antagonize people. Users/PeteB
