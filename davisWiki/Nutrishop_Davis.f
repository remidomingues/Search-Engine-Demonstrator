Nutrishop Davis is a locally owned and operated sports Gyms & Fitness nutrition and weight loss product store, part of a nationwide retail chain.  The owners have another store in Vacaville.  All of the Nutrishop Davis employees are Nutrition Certified Nutritionists, wiki:wikipedia:Nutritionist which is a title that is loosely regulated, unlike dietitian. But then again, just because something is regulated by government does not mean its good for you. They offer personalized meal plans free of charge, geared to your health and fitness goals.

Theres a large selection of all the top brands and the supplements have guaranteed lowest prices.  Nutrishop Davis claims to beat any competitors prices, including the Computer and Internet internet.  They have good prices on some good stuff per a friend of mine ~SD

20130326 15:44:53 nbsp I stopped by today for some power bars and wow I was impressed! They did not have the brand I usually buy (no one carries them anymore)although they had a similar brand that I had not tried before. Brandon was very helpful. He took the time to really make sure It fit into my personal regimen.
Thanks Brandon!...Sherri Users/ashleyinthemist
