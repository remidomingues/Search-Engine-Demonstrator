Nutritional Yeast is flakey, yeasty like substance that is quite tasty and very good for you. If you ever visit the On Campus Coops, J Street Coop or any other community housing, you will probably find a bunch of Hoopies sitting around a table pouring this stuff onto anything and everything. It is especially delicious on Popcorn popcorn.

It is available in bulk from the the Davis Food CoOp & Nugget and is pretty Cheap Food cheap.

The most important part about Nutritional Yeast is its, well, nutritional properties.
