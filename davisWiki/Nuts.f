Nuts is a comic that runs in The California Aggie.

It is about the squirrels on the quad, and how they scavenge from humans and fight with ducks.

 Reviews 

If you find that premise itself incredibly hilarious, you may enjoy one or two Nuts strips. Otherwise, you will likely find it a terrifying, gaping black hole of anticomedy. Avoid reading it because it will probably make you and everyone youve ever known or loved Users/KenBloom unfunny for the rest of the day.

At least its better than Scribbles
