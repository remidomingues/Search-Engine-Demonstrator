The Nyan Cat Bike lived a short life during the Spring of 2011 after nixing its spare lives in a deal with the devil. It was created by a few members of AggieTV as a screwball method to promote their  LipDub. An accompanying beach cruiser equipped with a speaker shrilled out the anthem along side the Nyan Cat Bike as it made laps around the quad. It is rumored that shaky DSLR footage exists of the bike in action, but no clear evidence has surfaced.
