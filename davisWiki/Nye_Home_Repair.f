20111014 16:31:00 nbsp Ben is awesome and very trustworthy. He returned phone calls real fast. He has great rates and if an emergency repair needs to be made on the weekend he is available. He came one day, I needed a few more materials and got them the next day (for a hanging ceiling fan), called him and he came the following day! I will definitely use his services again!! Users/NLC

20120125 12:27:32 nbsp Ben helped me fix some dry rot on house. He was very knowledgeable, prompt, and friendly. He took care of the dry rot and even painted everything to match. I would recommend Ben for your handyman needs. Users/VinhBoy

The question was asked if Nye Home Repair works outside of Davis, and the answer is no, there is no need to.  In order to be responsive, he chooses to just do work for Davis residents.

20120504 22:16:40 nbsp Ben gave us a fair written estimate right away, did good work and was very friendly. He worked with our schedule and was just an honest and nice person. He was able to handle a variety of repairs: siding and fascia (dry rot), replacing an interior garage door, and a few other home maintenance items we needed to do to sell our home. Very pleased and would definitely hire Ben again. Thanks Ben! Users/AdrienneW

20120816 11:16:26 nbsp Ben is the most professional contractor I have ever worked with.  He is friendly, trustworthy, reliable, and punctual.  The quality of Bens work is priceless.  Every repair he has done for us is still working great.  For instance, Ben has installed a new shower, replaced a door, and fixed the kitchen sink for us.  After thoroughly researching other contractors prices, I have found that Bens rates are affordable and fair.  I would not look elsewhere for future home repairs because Ben has been a pleasure to work with.  I highly recommend him.     Users/LawrenceTruong

20130130 11:30:22 nbsp We had Ben come and patch, repair, and texture places on our walls.  Ben was easy to communicate with  both inperson and via email.  His work was wonderful and matched our existing textures perfectly.  Most of all, though, I appreciated how comfortable I felt with him in my house.  Many thanks for the professional work.

20130525 22:14:24 nbsp I called around for a few quotes to install an outside flood light and run an electrical line.
Ben had the best price and offered a lower one if i decided to get the permit from the city of Davis myself.
He came in and did a fantastic job and even offered to look at a few other things i needed taken care of around my house. Friendly guy, Grade A service and work. I am definitely having Ben take care of any work that i can not handle.  A+    Users/AdamPeterson

20130725 11:02:01 nbsp Ben did some work at my parents duplex fixing a counter that the previous tenants had wrecked. He did a great job and was reasonably priced. I will call him in the future for any home repair needs that we have.  Users/JessicaSpiropoulos

20131016 15:11:28 nbsp I called Ben to replace a dining room fixture and a foyer light (2 stories up). He did a great job giving me an estimate as to the time it would take to do the job. He arrived promptly and finished promptly. Not only do the lights look great, he handled donating the old fixtures to Habitat for Humanity. I would not hesitate to call Ben again. Thank you Ben.

20140313 18:55:22 nbsp I cant praise Bens work enough. We initially had Ben come out to wire and install couple of ceiling fans, and he has since become our goto guy for a handful of things. He has also installed a dog door, repaired/retextured walls, and he was a huge help in fixing a longterm shower issue (with the help of GW Plumbing, whom I also highly recommend). Simply based on meeting him for the initial ceiling fan installation I recommended him to my mother, who ended up hiring Ben for a whole kitchen remodel (it looks AMAZING!). Hes friendly, professional, and he does excellent work. Also, the Davis inspectors know and trust his work, which says a lot.  Users/HAndrews
