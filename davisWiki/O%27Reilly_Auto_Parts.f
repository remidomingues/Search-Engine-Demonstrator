The local OReilly Auto Parts store is #3218. It was formerly Kragen Auto Parts #1775. Catering to motorists, they dont have bicycling bike racks. However, they should. What if your car breaks down and your only hope of getting parts to fix it is by riding your bike to the store?

Kragen was bought by OReilly Auto Parts. The stores were renamed to OReilly by Summer of 2011. Nasdaq Stock Symbol: ORLY (YA RLY).

OReilly has continued the Kragen practice of having regular retail and commercial accounts.  Sometimes with a sale, purchasing as a regular customer can cost less than as a commercial customer.  The other auto parts store in Davis, Napa Auto Parts, also has regular retail and commercial accounts.  While Napa prides itself in having better quality parts (generally for a higher price) its at least not always true about the quality difference.

For people who change their own oil and filter OReilly accepts used motor oil that is not contaminated by water.  They dont accept used oil filters.  Perhaps Jiffy Lube will accept them;  theyre less than one block away at 1625 Research Park Drive.

There are other auto parts stores, mostly in Woodland, but also in the other surrounding communities of Winters, Dixon and West Sacramento.

I love how the autorelated pages barely exist, and have minimal content, and the bicyclerelated pages are long, detailed, and many. Users/SteveDavison < he loves it until he needs a ride outoftown ;)

            He probably just stays sequestered in Davis like the rest of the Davisites. Living in his own little world...
             Davis is little?
              Yes.  Autorelated pages do have trouble  Bike fanatics?

I went to this place yesterday to get a new battery, and the people were really, really helpful. Im kind of carinept so I appreciated it a great deal. They tried to upsell me on a battery I couldnt afford. I almost bought it out of appreciation. The guy who sold me the battery told me that he can beat any locals price by 5%, so anyone planning on stopping by, keep that in mind. SS

20070416 14:35:45 nbsp I went there on saturday when it was raining because my windshield wiper fell off even though it was almost new. The guy who helped me replaced it for free because he said the broken one was defective. Thanks! Users/MyaBrn

20070524 16:02:12 nbsp I needed a brake booster for my car and when I called they told me they beat other people prices by 5%. I told them a lower price I have found and the lady gave me 5% discount over my lower price. I was very pleased to have a cheaper price in Davis and not have to drive to Woodland.  Users/Asgar

20070827 13:55:17 nbsp I went there to get a new light bulb for one of my headlights the other day and decided to selfhelp myself because all the other employess were busy with other customers. But then when i tried installing it i my car it wouldnt fit. So, I took it back there and told them that it wouldnt fit. And the guy totally just installed it for me, for free! Turns out i was trying to put it in the hibeam instead of lobeam. Ugh I felt so stupid. But theyre so nice and friendly! Users/shawtee

20071013 13:10:27 nbsp This place is great. My alternator died, and with the last bit of battery juice I had left, my boyfriend and I drove here to get a new one. They tested it for me to confirm that it was the alternator that was giving me problems. They have an extensive collection of tools available for customers to use, so we spent about an hour there replacing the alternator. They even helped a little when we had to use some fancy highpowered tool to remove some pulley or something. Excellent customer service, excellent prices (I compared to NAPA online before I went.) Users/EvoDiva

20071102 22:09:57 nbsp I was just there last week helping a friend with a battery problem.  The staff, as always, was professional and yet entertaining at the same time.  They tested the battery, gave us advice and got us out of the store in record time.  While they did recommend a higherpriced battery with a longer warranty, we felt no pressure to buy it, and chose a slightly cheaper one.  Shopping at this store has always been a great experience for me. Users/incognitoTA

20080115 17:48:10 nbsp Im done with going to Kragen  Every time Ive gone there Ive gotten subpar service with unknowledgeable people working there Napa is much better.  My last experience there was trying to get my alternator tested.  First time I went nobody knew how to work the machine, next time I went they couldnt find my alternator in the computer and therefore couldnt test it.  I drive a Corolla and they couldnt find it in their computer.  Give me a freakin break Toyota has made over 30 million of these and it wasnt in their system. Users/ScottStanley

20080215 17:22:38 nbsp Awesome people. They offered me a 10% phone order discount just for calling to check if they had my battery in stock. The person there was nice enough to remove my old battery and install a new one and I didnt have to do anything! Highly recommend them over the rude dudes over at Napa. Users/KarthikRam

20080528 11:09:21 nbsp I dont know who has been helping everyone else, but I had a terrible experience with the staff.  Nika was rude and totally incompetent.  Avoid her if you need anything other than someone to ring you up. Users/nmspotswood

20090210 19:41:35 nbsp Kragen needs more employee like Morgan. She so helpfull with customers. Users/vlam

20090212 16:11:06 nbsp Nika, she knows what shes taliking about. I dont know waht nmspotswood problem is. Users/khangdefoo

20090819 16:40:28 nbsp I highly recommend this place if youre looking for great service.  This one Asian guy and Hispanic dude who says dude a lot were especially helpful. Users/MikeHubby

20090908 16:36:57 nbsp All the employees there are extremely helpful. I would say that this establishment has among the best customer service in Davis as a whole. Users/IdealParadigm

20091130 16:52:19 nbsp They have a policy that you cannot order a part over the phone, which really sucks if your car is inoperable and you are 5 miles (one way) from their store. Takes about an hour to get there and back just to order that part and I have to make a return trip to pick it up, too. Ugh.  Users/DanaMace

20100129 16:54:08 nbsp I did the EXACT same thing as shawtee above (except I told the staff that I thought my fuse wasnt working), and the maintenance staffer came out and popped the light bulb in, no problem  and for free, too. The bulb cost me 12 bucks, and I didnt have to pay anything at a repair shop like I was originally going to. Very, very happy that I stopped by Kragen. Users/JoeyChen

20100731 11:45:17 nbsp I was kind of frustrated, because I showed up to Kragen at 8:02 with my dead car battery in hand (literally), and they apparently close at 8. I understand that the posted hours are the posted hours, but on the same token I made eye contact with an employee, showed him the battery, and he basically shrugged me off. Kind of poor customer service, there was nobody else in the parking lot, they could have let me in real quick to buy a battery. Guess Ill take my money to Costco and pick up a battery.  Users/JamesKrause

20110309 03:22:54 nbsp Every employee who works at this Kragen knows what they are doing. Its the way the employees carry this knowledge that makes this place special, though. Going to an auto parts store can be intimidating if youre carinept, but time and time again Ive seen the employees here go above and beyond to be helpful to their customers. They even install some parts for free! The auto parts database they use is extensive to say the least, obscure parts can be ordered at the counter at very competitive prices. They also carry a ton of fun stuff in the store, from wiper blades to license plate covers, and from sun shades to tire dressing. The hours here are also great, and the cleaning and upholstery products they sell are high quality.  Users/IanBurau

20110427 09:36:25 nbsp i went in randomly one day and asked if one of the guys could fix my seatbelt (it was flipped and it wouldnt retract itself) and he did! the staff is really nice and helpful. Users/imronhajiahmad

20120105 12:58:12 nbsp For people who change their own oil and filter, it should be known that if the bin of oil filters at Kragen (OReilly) is full, that the Jiffy Lube not one block away (1625 Research Park Drive) will probably take and recycle your used filter. Users/DavidBarnum

20120703 08:35:16 nbsp Awesome service.  Was in a hurry one morning to buy some jumper cables as my battery had died.  Arrived about 10 minutes before they opened (wasnt aware of their hours) and the manager opened up for me, quickly retrieved the needed cables and rang me out  all before they were officially due to open the doors.  Great customer service!!!! Users/browneyedblues

20131027 11:56:48 nbsp Would be nice if when they look up the part you need in their system they would give you the correct one. I was done disassembling the parts on my car to get to the broken piece only to find out that I had been sold the wrong part, needing to reassemble everything and driving 2 miles back to the store in order to get the correct one. Users/WhyTheFace

20140618 18:56:07 nbsp Not happy with my experience here. Had Brandon, the manager, change a battery out of my girlfriends car. After installation of the battery, the car was idling wrong, electronics would not work. Brandon told me I had a bad alternator, could still be the case. I did my own research, and if these new cars with computers dont get power when replacing the battery the ECU gets reset. This controls fuel mixture, timings, and my engine did not start up and was extremely startling. The car learns this information over time, and also contributes to the cars efficiency. My car is now less efficient until the ECU relearns what it needs to. Brandon did not even offer this as a solution, simply that my alternator was bad, without testing the alternator in any way, when I have had zero battery or electrical related issues. We simply replaced this battery because we have been doing maintenance on the vehicle. Brandon did not properly replace this battery. It caused me unnecessary stress and frustration.
