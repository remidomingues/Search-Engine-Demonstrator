20110215 22:19:02 nbsp Sutter is a wonderful group to have care with. They are very forward thinking, conscious of emotional, physical, mental differences between patients, and especially in OBGYN conduct business in a way which helps to make you feel more comfortable. I love the Davis Sutter GYNOs because they dont push specific contraceptives or birth control on you like other places sometimes do, and they talk a lot with you to keep you involved in your own medical care.
I have had only positive experience with this practice. :) Users/AshleyMatson
