 Signup (was) 
      Users/SunjeetBaadkar will bring hot dogs and buns (also for hamburger) and other randomness...maybe some homemade cookies if I wake up early enough to do that.  Oh, and Ill try to bring ice and/or soda.  Time to find that ice cooler...
      Users/ChrisLambertus offers to man the grill, and will bring charcoal, fire, plates, sporks, meat, beer, and a cooler with ice. Send me a message if you want me to bring anything from costco.
      Users/StevenDaubert is always down for a good bbq!
      Users/IDoNotExist may or may not exist at the BBQ, and will likely bring objects to eat off of and eat with.  Update: Whoops.  I probably will not exist there after all, due to an unscheduled scheduling conflict with a conflicting schedule.
       Users/MaryLieth will bring something fruit/vegetablerelated & ketchup & mustard
      Users/ChristopherMcKenzie will bring that damn curry everyone loves, even though he hasnt made it since the last one.  Hell think about bringing other stuff too.
      Users/JessicaLuedtke will bring something edible. Hopefully.
      Users/CurlyGirl26 will bring chicken salad and perhaps a fruit salad if she can get her act together.  Shell definetly bring beer.  Drop her a line if you have a preference.
      Users/JonathanLawton will bring Users/StephanieStudebaker and some Xburger meatX, tomato, onion, and lettuce
      Users/Aaron.Curtin will bring marinated short ribs and a big appetite (Princess will come too, kids will be at Grandmas) Cant stay too long though, have to finish moving into the new APEX Cycles shop.
      Users/Pxlated pxl will bike over after the bike church work party. (wasnt that on saturday?)
      Users/WilliamLewis will bring Users/DavidPoole, Users/StewartShearer, and Users/BrentLaabs. Also, a BBQ and some sort of deli item.
      Users/BradBenedict, Users/CharlotteHoar and Penny The Dog will most likely show up.  With hot dogs.  Other than Penny.
      Users/Sankofa416 will bring friends and snacktype foods.

>Remember to bring in your nonwiki friends to the wiki gatherings; we dont wanna seem like a cult gathering, after all.<

Zogm way to soon {{{__}}}  or so people tell me...
I think I would be down, Im always down for some BBQ   Users/StevenDaubert

20080306 02:08:50 nbsp Mid to late Octoberish? Users/JabberWokky

20080619 22:02:31 nbsp How about one in the nearish future?

(Suggest picking a name for this page that is easier to find.  I had no idea where to find the BBQ / picnic page.  (For some strange reason, I looked under...picnic.) Users/IDoNotExist

 It is linked to from Wiki Gatherings.  Maybe we should redirect picnic to that page? users/JonathanLawton

20080625 22:14:43 nbsp on the 4th? Users/StevenDaubert

20080625 22:39:50 nbsp It is possible that I might cause myself to exist briefly for such an event.  Although, it might be better to have it on a day where most people do not have alternate events or commitments. Users/IDoNotExist

20080626 14:07:09 nbsp 5th of July? Users/SunjeetBaadkar
   wiki:wikipedia:XDay (Church of the SubGenius) Excellent.

20080626 16:32:26 nbsp Im so in!  Ive wanted to attend Davis Wiki BBQ.  And Im totally free (no work and no school)!
 Users/CurlyGirl26

20080626 18:03:33 nbsp Turns out I will be in town afterall.  Sweet! Users/JonathanLawton

20080626 22:53:33 nbsp Ill be gone, but dont let that stop the fun! Users/DougWalter

20080627 09:20:02 nbsp Given the intense heat and other adverse environmental conditions (such as the current smoke problem),  I wonder if it might be a good idea to make the event an indoor event somewhere  either as a potluck, or perhaps as something at an inexpensive restaurant where everyone would order something for themselves.  The current forecast for July 5th is the mid to high 90s. Users/IDoNotExist

20080627 10:26:32 nbsp Good call about the weather.  Plus, I dont know whod do the actual bbqing.  I know I have the ability, but not the commitment or tools. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080627 11:47:04 nbsp I propose having the event at Crepeville.  They have many tables and air conditioning.  Its also easy for people to order individually, but sit as a group there.  They also have a wide variety of relatively inexpensive and tasty food.  The disadvantage is that Crepeville can get crowded, so there is some chance that there will be insufficient seating.  Another possibility is to meet in the MU Coffee House.  There are many free tables there right now because of the summer break.  There are many inexpensive dining options.  Space for a large number of people will be trivial to find. Users/IDoNotExist

20080627 11:54:03 nbsp Dawiso is already meeting at Crepeville on the 13th.  The current weather isnt that bad...  The smoke is a bummer, but I think its keeping things a bit cooler. Users/JonathanLawton

  You beat me to the punch in mentioning Dawiso. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080627 22:37:58 nbsp The Dawiso meeting should also be mentioned somewhere obvious (upcoming events, for example?)  I had no idea that it existed until I read the previous comment. Users/IDoNotExist

           My sentiments exactly. Maybe a link somewhere on the Front Page would be useful. Users/MaryLieth

20080627 23:10:08 nbsp Also, Id suggest naming Dawiso (as well as the BBQ, which I think I mentioned before) with a descriptive name.  What exactly is a Dawiso?  It looks like it might be an acronym for Davis Wiki So.  So?  So what?  So...liloquy?  So...phomore?  There is no explanation of this on the Dawiso page (although there is a description of what the group is), and those who are trying to find a group of wiki users who meet at restaurants and discuss the dihydrogen monoxide problem are unlikely to find it.  Id suggest picking a name that describes what the group actually is, and that is not an acronym.  (Acronyms obfuscate what things actually are, and make it much harder to find the thing you are looking for.) Users/IDoNotExist

20080628 07:53:21 nbsp Personally, Id suggest just making it a Davis Social Meeting, and making it open to all.  Theres an (accidental, I am sure) connotation of a distinction between the Davis Community and the Davis Wiki Community when its phrased like that.  The Davis Wiki serves the Davis Community, not an extracted subset that has meetings unto themselves (or so Id hope).   Users/JabberWokky

20080628 10:46:05 nbsp I totally agree with JW Users/IDoNotExist

20080701 18:26:39 nbsp The owner of Ali Baba is willing to give everyone a discount of $1 off of any order over $10 if we hold the BBQ there.  Note: I am not affiliated with Ali Baba, and I am not the owner of it. Users/IDoNotExist
   Of course not.  The owner of Ali Baba exists!  Users/JabberWokky
   If people want to have meetups at restaurants, thats wonderful, but I think that this should be in addition to the traditional park potluck BBQ, not a replacement. A BBQ in the park is pretty much the most inclusive event possible   families with young kids, people on limited budgets, and people with dietary restrictions are likely to have a hard time at a restaurant. Trust me, youd rather have my kids around at a park than at an eating establishment, unless youre talking McDonalds. Users/JessicaLuedtke

20080701 18:46:32 nbsp If I show up to the BBQ and somebody sees me, do I exist?  And if I do, do I suddenly cease to exist as a result?  If so, then I really dont exist.  :)  And if I dont cease to exist, then I must not exist either. Users/IDoNotExist

20080704 09:48:09 nbsp Is this taking place tomorrow?  If so, where? and when? Users/IDoNotExist

20080704 10:22:48 nbsp Lack of leadership points to no.

  Edit: Who led the previous years bbbqs?  Users/SunjeetBaadkar
    Usually somebody just steps in and declares it so!  Gotta be decisive on the wiki!


20080704 14:47:29 nbsp Id love to lead the bbq, but I have no idea where a good place to set it up is.  Ive been hearing Slide Park is a decent place.  I suppose I can start off and say Ill lead next time...maybe between Summer Sessions in 4 weeks?  Or sooner?  I can buy a grip of charcoal and hot dogs. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080704 22:24:47 nbsp Im down to help! Users/CurlyGirl26

20080705 00:41:06 nbsp Perhaps a rescheduled event would need to have version number 3.1?  :) Users/IDoNotExist

20080719 10:17:05 nbsp How do I make sure we have Slide Park on a particular day?  I was thinking of organizing something for the Sunday between summer sessions. Users/SunjeetBaadkar
 Reservations arent really necessary for the smallish gatherings we have (unlike Celebrate Davis and such). If someone else happens to be using the park for their own event, the more, the merrier, eh? Users/WilliamLewis wl

20080727 15:37:28 nbsp Someone else posted a wiki bbq for August 2nd on the event board (same place and time).  Are these supposed to be the same thing, or two totally separate entities? Users/MaryLieth
 I believe that someone else has already posted in on the events board...  Users/StevenDaubert

20080728 16:40:13 nbsp So the BBQ is this Sunday, right?  Im so there! Users/CurlyGirl26

20080728 21:34:43 nbsp perhaps the ucd meat lab would be a good idea for the BBQ?! communal pool of scratch on delicious flesh? Users/StevenDaubert

20080728 21:45:50 nbsp Crazy idea, but maybe we could combine this with the Bike Churchs work party on Aug 2 (saturday).  They are in danger of being shut down (see the bike church page), so maybe if we got a bunch of people to come out  in addition to having a BBQ  that would help them?  The only question, I think, would be if itd be cool for us to haul a BBQ to the domes.  The church folk would know, though..? Users/PhilipNeustrom

20080729 19:57:07 nbsp Hey, 5 people is a quorum, right? Cool! I hope everyone can make it, Im looking forward to my 1st wikirelated gathering. :) Users/ChrisLambertus

20080730 02:27:47 nbsp man, I havent made a BBQ yet so this will be 3.0 that Ive missed. Users/WesHardaker
  excellent, now go to sleep  Users/StevenDaubert

20080730 10:34:42 nbsp So I scheduled one on saturday then like 10 minutes later, someone moved it to sunday.  What a punk...but hey, Im still going! Users/ChristopherMckenzie

20080730 17:13:54 nbsp Nice drop shadow.  I hope that it is cooler that day than the picture implies... Users/IDoNotExist
 I think the reference in the photo is about internet flames, or at least thats how I saw it...  Users/StevenDaubert
   Open to interpretation, but I when I made it, I was thinking that the event would get so big that those are the people handling the cooking for the huge throngs of attendees.  It brought a smile to my face.  The overuse of Drop Shadows, Internal Shine, Translucency, Rounded Corners and OverlappinTgext is, of course, because this is Version 3.0, even better than Web 2.0.

20080731 16:33:44 nbsp Im so happy this has finally taken off.  Ive been very out of it for the last week and sorta forgot everything about this.  Now Im again looking forward to this weekend.  Maybe Ill bake cookies in addition to the hotdogs.  BTW...how much meat should I bring?  I would bring burgers, but Im sorta low on cash... Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080801 16:44:04 nbsp As usual, Ill be going!  Ill bring a grill, and probably some asyetundetermined stuff. Users/BrentLaabs

20080801 19:06:12 nbsp my plan is to hit costco on the way over for supplies: meat, plates/utensils (disposable), trash bags. I will bring a cooler with some ice too. Users/ChrisLambertus

20080801 19:42:05 nbsp Love the new logo.  I hope to stop by with Jake. Users/EdHenn

20080801 20:20:10 nbsp Sunjeet, do your buns include those of the hamburger variety?  Yes? :D Users/JonathanLawton

20080801 21:03:20 nbsp Are we gonna have name tags?  I want to finally put names to faces. Users/Aaron.Curtin

20080801 21:41:59 nbsp Name tags are a good idea.  Ill bring a Sharpie.  And some of those sticky things if I remember. Users/CurlyGirl26

20080802 02:10:36 nbsp so does slide hill park have bbqs or do i need to  bring one ? Users/ChrisLambertus

20080802 02:11:24 nbsp also: drop me a message here if you want me to pick anything up at costco Users/ChrisLambertus

20080802 08:14:31 nbsp ChrisLambertus  I could use a few of those LCD TVs at Costco if you can fit them in your car. ;) Users/Aaron.Curtin

20080802 10:50:26 nbsp Im wondering if someone should bring some sort of music type device.  I could bring my guitar, but Im not performance worthy at all... Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080802 18:26:43 nbsp I was just thinking someone should bring veggies of some kind.  If I have the money, I might, but I dont want to be bringing too much stuff... (I tend to be stupidly generous) Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080803 03:02:28 nbsp whoever asked me about hamburgers (you werent signed in, just got an IP address,) I can bring some frozen ones from costco. I dont like to make fresh ones for events like this, too much work and too hard to keep everything cold and clean. my meat plan was mainly sausages. Heres my current list:

sausages, costco burgers, cheese, some kind of bread rolls, box of plastic utensils, sack of paper plates, paper towels, charcoal, ignition device, cooler, beer, ice. LCD TVs if I have any money left. :) Users/ChrisLambertus

20080803 11:47:02 nbsp anyone interested in hitting up new Manor pool? Users/StevenDaubert

20080803 20:39:06 nbsp awesome turnout, great crowd, hope everyone had a good time.
 Users/ChrisLambertus
              I agree!  So good meeting everyone!  Users/CurlyGirl26

20080803 20:52:58 nbsp Yup! Users/JenniferRutherford

20080804 09:24:01 nbsp Anybody take any photos? Users/JabberWokky

20080804 10:00:16 nbsp Sorry that I couldnt come  wound up having to be out of Davis for most of the day... Users/IDoNotExist
  Aha! More proof that you dont actually exist.   Users/BrentLaabs

20080804 14:30:52 nbsp Fantastic little get together. An awesomely wide and shady spot. The food was delicious and plentiful and the company was fine. I hope we get to do it again! Users/Sankofa416

20080805 21:12:40 nbsp The food was great and Im glad there was plenty of drinks for everyone (I was worried there wouldnt be enough).  Those short ribs were fantastic!  I think we should have another bbq right before school starts for the fall. Users/SunjeetBaadkar
