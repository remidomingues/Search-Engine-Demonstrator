Oak Tree Plaza is a onelevel openair neighborhood Shopping Centers retail center at the corner of East Covell Boulevard and Pole Line Road on the northern end of East Davis.  It got its name from a large historic oak tree that had to be cut down to build the plaza (go figure!) back in 1978. Soon (circa April 25, 2013), the center may lose most of the rest of its oak trees, when all the Street Trees on Claremont Drive are removed as part of PG&Es http://www.pgecurrents.com/2013/03/07/inhonorofcaliforniaarbordaypgesays“planttherighttreeintherightplace”/ Right Tree, Right Place program. On April 26, 2013, the largest oaks are marked with surveyors tape and remain, though whether for a short or long time is unclear.

The other day (maybe July 26 or July 27, 200?) there was a man out front of longs in playing his guitar and singing elvis tunes.  Does anyone have any info about this guy?  Is he a new feature of Davis?  or an old standby who has changed venues?  Thanks!   Rocksanddirt
   Theres mention of him on the Anderson Plaza page.  Seems to be new.  I sam him infront of Albertsons as well.
