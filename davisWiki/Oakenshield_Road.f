Oakenshield Road is one of the many Navigating Davis streets in Davis Village Homes neighborhood that are named after places or characters in J.R.R. Tolkiens books, The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.

Bombadil Lane branches off from Oakenshield Road.

Oakenshield is the last name of Thorin Oakenshield, the king of the dwarves who, in The Hobbit, accompanied Bilbo Baggins to defeat the great dragon Smaug and recover the Arkenstone, a diamond of great sentimental value to the dwarves. Thorin was killed in the Battle of Five Armies, and the Arkenstone placed on his grave. His name comes from a great battle with Orcs, in which his shield was smashed. Using his axe, he hewed a massive limb off an oak tree and used that to ward off the Orcs blows.
