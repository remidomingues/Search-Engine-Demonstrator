Oakland International Airport is another option for flying out of the area.  While not as big as San Francisco International Airport SFO it is a little closer and easier to get in and out than its big brother across the bay.  They have jetBlue flights to Long Beach for a relatively cheap trip to Southern California.  Sometimes you can get a cheaper flight out of Oakland than out of SFO.


Getting There
Oakland International Airport is off of I880. From I880 South, use the Hegenberger Road exit or follow the exit signs on 98th Avenue to the airport entrance.

Amtrak: The Capitol Corridor has a stop at the Oakland Coliseum.  This stop is across the street from the Coliseum/Oakland Airport BART Station.  Catch the airBART shuttle to the Terminal.

BART: Take Bart to the Coliseum/Oakland Airport BART Station.  Catch the airBART shuttle to the Terminal.

Amtrak AND BART: Since Amtrak and BART go to practically the same place this is probably moot, but if you like that kind of pain, here goes: You can Transfer at Richmond from Amtrak to Bart, then get off at Coliseum/Oakland Airport BART Station.  Catch the airBART shuttle to the Terminal.
