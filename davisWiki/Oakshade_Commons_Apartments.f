NOW LEASING FOR FALL 2014/2015



Oakshade Commons Apartments offers primarily fourbedroom apartments with one twobedroom unit and one fivebedroom unit; apartments are leased through FPI Management. Rents are openly published, and range between $1800$3700.  There are flexible options for roommates, so you should consider the perperson cost rather than the total cost. The fourbedroom units have 3 or 3.5 bathrooms with pretty big bedrooms. Most rooms have two closets except for the smallest room, and the living room is long and narrow, making it difficult to arrange. Each unit is assigned two parking spaces and visitor parking is available, as well as onstreet parking.  As of April 2013, the parking situation is not fully ideal, but in Fall, management is planning to reassign parking spaces to units in a more logical fashion (spaces near units instead of across the property), to create additional guest parking spaces, and to encourage residents to comply with parking policies including nonobstruction of fire lanes, parking in the right spaces, and encouraging use of onstreet parking as appropriate. The pool is really small and its location usually places it in the shade. Safeway, Rite Aid, Office Max, and several food places are right across the street and Unitrans W bus line stops right in front of the complex.

They currently have two, four, and five bedroom apartment homes ranging between $1800  $3700.


 Background Noise 

Bedrooms facing the street may be subject to noise problems from cars and semitrucks passing by at night.  Note also that apartment windows are doublepaned.

One interesting aspect that not many apartments have to offer is the sound of children playing outside. If you pick the right apartment you can hear little kids screaming around having a good time. I found the sound pleasant to hear, but others hated the noise. UPDATE 2014: School is being sold. There were no children playing outside throughout 20132014 residency.


 History 

In 1999, Paul Petrovich proposed building a 3.5 acre shopping center across from Oakshade Town Center, anchored by Ross Dress for Less. The City Council initially approved the proposal but later decided to rezone it after protests from residents and business owners in the area. Petrovich then proposed a 41unit apartment complex above 5,000 square feet of office space. The Council approved the plan in March 2001 and the site is now occupied by Oakshade Commons Apartments, Moshi Moshi, and others.

During the 20032004 academic year under previous management, there were many parties in Oakshade, but this may have changed; it took a while for cops to break up the parties because they are facing away from the street and inside the apartment parking lot. The new management is dealing with complaints about noise steadfastly, and is enforcing rules as agreed to by residents in their lease agreement.

Their management changed to FPI Management on March 6th, 2013.  They used to be under Acadian Properties.

20140128 18:39:56 nbsp Terrible!

The hot water heater stopped working a few days after I moved in. It took them an entire MONTH to fix it! For a MONTH we were without hot water. There were also a few lights in our apartment that were not working when we moved in. It took them even longer to fix some of them. Weve been there 4 months now and some of them still havent been replaced! We have to walk down and up the stairs in the dark because they cant be bothered to install a light for us.

When we first moved in (which was way after the time slot which we were told), the carpets still needed to be cleaned. We had to sit with our stuff outside the rooms for a few days waiting for the cleaner to finally come to clean the carpets (which werent even clean afterwards).

There is a pool, but it took them over a month for us to get a key. Now the pool is closed for maintenance so who knows if well ever get a chance to use it judging by their speed (or lack thereof) of repairs.

There is a storage closet located by the front doors, but it took them a few months for us to get a key that gave us access to it.

The washer and dryers are old ones that will be terrible for your electricity bills.

The model home looked great, but its considerably less enjoyable to live in a place where half the things dont work.

Unless you want terrible maintenance service, dont even think of living here. Users/AbheetBrar


20140504 07:59:00 nbsp Actually quite nice! Would live here again except looking for a onebedroom place for next year.

The comment above refers to a hasty turnover of apartments that management had to deal with, so in the beginning, basically all maintenance requests were ignored for months. Moving in last year was a bit bumpy but theres no reason to believe it would be rough again in 2014, since they have a new manager whos dedicated to Oakshade when before they were doublebooking a manager from another apartment complex.

Whats nice about this place:
Location is SUPERB. About 2 miles from campus (need to bike 1015 minutes or bus to campus probably) and right across the street from a 24 hour Safeway, an Office Max, a Rite Aid, and theres a Starbucks and Wells Fargo inside the Safeway (but those are not 24 hour).

Room is nice, with good closets, nice carpet and a big window. The common space is great. Its nice and all the appliances do their jobs well. Washer and dryer in apartment is very convenient and handle large loads.

What would be different to make this place perfect:
Movein was a bit of a hassle. Something that probably will happen again in 2014 is that youll move in and there will be no blinds on your window and no ceiling light (or any light at all) in your bedroom. These things are inexpensive, but you have to go somewhere to get them, which is difficult without a car.

Noise: Walls are paper thin. Roommate in room on top of mine complained of getting woken up at night when I was speaking at a conversational volume, so basically if you want privacy you have to whisper, even in your own bedroom. You should probably get a fan to block out noise, too. Also, outside of my window there are TWO AC units that start and stop randomly and could wake a corpse from the dead with their noise. Get a fan to block out noise and you dont even notice them!

Oakshade Commons is pretty great. The only reason Im moving out is because Im looking for a onebedroom place and they dont have those here. Oh well. Users/MKC
