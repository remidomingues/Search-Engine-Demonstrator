There is a Bicycle Tire Pumps bicycle tire air pump on the north wall of the building that houses Dos Coyotes.  Although I didnt check how long the hose was, I doubt its long enough to reach the parking lot to fill up your car tires. Users/AlexPomeranz.

Im not sure the pump works anymore.  Its great, because they leave the valve out like itll actually fill up your tires.  Throw it on your bike and watch as your tires deflate.  The only thing I can think of is that either the compressor took a poop or someone doesnt want to pay for the electricity that it uses and thus, they unplugged it.   Users/DavidBarnum
