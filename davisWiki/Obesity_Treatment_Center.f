Obesity Treatment Center is a multidisciplinary weight treatment program serving obese patients in Sacramento since 1983 and Davis since 2004. They use longterm behavioral therapy combined with a medicallysupervised diet. Their team of physicians, behaviorists, dietitians, therapists and exercise physiologists work to help obese patients lose and maintain their weight, treating obesity as a chronic disease of abnormal energy storage and not a lack of willpower.

In June 2006, OTC began a weight management program for those that are overweight, but not obese (body mass index below 30), called the Quick 20 Program  it is designed for clients to lose weight conveniently and quickly under clinical supervision and using OTCs nutrition shakes. Information sessions on OTCs Davis programs are offered every Tuesday at 6:15pm; call for reservations. New patients must submit an application, available in pdf form on their website.

20081021 15:43:17 nbsp I have not experienced this place, but just after looking at their website, they recommend a 1,000 calorie liquid diet plan for people who are not obese but over weight.  Its a low calorie ketogenic diet plan much like Atkins was designed for, less carbs more protein, burn ketones.

Honestly?  That sounds like the worst thing I have heard for someone who only needs to lose 1020 lbs!  I cant believe it!  Obesity Treatment Center is prehistoric when it comes to scientifically proven methodology.  If you are looking to lose weight and Keep It Off go see a real dietitian and join the gym a couple nights a week... Users/CarrieBishop

20090922 13:39:54 nbsp Ok, so the only other comment comes from someone who has NEVER used OTC. I actually have, and have a good friend who has experienced success on their program. The diet is closely supervised by DOCTORS and NURSE PRACTIONERS (not just by dieticians as rec by CarrieBishop). I have tried a LONG time to lose my extra 20 pounds and her advice blows. If you are overweight, give their program a serious shot. I am happy I did! Users/Leslie1200

20101112 00:12:03 nbsp Today obesity has become a major problem in many people around. May be due to the eating habits and the daily lifestyle changes. Some are hereditary but many are due to large consumption of junk food and low amount of physical workout. There are many treatments available for obese people. The simplest step to start lessening the obesity problem is by your own effort in loosening the extra fats in your body either by exercise or by changing your eating habits.
