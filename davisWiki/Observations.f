      incomplete (as always)


{{{

For good content, argue with passion from your heart:
 find the vision of what you know to be right.
 Then carefully vote with your head:
 compromise to meet other peoples view of what is right.

For good community, forgive wholeheartedly every single day
 and freely apologize whenever you might need to be forgiven.
 Let fools be fools, and let people you respect be fools.
 Soon it will be your time to be foolish, despite your care.

Find your own contentment; nobody else can do that for you.
 Something here caught your whimsy.  Either hold fast to it
 or learn to continually find new points of wonder in the whole.

Reading is not movement, and argument is jumping in place.
 It is finding something new, polishing it into a beautiful gift
 and placing it carefully into the shared treasure room
 that moves any  and all!  of us forward.

You know, people always talk about how the internet dulls humanity.  It doesnt.  It amplifies the lowest common denomenator.  The good people are still out there doing good things.  Its just gotten easier for stupidity to not toil in obscurity.

    In the old days, the Internet used to amplify good things  people helping other people without expecting compensation in return.  At least, thats how I remember it.   Users/CovertProfessor


 How to read Reviews 

The subject is generally Good: People who are complaining have nothing specific, people who are lauding have specifics.

The subject is generally Bad: People who are lauding have nothing specific, people who are complaining have specifics.

Exception: One person has the same very specific complaint that they obsess over (possibly including some other items, but there is one thing they are ticked about).  Remove everything they say from the equation and reapply the above.

Davis Wiki and Wiki Spot on the internet, grassroots style:

  http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid1178 May this never happen here.
  An interesting Edwardian take on Alice in Wonderland is The Westminster Alice, by Hector Hugh Munro, who wrote an eerily prescient story of Germany invading England and a wonderful short story entitled Sredni Vashtar.

California vs. The World

I found the Huell Howser of Tennessee!  Instead of Californias Gold, there is http://wnpt.org/productions/crossroads/v2/ Tennessee Crossroads.  The show is a bit different, with different hosts doing segments, but the TN version of Huell is Rob Wilds, who can summon the same strange slowburning hypnotic enthusiasm about the mundane as Huell.  Check out the video on http://www.thepfunkygriddle.com/ The Pfunky Griddles website by clicking Experience The Griddle.  Im still looking for his most Huell like video (the chainsaw lady segment comes close).  As an aside, Huell is from Tennessee originally (thus the accent), went to the University of Tennessee, Knoxville and got his television start in Nashville before moving to and falling in love with California.





Joes Editing Theory

  During April Fools 2011, there was the typical growing insanity on the wiki, including rapid edits to the Front Page.  Joe made this observation which is a pretty amusing and dead on critique of the last year, especially the last six months:

I feel like the edit war on the front page is out of hand. We should lock it down, have an extended and tedious conversation, maybe alienate a longtimer or two, and just generally get bogged down in tangents both technical and philosophical. In four days or so, when everyones sick to death of it, lets compromise, and leave this page up as a remembrance of the good ol times. At some indeterminate point in the future, we can have another tedious and frustrating conversation about whether or not to delete the first talk page. ;Users/JoePomidor

Need to add the Tandem Property point here.
