The tentatively named (see below) Occupy UC Davis grew out of the general Occupy movement as well as concerns over continuing tuition increases and the desire to express solidarity with Occupy Cal’s http://reclaimuc.blogspot.com/2011/11/oncominggeneralhighereducation.html  Call for a Strike and Day of Action. wiki:wikipedia: Occupy UC Davis is separate from Occupy Davis, although there is some overlap of membership and some shared events.  For example, Occupy Davis supported the initial Occupy UC Davis https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid246092445449061 Strike Rally on 15 November 2011 on the UCD Quad.  Other concerns of Occupy UC Davis include privatization of the UC system and militarization of campus police.  Many also identify with the larger OWS issues such as corporate personhood, plutocracy, and class inequality.  Notable events have been the occupation of Mrak Hall and of the Quad, resulting in the November 18, 2011 UC Davis Police Response to Occupy UC Davis.

There are still protest tents on the quad and its not as cold as it looks.  Join the conversation!

There are donated tents available if you do not have your own.

 Actions 

 US Bank 

Although it was not a sanctioned Occupy action, some members of Occupy shut down the US Bank in the MU for several weeks.  US Bank struck a deal with UC Davis administration to be the only bank branch allowed on campus.  All other banks or credit unions were prohibited from setting up branches on campus.  This created a US Bank monopoly of bank branch service on campus.  Many members of UC Davis Occupy support keeping forprofit corporate megabanks off campus and object to the increasing privatization of the university more generally.  The US Bank deal also dictated that every single student ID card be emblazoned with the US Bank corporate logo as a form of advertising.

US Bank announced in a https://twitter.com/#!/RichardYChang/status/180507068803977216/photo/1 letter that it closed its Memorial Union bank branch on February 28, 2012. That US Bank location was no longer profitable to them and they abandoned their branch and fled campus.

On March 30, 2012, the Yolo County District Attorney sent letters to twelve protesters (eleven students and one professor) who were allegedly involved in the protest and blocking at the Memorial Union of US Bank.  They have come to be known as The Davis Dozen.  They have been ordered to appear at an arraignment and face misdemeanor charges.  They will be arraigned on two charges on April 27: obstructing movement on a street or in a public place and conspiracy to commit a misdemeanor.  There is a http://davisdozen.org/petition.php petition calling upon the UC Davis administration to solicit the immediate withdrawal of all criminal charges against students and professors.

 CrossCultural Center 

The former CrossCultural Center was occupied on the afternoon of January 25th, following the movements occupation of buildings worldwide.  On the 26th, some EOP students came to request the building, which had been promised to them by school administration. Some people, including members of the movement, see this as a problematic occupation. Occupying a space that serves marginalized communities has been very alienating to potential allies. One banner quoted Franz Fanon, saying Revolution is the only culture, while the http://bicyclebarricade.wordpress.com/2012/01/24/communiquefromoccupiedcrushculturecenter/ communique mentioned the Crush culture center. This occupation was http://occupyucdavis.org/2012/01/eopfactsheet/ not passed through the General Assembly.

 General Assembly Votes 

  At the GA on Monday (back in November) there was a proposal for a general strike of UC Davis on Monday 28th of November, beginning at 7:30 AM, that passed with 99.5% of the vote.

  The General Assembly of Occupy UC Davis convened and formally voted that it has noconfidence in Linda Katehi to continue to act as Chancellor of the University of California, Davis. Her actions have stripped her of the legitimacy required to continue to rightfully wield the authority of that office.

  The General Assembly of Occupy UC Davis has voted and reached consensus to issue an official, formal demand. We demand change in the institution of the Office of the Chancellor itself. We demand the democratization of that Office, to begin with the implementation of a recall mechanism that will allow a sitting chancellor to be removed from office by democratic means.

 Name of the Movement 

The movement has not definitely decided on a name yet. Some people object to the term Occupy; some prefer Decolonize.  Because tents are present, some feel that the UCD movement should take part in the Occupy identity/brand name.

There was supposed to be a workshop on November 18 at 4pm to discuss the implications and history of the word occupy and other issues of privilege (for example, decolonize is a word that might only make sense to those with privileged access to a certain level of education). Obviously this workshop did not take place due to the pepper spraying. There were privilege workshops during the first week of the winter quarter, but no proposals about a name have yet been presented at the General Assembly.

It is very troubling to many that Occupy has become the default name for the group, given that various cultural heritages have been oppressed under one occupation or another; as a result a number of people feel they cannot participate while this is the name.  This is similar to the way that people feel about the use of the word crusade in Campus Crusade for Christ.  This might be seen to be quibbling about a name and distract from the goals of the movement.  Another view holds that people who dont acknowledge the problems with the name need to http://tjlp.org/privilege101.pdf check their privilege, i.e., they should consider whether they dont consider the name of the group to be important because they dont come from a cultural background that has experienced oppression under occupation and fail to understand the significance of the word occupy for that reason.   Still others understand why some find the name objectionable, yet suspect that a change of name is unrealistic at this point.

20111130 22:04:57 nbsp I think it would be a good idea to screen some documentaries to better inform some people about the issues. Inside Job is a great one. Anyone else like this idea? I have tons of docos Id be willing to share. We could do it from a laptop in the blue dome or if we could get the support of staff  a lecture theatre.

20111202 16:37:55 nbsp Occupy Dutton is getting ridiculous. Tents obstructing the hallways, gatherings of people obstructing the stairways, graffiti in the bathrooms. Ive been strongly in favor of Occupy UCD so far but the behavior of Occupy Dutton is making me rethink my position. Go occupy the Mondavi Center instead; thats where tuition money is being wasted on the 1%! Users/BarnabasTruman

20120226 11:36:36 nbsp Does anyone know what the current state of Occupy UC is? On the quad I see about 45 tents left, but all look vacant (when I pass by 12 times per day), and half have been ruined by the wind. I support protest, but if the movement is over on the quad, somebody should clean up the tents. It looks more like an abandoned campsite than a political protest.  Users/EricJensen
 The movement is very much active; see, e.g., https://www.facebook.com/pages/OccupyUCDavis/262907633759444 their Facebook page for details.  It has shifted focus, however, from occupying the quad to events like http://occupyeducationca.org/wordpress/?p355 March 5 Occupy the Capital and protests of the presence of U.S. Bank on campus.  Of course, this doesnt address your concerns about the tents.  I am not sure whats going on with those.  I imagine they are being kept there as a symbolic gesture.   Users/CovertProfessor

20120226 12:50:59 nbsp Thanks for the update. Im sure its also because the University is too afraid to clean up the tents themselves for fear of bad press. Im curious to see how long they will stay there, and if anyone will either reoccupy or remove them. Its a bit like an experiment in seeing how tents decompose over the course of weeks and months.

 Heh.... yes.   Users/CovertProfessor
