This was a relatively small protests protest concerning the future of public university education in California.

Please edit this page with UCDs plans for this day, and eventually, reports and experiences of the event.

So are there no plans?  Id just like to know if I have to expect bus delays (like last time) tomorrow....Users/OliviaY
  If there is a plan, they havent let the faculty in on it.  (Same thing happened last time, and then people complained that faculty werent more involved...)   Users/CovertProfessor
  Just to be safe, I would avoid driving near the school or taking the buses. Users/hankim
  So happy I graduated... How disrupting classes defends public ed Ill never know. Users/ARWENNHOLD
   Apparently, http://www.davisvanguard.org/index.php?optioncom_content&viewarticle&id3792:whatsthenextstepstudentsstruggletocontinueactionsinlightoffeeincreasesatuc&Itemid118 something did happen.
    Big surprise... ASUCD is useless. Also, they blame apathy for the low turnout which I disagree with. My reasoning for the low turnout is the fact that the previous protest alienated students and the original message against tuition increases was drowned out by a bunch of other things. Users/hankim
