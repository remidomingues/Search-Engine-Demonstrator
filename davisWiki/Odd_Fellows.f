The Independent Order of Odd Fellows, Davis Lodge No. 169

Odd Fellows are named so because In 17th century England, it was http://www.ioof.org/aboutus.html odd to find people organized for the purpose of giving aid to those in need and of pursuing projects for the benefit of all mankind.  Odd Fellows are also known as The Three Link Fraternity which stands for Friendship, Love and Truth.  The mission is To Improve and Elevate the Character of Mankind.  Odd Fellowship became the http://www.ioof.org/aboutus.html 1st national fraternity to create an order for women in 1851.  Although originally considered an Odd Fellow sorority, the Rebekah Order now accepts both women and men.

The Odd Fellows Lodge in Davis was chartered in Davis Timeline/1870 1870, before the City of Davis was incorporated and before UCD was founded.  It is the seventh oldest Davis organization still in existence, although they claim they are the oldest. It was originally known as Yolo Lodge No. 169, and in 2007 changed its name to Davis Lodge No. 169.   Davis Rebekah Lodge Number 253 was created on April 5, 1901, and the organization meets in the same building.

The Davis Lodge had over 100 members at the end of 2009.  Dave Reed is the current Noble Grand of the Davis Odd Fellows, following in the footsteps of Dave Rosenberg. The Davis Lodge is the third biggest Odd Fellow chapter in California, and is one of the only chapters nationwide experiencing growth in membership. It tends to have a more progressive attitude than many of the other chapters, and its members are working to spread that spirit throughout the country and the world.

The Noble Grand of the Rebekahs is Lea Rosenberg and the order has about 40 members.

The Davis Odd Fellows are actively involved in good works throughout the community and provide substantial support to charitable and community groups.  For activities of the lodge, see the Davis Odd Fellows http://www.davisoddfellows.com web site.

During 1909, the Knights of Pythias were meeting every first and third Tuesday here.

Odd Fellows Hall
The Odd Fellows Hall is located at 415 2nd Street Second Street in Downtown Davis, and has been in the Second Street location since 1955.  The original Hall was built in 1875 and was located on G Street.  The current Hall, located right downtown, is a fairly unique building in Davis. Before it was renovated, community activities at the hall were sparsely advertised although Whole Earth Festival held a fundraiser in the bottom floor, and there were pancake breakfasts.  The Hall underwent a major $1 million remodel in 2006 and now sees regular community use.  KDRT held a benefit concert last January.  The Peoples Vanguard of Davis held a http://davisvanguard.blogspot.com/2007/07/vanguardpacksoddfellowsforbirthday.html birthday party, and most recently the Hall was used on Martin Luther King Day.
The Odd Fellows also host Davis only Bingo games, on the second Sunday of each month.  Some Bingo games are fundraising activities for local nonprofits, like http://www.dhspta.org/davisfootball Davis Football Backers.  Information on Davis Bingo can be found at http://www.davisbingo.com here.  Bingo games are open to the general public and players can win up to $250 in a game.

Hall rental information is available at http://www.rentdavislodge.com here, and the facility managers name is Dody Black

20090128 19:31:01 nbsp IOOF members, in addition to promoting friendship, love, and truth also http://www.ioof.org/ sponsor belief in a supreme being, the creator and preserver of the universe. Users/ZacharyNorwood ZN

20090130 01:47:14 nbsp The Odd Fellows in Sacramento allow LARP undead creatures of the night to use their facility.  On Saturdays, people playing vampires swarm all over their hall.  While that doesnt necessarily say much about the local Odd Fellows, the organization in general seems to be willing to allow very odd groups to rent their lodges. Users/JabberWokky

20100127 22:03:07 nbsp It should be noted that the Davis Chapter of the Odd Fellows has declared itself a nonpolitical, nonreligious organization, a policy which the Sovereign Grand Lodge is aware of and has not taken exception to (officially.) The International Order still requires belief in a Supreme Being, but the Davis Chapter will consider anyone with an ethical disposition, desire to make strong connections within the community, and who are willing to serve others. (Note I am not speaking for IOOF in any capacity, these are my own words and my own impressions as a pledge)Users/JohnathanQuigley

20100319 18:43:10 nbsp So, is this literally just a charitable organization or does it have quasimystical, ritualistic elements similar to other groups such as the Freemasons?   Users/ScottMeehleib
 Lets call it a little of both Daubert
