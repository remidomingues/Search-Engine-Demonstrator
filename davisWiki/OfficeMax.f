The local OfficeMax (now owned by Office Depot) store is one of 1800 national stores in the office supply store chain.  In addition to their intown store, they can order anything from their catalog. Shipping is free for orders over $50, which is typical for most large office supply stores. Orders can be shipped to your home/office or to the store, and they usually arrive within 13 business days.  They carry furniture, paper, laptop bags, and all sorts of office supplies.  If you are part of their rewards program, aka MaxPerks, you can recycle your old OEM inkjet or toner cartridges and  https://www.officemaxperks.com/RecyclingProgram.aspx get $1 off per cartridge in addition to getting 5% of what you spend back in rewards.

There is a Shipping Services FedEx dropoff at the front of the store.  The ImPress counter in the back of the store offers fullservice FedEx ground and express shipping services, which is convenient for those who dont want to venture downtown to FedEx Office(formerly Kinkos).

There is an Impress Print and Document Services inside, which is far cheaper than FedEx Office(formerly Kinkos). ImPress has a wide range of products and services available, including highquality poster printing, wideformat laminating, binding services, business cards, custom stamps (some of which can be made whileyouwait), name badges, banners, etc.

 Services 

There are discounts for bulk printing and copying options but they are generally still more expensive than Copyland and FedEx Office if you talk to the manager, Lance, he will offer to beat any intown price by 10% if you get a written quote.

The ImPress department offers bulk document shredding services. They accept paper, file folders and envelopes.  Staples and paper clips are okay, but they cannot shred credit cards or CDs.  Shredding costs $.99 per pound.  At the ImPress counter, your documents are weighed and then placed in locked, secured bins.  The shredding company comes in at least once a month, but usually more often as the service is popular and the bins fill quickly.  Only the shredding company has access to the documents once in the bins and they shred them onsite in the OfficeMax parking lot.  Customers are provided with a copy of the Certificate of Destruction after their documents have been shredded, at their request.  Its recommended that you call ahead before coming in with your shredding because if the bins are full, they cannot accept any additional shredding.  If you do call and they are full, its usually only 2 or 3 days before the bins are empty again.

UC Davis students receive a 10% discount on instore copy, print and finishing services with a valid Aggie Card.  UCD faculty and staff receive contract pricing on most ImPress services which can make using ImPress substantially cheaper than any other print/copy shop in town, including UCD ReproGraphics and the campus Print Labs.

20060828 13:30:25 nbsp If youre planning a visit to OfficeMax, save to steep in unadulterated incompetence, you might want to reconsider.  Today, I phoned this establishment and very politely explained that I was seeking a very specific calculator  the TI10.  I explained that I was calling to ensure that they carried this item before I biked over.  After a moment of silence, the employee informed me that yes, indeed, that particular calculator could be found in aisle seven.  Imagine my delight!  40 minutes later, I was standing in this very aisle, awash in every imaginable calculator  but not the TI10.  I asked the manager, still politely, if she could help me find the TI10, which my previous phone call verified she carried.  I was met with only a blank, glassyeyed stare.  The TI10?  Never heard of it... you mean this?  And she brandishes some HP blasphemous POS!  Egad!  My disappointment was offset, fortunately, by a lovely first experience at Taqueria Davis. Users/JamesShearer

20060905 13:13:42 nbsp You will rarely find me defending this establishment (I work there, you see).  But I find it quite unfair to generalize about the incompetence of the employees.  Some of the members of the staff are still new and learning the ropes.  There are, however, several people who have been working there for several years and really know their stuff.  Whoever answered the phone should have checked the shelf (or had someone check), but since the Davis schools began last week, we have been absolutely swamped.  Because we carry a fair amount of Texas Instruments calculators, she probably just assumed that we carried it.  Thats not an excuse, but it would be nice if people would cut us some slack. Users/JennSuzuki

20061118 18:04:58 nbsp There is no use defending this officemax. It has to be one of the worse establishments in Davis. You said There are, however, several people who have been working there for several years and really know their stuff. Actually, the new people are not as incompetent as the management team and the regular staff. Dont expect them to know anything about eletronics. I have reported them to the BBB before. Btw, this comment is from countless of experiences in that store. You ask, why do I keep coming back if I hate it? They are the only choice if you cant drive up to woodland. Users/VinhBoy

20070322 16:03:53 nbsp I got so annoyed that they used to ask me like 800 times if I wanted an extended warranty on like mechanical pencils or something, but my old coworker worked there and said the manager used to work at Best Buy and forces the employees to offer it. Users/BradBenedict

20070324 14:20:50 nbsp all the managers make them offer the extended warranties.  they get yelled at if they dont offer/sell enough of them because the managers get yelled at if their store doesnt sell enough. Users/JennSuzuki

20070924 23:48:15 nbsp Who knew getting organized would be so expensive. Very few items under $5. Other places are probably more wallet friendly.   Users/DavidHolcomb

20071113 18:06:19 nbsp When Ive called OfficeMax for copying and lamination quotes from the Impress copying center in the past, theyve also quoted me Kinkos price, which Ive found interesting and helpful (and truthful, since I had also called Kinkos).  Users/ElleWeber

20071220 22:32:06 nbsp Horrible staff...they are just rude....  I dont know what is wrong with them???  Some of them are very nice, but some of them also are rude and not friendy at allhorrible.  I was so disappointed.  I prefer Kinkos and ebay.com.  I will not come back unless the rude staff members dont work there anymore.   Users/viviancute

20080110 22:51:45 nbsp Not so bad, this place.  I have had a normal shopping experience there. Users/apalley

20081208 16:51:11 nbsp they have a corner rounder, but its for 81/2x11 Users/StevenDaubert

20090106 21:20:48 nbsp Just a normal Office Max. Nothing exceptionally good or bad Users/SprawlNBrawl

20090826 14:25:34 nbsp I paid a visit with a friend to OfficeMaxs print shop today and walked away pretty happy.  We needed to print off a color calendar as a gift on cardstock and have it coil bound.  Fullpage photos above the month grids had to come out in the right orientation.  From our quick survey of prices they were the least expensive.  A few places wanted $4.99 to have paper bound; they only wanted $2.99 which includes one plastic page protector and one opaque rear protector.  To have fullservice color print on cardstock (including price of cardstock) was $1.14 for the first side, then $0.49 for the other side.  It was LASER printed and came out perfectly... any color issues were due to my laziness at correcting for print :).  They even punched a hole to facilitate hanging the calendar for us... simple details like that make me happy. Lance helped us and he knew his stuff! Users/RyanMikulovsky

20090827 09:07:01 nbsp OfficeMax provides one of the best discounts for universityaffiliated research groups (possibly departments too), as compared to Office Depot or Staplers.  At Davis, we (and our neighboring labs) used to use OfficeMax almost exclusively.  Ive found the same thing at UCLA, most of the lab groups in this department get a far larger discount at OfficeMax. The tradeoff is a lot less variety than their competitors (which sucks for electronics or office chairs), but our most frequent purchases are the simple supplies like paper and printer toner, so it really adds up.  Users/EdWins

20091018 18:14:08 nbsp It is not true that copies cost far less than Kinkos theyre exactly the same price for black and white copies.  Users/mewood86

20091209 11:19:01 nbsp @JennSuzuki: I dont get it. Should we cut OfficeMax employees slack for not doing their jobs? Im sick of people expecting to get slack because theyre not doing what is expected of them; do your job right, and Ill stop complaining. Users/TimJ

20100107 09:41:43 nbsp Last time I was here (1/2/10), I had a terrible experience. An employee, who reeked of cigarette smoke was very rude and made me feel as if I shouldnt be in the store unless I bought everything he relentlessly pushed on me. Needless to say I will not be returning. Save your time and money and go to Target. Users/DerrickJ

20100331 21:09:29 nbsp I got annoyed reading books in pdf format so I went here to have it printed out.  They got it finished in a few hours and I only paid about $6 for the 150 B&W double sided pages and some binding (I think the cashier messed up BUT it couldve been just a great deal) Users/vzegarski

Not sure what they are good at, know what they are not good at though and one of them is contacting people who have pending orders. My advice, go to FedEx Kinkos, Davis Copy or any of the other local print shops in town. Ridiculous.  Users/WesP

20101020 13:30:18 nbsp I am a regular customer at Office Max and wouldnt have it any other way.  I am continually impressed by the staff one in particular, Lance.  If you need a project done creatively, efficiently and correctly then you need to pay him a visit.  Whether its the daily grind orders or a project Ive procrastinated about Lance is by my side and he is instrumental in my companys success.  He conducts himself in a professional manner, listens to your ideas and collaborates with you on how youd like to see it produced.  Good luck finding that type of service anywhere else!  Thank you Office Max for hiring Lance and please dont ever let him leave!    Users/Megan38

20101123 14:27:59 nbsp I second the kudos for Lance! He helped me with a complicated project that required lots of patience and cybertweaking. He never gave up and got me exactly what I needed (for a ridiculously low price).  Users/ZoraDillon

20101123 21:12:16 nbsp I disregarded the comments about bad experiences thinking it was just situational.  But I was wrong.  I called OfficeMax to ask about their ink refills and the person on the phone said they do refills for $10. I get there on the bus from east Davis, its $20 because it was a previously refilled cartridge. Apparently they charge you $10 more for not having to wait 5 minutes while its getting refilled.  The worker gives me the wrong one I tell her and she looks again.  She realizes there isnt any prefilled and asks me to wait.  She gives me back $10.  I go back home with my refilled cartridge only to realize that my printer does not read the cartridge.  I return the ink cartridge and they say sorry. I get my money back and leave.  I dont have a car and I had to take 2 buses going there and 2 buses to come back. There is no point in going to OfficeMax Users/RobinDell

20110410 17:15:32 nbsp I am very upset about my ink refill. I first call in to make sure they refill ink. They said they do, so I go over and give them my cartridges. This female associate told me someone is in front of me, and should be done by the end of today. Meaning no later than 6, which is fine. She said when its finished, someone will give me a call. I decided to call them before closing, and the lady goes: Oh, actually, the ink machine is out of scale. It wont be done by tonight. GREAT, she knew it was out of scale and didnt give me a call until I called her. Wasted my time waiting for these past hours, with plenty of papers needed to be printed out. Im never getting my ink refilled there. Horrible service.  Users/RebeccaCho


20110713 19:29:36 nbsp By the way, to everyone refilling their ink cartridges... Dont mean to sound like an ass, but buy a new HP LaserJet for under $100, youll get tons more pages with the included (although lower capacity than retail) toner cartridge than you will ever get for the money by refilling inkjet cartridges (at a much higher print quality, by the way). If you really NEED a color print for something specific, go to the store to get it printed. If you are like 99% of the people out there, 99% of what you print is black & white anyway. If you dont print very often, your inkjet cartridges will dry up and clog as well. Users/EricWecker

20120210 17:09:46 nbsp I have faxed a few things here and it usually goes pretty well if there is actually someone working in that section.  I also made a ton of copies here while doing my research and I found the price to be reasonable.  They also usually have good deals on printer paper but I go elsewhere for better priced ink. Users/LoriOrf

20120823 14:55:18 nbsp Went there to get a new mouse for my laptop. Got a good one for $18, which is an okay price. I got offered a 2year warranty on the mouse (cost $3), which is a little strange. The staff were very nice and the store was wellorganized. Users/ElvenAngel
