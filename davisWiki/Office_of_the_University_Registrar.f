Commonly referred to as just the Registrar, this is the primary administrative division we all know and love to hate. They archive and process virtually all campus documents and transcripts, as well as maintaining student records. They cover everything from admissions to classes, to Undergraduate Student Fees student fees, to filing for graduation.  Make sure you remember to file for graduation early, since the deadline comes up in the first couple weeks of the quarter. The Registrars Office is often criticized for its stringent policies late fees are no longer allowed to be waived, deadlines for certain types of documents are firm.

If you lose your Aggie Card AggieCard you must go to the AggieCard office located on the first floor of the Memorial Union. The AggieCard has replaced the Reg Card. AggieCards are no longer offered at the Registrar office on 12 Mrak Hall.

The Registrar also maintains an http://registrar.ucdavis.edu/html/academic_calendar.html Academic Calendar which is pretty useful.

20091130 20:15:38 nbsp why is it so expensive to get transcripts? and why does it cost extra to order them online, or have them same day? at my old university they were much cheaper, could be ordered online for no extra cost, and you could recieve them the same day without having to pay more...

  Because they print it on a nice piece of paper, or they like extorting students. Users/hankim

20101020 00:27:44 nbsp Had a bad experience with the staff members here.
I came in worried that I would go over the unit cap and since a friend told me that I could have units removed I asked them about it and they not only looked at me like I was crazy but proceeded to lecture me on why I was completely wrong and crazy for even thinking such a thing exists.
I wish I had come in a few second earlier because the lady at the next desk seemed a lot nicer than the women I talked to but that nice lady was busy helping a different student.
Shame on them for making me feel stupid/crazy. Users/rootmeansquare

20110410 07:51:25 nbsp I agree with rootmeansquare. one of the ladies there is not very pleasant or reassuring. I felt like I walked into the DMV or the post office, the way she acts. Oh well, it is just something to deal with, not everyone will be happy and smiling in your face. Other than that, the rest of the staff, they are extremely helpful.  Users/Sandlot3
