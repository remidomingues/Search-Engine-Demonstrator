20110804 15:36:07 nbsp Welcome to the wiki!  Thanks for adding your recollections for departed businesses and history of existing businesses!  They really add to the pages.  You mentioned that Davis needs a oldfashioned ice cream shop... I am curious, what do you think of the Davis Creamery, now part of Sugar Daddies?  Is that the sort of place you mean, or something else?  I like that they make their own ice cream and have some unusual flavors along with the regular ones.  Users/CovertProfessor

20110804 15:51:59 nbsp I love the recollections! Users/TomGarberson

   Ditto this.  Thank you for sharing!  Users/PhilipNeustrom

20110804 16:37:07 nbsp Thanks very much for adding your knowledge of local history to the wiki! I hope you are able to find out the name of that steak place that used to be in the Silver Dragon spot. Ive been trying to figure that out for a long time! Users/ScottMeehleib

20110804 17:47:47 nbsp Welcome aboard! Nice work! Users/PeterBoulay

20110804 18:22:29 nbsp I dont remember the name of the steakhouse, but I do remember its red logo with a T.  Toppers comes to mind.  Maybe that helps.  Do you remember Angelas in the Anderson Plaza in the mid or late 1960s.  Our family used to enjoy going there for pizza when we lived on Oeste Dr, Users/SueHjerpe

20110805 12:37:29 nbsp Thanks everybody!

So yah, long time resident, just moved back from Sac. where Id been for a few years.  Ill try my hand at editing/adding some defunct places as well, thank you for the suggestion.  FYI  73 refers to the year of my birth.  Thanks again for all the kind replies.

Ill definitely have to check out the Davis Creamery/Sugar Daddies place with the kids.  Yolo Berry is good too, I guess Im just nostalgic for that old Classic Creamery atmosphere.

Scott  yah, it was Peking (now Silver Dragon)... want to say it was briefly Golden (something) before that.  Dont know what the name of the Steakhouse was, but right Sue, it did have the Red Logo with the T.  The rest of the information I got was from my parents, who moved us to Davis from the East coast in 74.  I remember similar decor at Milk Farm in Dixon, actually... but I was young, it might have been a bit different.

Cant say I remember Angelas pizza... one thing on restaurants though: Davis restaurants seem to trend heavily in food types/nationalities in profusion over the years.  In the mid 80s, seems like there were 100 (great exaggeration) Chinese Food places.  These days, I come in to town and there a thousand (greater exaggeration!) Thai places.  I love both kinds of food (especially Thai), but it just seems to ebb and flow so much for such a small town.  I guess its because of campus, it just still has always seemed extreme to me. Users/OldDavis73
 The food fads in Davis come off as pretty extreme to me as well. Besides Thai, there are so many Japanese sushi places these days as well, and now of course there is the frozen yogurt obsession.   SM

20111110 13:01:57 nbsp No problem. :) Users/ScottMeehleib

20120619 12:58:25 nbsp Oh, you rock.  Awesome. Users/CovertProfessor
 Thanks very much.  Just couldnt keep looking at the wiki without a pic of the Davis Arch...!
   Yes, its been sorely needed!!  Do you know what the sign on the right side of the picture says?  Home of... ?Users/CovertProfessor
    Thanks to my years staring at the mural, I do... Home of University Farm.
     Ah, fabulous!  Im going to add that to the page, too.  cp

20120619 13:11:45 nbsp That is just wonderful!  Thank you so very much for that photo! Users/JabberWokky
  My pleasure, thank you!

20120619 15:10:38 nbsp Ha!  Great minds.  :) Users/CovertProfessor
 Ha ha, exactly.  Great Ice Cream page, by the way!
   Agreed!  A fun, informative page built bit by bit, by lots of editors adding what they know  as you just did!  (Thanks again).  cp

20120620 02:44:25 nbsp hey good call on the comment integration Users/StevenDaubert
  Thank you.  OF course, I did it partially for selfish reasons... obsessing on the possible existence of a 90 year old ice cream shop!

20120706 15:49:38 nbsp I got what you meant in an old world style pub.  I do think it satisfies some aspect of what people were looking for, even if its not a dead on match to the specific type. Users/JabberWokky
   Thank you... Im glad Im not the only one who was trying to feel the intent of the wish there.  Thanks again.

20121027 12:19:16 nbsp hey when did the south davis mcdonalds open? Users/davisrox
   Wow, I want to say that was... 1983? Bob Dunning would be able to tell you exactly when.  I still remember a picture of him on the front page of the Davis Enterprise eating the first Davis McDonalds Big Mac.  The controversy at the time was akin to the recent Target store coming to Davis... a lot of people at the time thought having a big time fast food place was the wrong fit for the town, while others were sick of having to travel several miles out of town for their fix.

20130308 12:47:15 nbsp thanks for adding the jacks urban eats info. I was planning on going in when they opened and talking them up re wiki Users/StevenDaubert
  No worries, thanks Steven.  A lot of upcoming changes to Marketplace Ive got to throw on to that list!
