The California Aggie Marching Banduhs Old Bandroom consisted of several rooms inside the Old Firehouse.  Right next to Putah Creek and just across from the T. Elliot Weier Redwood Grove, the Aggie Band inhabited the space for some 30odd years.  The building was  and still is  home to rats, cockroaches, and a particular musty smell.  I guess thats what you get when you dont clean for 20 years.

In the Spring of 2004, the band moved out of the Old Firehouse and into the brand new Activities and Recreation Center (ARC), where they have much more space to work and play, and far fewer rats to kill.  But the Aggie Band will always miss the Old Firehouse.  It just felt like home...


The front of the Old Firehouse.  Behind the garage door was the locker room.


The locker room.  Imagine changing in here, shoulder to shoulder, sweaty and smelly after a football game, and suddenly a rat decides to run between your legs!


The old drumroom.  It was once the main office.  A door to the right with a large 69 painted on it (not in view) leads to the locker room.

The door to the main Bandroom.



The Stunts area, complete with sink!



Some one didnt read the warning...



The Instrument Room, no people.



Instrument Room, with people.  Someones music is all over the floor.  Dirty Cooler is sitting on the couch.


Different configuration of the instrument area.


The music area in good condition.


Shit hanging from the ceiling from old Picnic Day floats, the picture board on the right with flute and net area below, and the trombone shelves at the far end.



The Historians photo board and a sign that someone gave the band in the 80s.  The hole in the ceiling near the College arrow is one place rats used to climb in.



The door to outside is on the left, the Ossifers Office door on the right.



The Office. Rats used to crawl around on top of the cabinets.  11 people in here at once before rehearsal was cozy!



It got a little cramped before/ after rehearsal and gigs...
