The Old North Davis Neighborhood Association (ONDNA) is one of several Neighborhood Associations in Davis.  The boundaries of Old North Davis are 5th Street 5th, 7th Street 7th, B Street B, and G Street G streets.  There is an interesting book called Old North Davis: Guide to walking a traditional neighborhood by JohnLofland John Lofland that includes more details and history of this area of town.  It is available at Bogeys Books, the Hattie Weber museum, and the Davis public library.

The Old North is one of the three heritage neighborhoods in Davis, that is, neighborhoods designated by the City as conservation districts with special overlay zoning. Along with the downtown area, these neighborhoods contain almost all of Davis Landmark and Merit Resource designated historic structures. Old North is an area of lively infill, adaptive reuse, renovation & rehabilitation activity. The houses in this neighborhood tend to have amazing basements; one such basement is that of the house F and 6th and another is that of 512 F Street.

Like all the Davis Neighborhood Associations, the ONDNA is a grass roots democratic organization of residents (not an owners association). Membership is open to residents, land owners (residents or not), and area organizations.

Where should this comment be put?:  Ive noticed that theres an additional street sign on top of the two street signs at 90 degrees to each other at several intersections north of 5th Street downtown.  Its slightly shorter than the two street signs below it.  It says Old Noth Davis and has a graphic.  This does not seem like a good idea.  It doesnt help someone trying to see where they are;  its confusing;  it takes time away from seeing the two other signs and it is an unnecesary expenditure.  Are similar signs planned for other places in town? Heres a suggestion:  If theres to be an historical sign such as this, it should have an appearance which is less obvious and different in appearance from the signs that are for more immediate usage.

  The sign has a different shape, color and set of fonts from the street signs. While Im sorry you were/are confused, I dont think that this is an issue for most sign readers. Users/DougWalter
  Also, the signs were paid for by the neighborhood association, so any unnecessary expenditure was that made by residents of the hood. Users/ScottLay
