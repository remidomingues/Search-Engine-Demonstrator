The Olde Dining Commons/Segundo Services Center was the Dining Commons for the Segundo area up until opening of the Segundo Dining Commons new building in the Summer of 2005. The old dining commons was located in the building in the center of the Segundo towers. After the old DC closed, it was later used to house The Junction. This old DC was at its time the largest food court on campus. It housed much of the same things that the new location has minus the fancy wood fire for pizzas and the comfortable seating. Instead, most diners ate at either a small array of round tables, one of the many long communal tables or on tables outside in the central courtyard. The central courtyard featured outdoor dining at tables under the shade of a giant oak tree. The old dining commons was nice in that it had tall floor to ceiling glass walls which allowed plenty of sunlight.

The old dining commons was replaced due to severe overcrowding. The opening of the new Segundo North residence halls in 2003 before the new DC was completed didnt help the crowding situation either.

The SSC also housed an Area Service Desk, the Segundo Academic Advising Centers Academic Advising Center, a Learning Resource Center, a Laundromat Laundry room, a television studio, and Sodexho offices.

The original Junction was a very small room located next to the lounge which featured a piano, TV, and pool table. It was a nice gathering spot for people to play pool and watch TV.

The Junction later moved into part of the space that used to be the original Segundo DC. The space was much larger and allowed for a bigger selection of food items.

The Old Segundo Services Center was eventually demolished, and the new Segundo Services Center opened in Fall of 2011.

20051026 23:18:16 nbsp Old DC was ridiculously crowded in the 200203 year.  I cant imagine how they did with the 3 new Segundo buildings they made.  Huge tables were nice, setup wasnt the very best. But for Special dinner nights the line was over 2 hours long, multiple times.   I agree with Gilad  the huge tables are nice and fun.  Whether theyre long and rectangular or just a round table we can fit 12 people around.  Just from the pictures above (Prior to being Segundo Dining Commons moved) the new one looks a bit too trendy for me.  Doesnt have the cool college feel.  I will try to eat there sometime. And there werent that many outdoor tables in the older DC.  They were also always covered in bird shit and leaves, as well as food spills. Not many people wanted to sit outside.  Does the new DC have the fat stacks of newspapers from all over in front of it?  I loved that. Users/Edwins ES

20051209 02:20:08 nbsp During the 20012002 school year I would frequently gorge myself at the Old Segundo DC and all was well. One day I noticed a bug crawling around the self serve slices of cheese in the Grill area so I told a young DC worker who was standing by. He said nothing. He moved towards the cheese dish and with his one gloved hand, he poked the bug to death atop the stack of cheese slices. Then he looked at me and asked if that was alright. I left the Grill disillusioned by the food service industry. I thought about telling some kind of authority figure but I wasnt sure if they would believe me. What if that worker was normally polite and accomodating but was having a really shitty day. He would probably toss that slice, deny the whole thing and Id be the guy that made up crazy stories.
