Older comments for PHM Property Management

I would NOT live at a place managed by  I saw three places (one home, one townhome, and an apartment type place) and they were seriously the most ghetto I have ever seen.

20050306 22:19:07 nbsp PHM is a terrible management comparny. Their properties are dirty, poorly maintained, and the rent is way too high. Our washing machine stayed broken for 6 weeks! Users/EyadDarras

20050327 14:12:11 nbsp I also agree that PHM is not a reputable property mgmt company.  They are unorganized, do not return phone calls, do not complete work orders  I would not live in a property rented by PHM.  Users/LuvDavis

20050414 10:07:12 nbsp Verry Shabby! This is one of the MOST nonresponsive property managers in the area. No returning of phone calls & No maintenance. Users/DavisRenter

20050415 10:59:58 nbsp Our washing machine is broken again! Rather than being considerate when explaining that the washing machine would not be replaced for another week, the folks at PHM were surly and rude as usual, Avoid PHM at all costs. Users/EyadDarras

20050505 12:00:16 nbsp I have rented as an adult for 12 years and PHM is by far the WORST property management I have ever experienced.  I want to take out a full page add in the Enterprise warning people to never live in one of their units.  They are rude when things happen like, I dont know, the roof leaks and your mattress and boxspring are runied and it takes them a week to get the roofer to come to your house.  Mean while youre sleeping in the living room and they wont return your calls or let you know whats going on.  I will never live in one of their properties again and neither should you! Users/LucyYardley

20050530 13:52:59 nbsp I am extremely wary about a company that does not include rental price in nearly all their listings.  It leaves the door wide open to quote different prices based on the callers voice and presumed traits.   Users/OlderRenter

20050614 18:02:11 nbsp I completely agree with the comments above.  These people are pathetic when it comes to maintenance.  Do NOT live in any of their properties. Users/PhmRenter

20060106 08:00:12 nbsp I was about to rent a property with PHM, so I gave them the fee for the background check. The property was rented out from under me, and since they did not yet do the background check, I asked for my money back. Months and months of constant calling and showing up at the door progressed the situation from soandso will take care of it to you must have already cashed it to who are you? Users/KarlMogel

20060106 16:18:26 nbsp My suggestion is that if you ever have a problem with PHM threaten to sue them for not following the California Tenet and Landlord Laws. After months of calling and trying to get them to do a walkthrough so we could get our deposit back, we did just this and they gave us our entire deposit back very quickly. Users/RachelPeters

20060117 09:51:30 nbsp This is possibly the worst business I have ever dealt with, bar none.  And I have lived abroad.  These people do not fix things on time, and when they DO get around to coming to your place, their incompetent repairman suggests trite things like, Well, have you plugged it in?.  Also, they never showed up for my walkthru and have yet to return my security deposit.  If I receive no satisfaction soon, I plan to file suit.  Perhaps others would like to join me in a classaction? Users/AndyMcCall

20060130 10:01:33 nbsp From being something of a PHM apologist, I now reverse everything good I ever said about them. They have broken our contract, the law and our patience. They havent returned phone calls or fixed the problems we have brought to their attention. This has now been going on for over a month. Users/KevinWeedon

20060131 10:44:39 nbsp Our apartment just changed management companies from PHM  the new guys have replaces all the outdoors lights (it used to be PITCH BLACK on the stairs at night). The thermocouple on our heater was broken, and it was fixed  but their handyman is one of my coworkers. I dont know if it would have got fixed if I didnt know him. Users/EmmaCoats

20060413 13:27:28 nbsp Thought Id add to the list of complaints against PHM.  I havent lived at the apartment managed by them for about 6 months now but I still hold a grudge.  It took 2.5 months to get my security deposit back, they stood me up at our final walk through meeting, during the first month I lived there there was a HUGE pile of garbage in place of the dumpster next to the apartments, they are consistently rude and never return calls.  Avoid them at all costs!   Users/DanPotter

20060509 15:48:12 nbsp The people at PHM are completely incompetent. When we arrived to move in to our house, it was TRASHED, and they didnt even know if the previous tenants had left yet. It took days beyond when our lease was supposed to start to get it in livable shape. They never return phone calls, take forever to respond to questions/problems and even then only after repeated requests, and their front desk employee called me a liar to my face. Dealing with PHM is like beating your head against a brick wall after youve already ripped out all your hair. Users/LynneSilverpaw

20061205 12:40:41 nbsp Im a current tenant with PHM  they complete maintenance requests after you ask them 15 times and yell at them. Its like pulling teeth trying to get them to come out and do something. I HATE LIVING IN A HOUSE LEASED FROM PHM. I will never do it again.   Users/SandyRose

20070123 14:55:14 nbsp I made the call to report them to the Better Business Bureau. Even if you dont think you have a case  try it  get these people to shape up or at least make it known that they seriously SUCK.  Users/SandyRose

20070306 22:10:47 nbsp Does anyone know much about their maintenance people? Do they ever call your home to follow up on a repair? Users/RemSteele

20070306 22:11:47 nbsp Also, has anyone ever had things stolen from their home with PHM being the management company who rents you your home?  Users/RemSteele

20070427 14:49:39 nbsp STAY AWAY!  When I was finally given a lease to sign, there were so many shady clauses, many of which went directly against statements which they had made or implied to me in person.  When I brought this up they told me that they would be unable to rent to me.  I guess they dont want to rent to people who can read.  This would have been my 7th lease, so I know that their requirements were much, much more unreasonable than the average lease.  Dealing with them was a big waste of time.

20070502 07:57:16 nbsp I have to admit that, even though I rented from PHM for five years, I never experienced a problem with the company.  In fact, I once threw my rent check in my bag before work, and forgot to drop it off before going on vacation.  When I got back, I discovered the problem, and they accepted my rent check without imposing a late fee which they had every right to do.  I do admit that I have not called them for maintenance issues, but rather repaired the few things that broke on my own.  Like they say, your results may vary. Users/DavidGrundler

20070513 17:17:31 nbsp I rented from PHM for a bit over a year. They have large properties for low rental prices (not well kept up, but if youre just there for a year or two, a good deal).  While the staff and owners are nice, my experiences lead me to believe their business is disorganized.  Maintenance requests sit for well over the 30 day limit and security deposit amounts on leases seem random amounts.  If you are persistent, you will be treated fairly (I was), but you have to contact them many times and get everything in writing (and reread it before signing!).  Again, kind and friendly staff that I honestly dont think intend to make things difficult or to rip people off  but poor business skills make it a frustrating company from which to rent a property.   Users/SaraMeyer

20070612 12:01:19 nbsp Maybe PHM property did improve lately because we don’t have any problem with them. We have been renting a place with them since december 2006 and everytime we need something to be fixed, they send a technician in the next days. They are not so well organized : yes ; but they do care for their tenants. Users/hector&rosy

20070628 12:19:26 nbsp they are the most disorganized people I have ever met. I dont think they have a current lease on our place.  They never tell us whats going on, one day we came home and 4 trees were removed from our front and back yard. No one told us anything! They dont have our phone numbers, and they dont know who lives here (2 of my roomies have been replaced). But the rent is fairly cheap.   Users/accordionatedmI

20070708 15:39:02 nbsp I have lived in several places in Davis and this is the worst rental company ever! They waited until the same day we moved in to clean the apartment. They just dusted a couple corners and that was it. The carpet looked like it had never been cleaned and it had some spots from previous tenants killing bugs on it. You have to talk to them multiple times to get anything done. They are really nice to you only BEFORE you sign the lease. After that it is hell. Users/ecoloco69

20070720 01:10:55 nbsp I must admit, PHM seems to have significantly improved their response time and their staff but I gave up on the house a long time ago /  Users/SandyRose

20071218 17:14:20 nbsp I want to say that I have just had a very wonderful experience with this management company.  One of my older relatives lives in a rental managed by PHM and they have been so caring and considerate with her.  When my daughter goes to college, this company will be my first choice when looking for a place for her. Thank you PHM. Users/Davischick

20080219 10:21:57 nbsp My 6 month rental management contract ended September 2007.  They collected over $4,000 in deposit money which has still not been turned over to me nearly five months later.  Did they invade their escrow account and spend it on a vacation or just what?  They have not communicated. Users/xylasma

20080315 11:41:54 nbsp When we moved in last June, I tried setting up an appointment for a walk through but was never responded to. When we moved in, the house was FILTHY! Our fences blew down in the big storm in January and I have made several requests to have them fixed and have yet to receive a response. So the front of our house looks like crap. Im generally a very tolerant and patient person but it has been 2 months!! I must say the staff is very nice but I am so fed up I will never rent from PHM again.  Users/Chelsie

20080720 20:01:04 nbsp We had very mixed experiences with PHM. We were in the unusual situation of needing to rent a large house with 4 petsPHM was willing to work with us on that. We paid a large deposit for the pets but were grateful to find a place. Our walkthroughs at the beginning and ends of our tenancy occurred as scheduledno problems other than that some of the promised cleaning/repairs never occurred (which was an ongoing pattern over the 2+ yrs we lived there). We were careful to leave the place nearly spotless and received almost all of our deposit back in a very timely manner. Also, generally very friendly. Overall a better experience than most have reported here. NylaLogsdenSackett Users/nls

20080730 12:30:14 nbsp Ive had nothing but positive experiences with PHM.  Marianna is great to work with; she keeps in touch and takes care of my calls and concerns in great time.  The rest of the staff as well is courteous and helpful.    I have not experienced any of the negatives as mentioned in some other posts.   We have been here close to 2 years and enjoy very much living in our comfy house. Users/vlantry

20080812 15:18:26 nbsp This is a very good company to work with, if you have very low expectations.
They will not return your calls. They will tell you one thing and will do the other. Then they will apologize and will ignore you all over again.
Don’t waste your time on PHM.
 Users/shotcal

20090408 13:28:51 nbsp Things must have changed because I have had nothing but a good experience with the company.  They even met me after hours to show me some of the houses they had available.  They allowed us to setup a payment plan so we didnt have to pay the whole security deposit at one time.  The house was clean when we moved in and the few minor repairs that did need attention were taken care of within a few days. Im glad we chose to rent from PHM. Users/Monica73
