20050813 11:09:04 nbsp The beer is great, and the calamari appetizer is awesome.  On the expensive side, but worth it. Users/AlexPomeranz

20050825 22:03:40 nbsp Im a UCD grad that moved to Seattle WA and i really miss this beer  does anybody know if they will ship cases to individuals? Users/RonReynolds
  No, they dont ship to individuals but you can purchase their beer through http://www.bevmo.com Beverages and More. They have stores all over the country but they can also ship http://www.bevmo.com/productlist.asp?Nttsudwerk&NtkAll&Dsudwerk&Nty1 most beers to you.  Users/BrianMartinez

20050915 01:59:09 nbsp Pint nights are not bottom of barrel. If you notice, they use the same taps to fill everyones glasses. Sudwerk has gone through many ownership changes over the last 12 years, none of them for the better. Great place to go if you want a liter of HefeWeizen, but terrible if you want dinner within a 3 hour window. Users/ChrisLambertus

20050927 15:32:13 nbsp Im a beer lover from Germany, and I do think their beer is great  quite an oasis in Budweiser country! I recommend their unfiltered Pilsener. Plus their prices are very reasonable: $3.75 for half a liter (about a pint) of freshly brewed gourmet beer is a good deal. On a side note, their menu misspells the names of some beers, such as Hefe Weizen opposed to Hefeweizen. Still tastes good, though! Users/JoFeuerstein

20050927 19:37:34 nbsp Thanks to Sudwerk some of us do know what good beer tastes like! Users/KenjiYamada

20051001 18:35:35 nbsp I highly recommend the Marzen. Ive sampled all of the beers and this remains to be my favorite. The Helles isnt too bad either. Users/BrettCoder

20051001 20:27:42 nbsp Wheat beer is best! Users/CarlosOverstreet

20051023 15:28:38 nbsp The beer is lovely, but dinner is a big dont. When we accidentally arrived 15 minutes before they started serving dinner, they seated us but refused to give us dinner menus. We should have taken the hint: the food was flavorless and gloppy. Oh well. Next time, drinks only! Users/WendeFeller

20051116 23:00:42 nbsp When I die, I hope that there will be a Sudwerks beer in my hand. Users/MikeMele

20051216 04:51:26 nbsp Good beer.  Marzen is great, Helles is good, Pilsner is good, Bocks are good, but the Hefeweizen is better had elsewhere.  For people new to their beers, I recommend the beer variety serving they offer.

Food is decent, the service was slow (not atypical at plenty of restaurants though).  Large dinner portions.  Overall, a great dining experience, especially if you are itching for something different.   Users/JohnNapier

  FWIW, I think Sudwerks Hefe is better than Pyramid or Widmer, which are the two other brands I commonly see floating around this area. Users/AlexPomeranz
  Have you tried the DunkelWeizen yet? Users/TarZxf
    I have. Its fantastic! Users/BrianMartinez
  Nope. :)  Is it a seasonal?  I should add to my comment that if you like Sudwerks Hefe Wiezen, Pyramids Apricot Weizen (formerly Apricot Ale) is quite good.  Especially if you can find it on tap. Users/AlexPomeranz
    I think it is seasonal, and on tap currently. Users/TarZxf

20051216 13:17:54 nbsp mmm....Dopplebock Users/MyaBrn

20051226 13:23:16 nbsp Widmer is a beer brewed in Oregon, and distributed across California.  I do prefer theirs to Sudwerks, but thats my opinion. Users/JohnNapier

20060113 10:16:01 nbsp p.s Widmer is distributed by AnheuserBusch and is substantially inferior to any product from Sudwerk... http://www.anheuserbusch.com/overview/abi.html Users/FromBayarea

20060113 10:17:22 nbsp Great food, fantastic beer. One of the best restaurants in Davis. A Users/FromBayarea

20060113 14:42:16 nbsp I have never understood how this restaurant manages to stay in business.  Their beer is nothing special and their food is worse.  If you want good German food, or even good food, go elsewhere. Users/ToNils
   I agree about the food, but what beer do you have in mind as being better than Sudwerks? Users/KenjiYamada

20060122 14:05:56 nbsp Frombayarea, what does AnheuserBusch distributing Widmer have to do with the quality of the beer?  Wheat beer should taste wheaty, and both beers accomplish that.  Theyve both won awards, and theyve both been given mediocre ratings from the public gurus on ratebeer, in small sample sizes.  So, who gives a shit? Users/JohnNapier

20060122 14:16:46 nbsp ToNils, where do you recommend for German food?  You can count the number of mostly German restaurants in Davis and the Sacramento area on one hand.   Users/JohnNapier

20060201 00:56:30 nbsp Hi, well Im not ToNils but I can recommend a couple of places to go for good German eats.  However, they are not close.  First and foremost I recommend DJs Bistro in concord.  Across from the park and shop.  A great place, nice and European feeling, while maintaining that American ideal of a rather opulent Europe.  The food is an agreeable price with Cezch and German beers on tap.  Both Weiss und Schwarz.  In San Francisco I recommend Die Suppen KÃ¼che.  Naturally pricier, and more European in the fact that if you are a party of 2 they will sit you at a table for 6, so be prepared to make new friends.  More of a country feel, which can be a tad bit upsetting due to the price hike and the travel.  Worth it to me.  Maybe not to you.  Check em out none the less. Users/AndrewBanta

20060201 11:23:29 nbsp Despite the fact that I agree with most of the other posters concerning Sudwerks food, you cant go wrong with a sausage sampler plate and a half liter of Marzen.  Im a Dopplebock phenatic and I find their Dopplebock a little too mediciny.  For a real treat, try an Optimator Dopplebock, (by Spaten, and also avaliable at the CoOp Users/AndrewBanta).  Available in big bottles at the Covell Nugget and 6packs at Aggie Liquor. Users/GrumpyoldGeek
   Thanks for the Optimator tip, Ill check that out!  I havent been able to find Doppel Bock brewed by anybody but Sudwerk so far.  Users/KenjiYamada

20060319 18:18:16 nbsp What is it with you people and the beer?  The food is amazing.  Id recommend the kartofel phankeutchen (sp?) or the fish and chips.  The Hubsch burger is pretty good too.  It is a bit pricey.  I heard that they changed owners? Users/KevinRollins

20060322 01:55:17 nbsp Great beer, but today (Tuesday) they took last orders at 9.30pm and kicked us out at 10:00pm! Users/JoFeuerstein

20060322 01:56:36 nbsp KevinRollins, you probably mean Kartoffelpfannkuchen (potato pancakes) Users/JoFeuerstein

20060418 02:23:48 nbsp Contrary to popular belief the pints served at Dollar Pint Night are full 16 ounce pints if filled to the very top of the cup. I measured this myself. Users/BrianMartinez

20060516 08:48:35 nbsp Sudwerk has great beer and the bartenders are always cool.  My wife and I have had dinner several times here, however, and the waitstaff is always slow and indifferent.  Being slow isnt that big of a deal because it gives me more time to drink beer, but being checked on by your waiter every now and then always adds a nice touch to the dining experience.  This is on top of the fact that most times weve dined here it hasnt been even remotely busy.  However, for what its worth, weve kept coming back . . . Users/AdamSchneider

20060603 21:17:33 nbsp Random question, but does anyone know when Sudwerk was founded in Davis..? Users/TrishAng

20060604 19:52:16 nbsp Went there for the Aggie banquet. Much much bigger than I expected and I like it quite a lot; will be returning. SS

20060729 20:09:10 nbsp The food looks kinda expensive. I want to give this place a shot though. Does the atmosphere of the bar get in the way of just having a dinner there? Im lame. I know. Users/LiRic
  Nevermind to my question. I went to eat dinner there tonight. I agree that the potato pancakes are good but it is way too much sausage for one person. The price is worth it too since it comes with a massive bowl of yummy chowder. Id recommend the place if you share an entree. Users/LiRic
