 About Me 
 Current 
Hi! Im Oleg (pronounced OhLeg). Im an alumni of UC Davis and I never know what to put in an About Me section. P
P.S. This page is probably quite a bit out of date, since I no longer reside in Davis.
 Education 
I graduated as a Computer Science CSE major, though have interests spread across various other (mostly engineeringrelated) topics such as Physics, Mathematics, Mechanical Engineering, Philosophy, Psychology, etc...
Although Im not yet sure as to which area in wiki:wikipedia:Computer Science Im going to be specializing in, I have a very wide spread interest ranging from common things like wiki:wikipedia:Programming, to rarer fascinations such as wiki:wikipedia:Computer Security or wiki:wikipedia:Artificial Intelligence, to rather unusual hobbies such as clientside (read: legal) wiki:wikipedia:Hacker (programmer subculture) Memory Editing and finally to the absurdly ridiculous such as wiki:wikipedia:Pixel Art.
I would have happily minored in Physics or perhaps a foreign language (wiki:wikipedia:Korean Language Korean, wiki:wikipedia:Japanese Language Japanese, wiki:wikipedia:French Language French in that order), if I had enough time or units to accomplish this in four years, but for the better or worse, Computer Science CSE has a very full curriculum.

My classes:
 Athletics 
I love sports and Exercise exercising in general, but theres of course certain activities that attract me more than others.
I am addicted to martial arts, particularly #head261b9b7670bda3ab104558a83dd2fc9dbc6e9e3b Tae Kwon Do which gets #head261b9b7670bda3ab104558a83dd2fc9dbc6e9e3b its own section. I also actively practice Kung Fu Wushu with the Kung Fu Club UC Davis Wushu Club. I have also, in the past, practiced Judo, Hapkido (Korean Aikido), Kumdo (Korean Kendo), Sambo, Short Staff Combat, Nunchaku Combat and GrecoRoman Wrestling (Who Hasnt...).
In high school, during my junior I joined the cross country team. I got really into running and at my top shape ran a 2miler in 10:40 (which would be a little over
5minute mile time for a single mile). Unfortunately I injured my knee during fall of senior year and had to sit the entire season out. Due to this Im now fairly slow (by my own standards at least), and dont run nearly as much as before. However, Im still addicted to Asics running shoes. )
#head41b94d54dc4e7a3c0c13712339c798c60ac37084 Biking is a more recent fascination which also has its #head41b94d54dc4e7a3c0c13712339c798c60ac37084 own section.
Besides these I really enjoy an occasional game of table tennis (A.K.A. pingpong) and Badminton. I love swimming but prefer to do it in rivers.
 History 
Im wiki:wikipedia:Russian and was born in what I call the flat, blank, middle of wiki:wikipedia:Siberia. Unlike the common misconception, Siberia is not like wiki:wikipedia:Antarctica, and wiki:wikipedia:penguins would die of heat there. Siberia does not have constant 1,000,000,000 degrees Kelvin (waa...aay below absolute zero) temperatures as some people seem to think. In fact, during winter it gets to about 40 degrees Celsius (40 degrees Fahrenheit), and during the summer up to about 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit). I think its a wonderful place to live but unfortunately Russia in a political toilet at the moment, so Im happy that Im in USA (especially since wiki:wikipedia:Obama took office). I moved to the States when I was 10 (A.K.A. year 2000), and have lived in the (southern) bay area from that time until moving to Davis.
 TaeKwonDo 
Ive been actively practicing Tae Kwon Do TaeKwonDo since 2003 and currently train with the http://sportclubs.ucdavis.edu/taekwondo/ UC Davis TaeKwonDo Club.
Im currently a http://www.kukkiwon.or.kr/english/index.jsp Kukkiwon (http://www.wtf.org/wtf_eng/main/main_eng.html World TaeKwonDo Federation Headquarters) certified second Dan black belt.
Im also the webmaster for the http://nctausa.com/ National Collegiate Taekwondo Association.
TaeKwonDo plays a very large role in my life and is important to me.

20090930 10:18:59 nbsp Oleg  I can totally help you out on that bike related wish list.  I have Velocity Deep Vs in white and can lace them to colored IRO, Formula, Dia Compe, Suzue, Dura Ace or even Phil wood hubs.  We do standard lacing patterns or even some crazy ones in colored spokes if you want.  I have white straps too in somas toshis or MKS fit Alphas.  Swing by the shop I have all kinds of stuff at the shop. Users/Aaron.Curtin
  Thank you, Ill definitely swing by APEX when Im ready to purchase. But for now, theyre mostly on the wish list due to financial reasons... Users/Oleg.Lokhvitsky

20101018 12:30:28 nbsp Dude, Oleg! Matloff is A+++++! >O Users/MysticHLE
  20101022 20:41:49 nbsp Haha, no way, waaaaaaay too boring/slow.
 Also, Id only go as far as saying he knows his stats. In comp. sci. hes about 30 years behind...
 But then again, even on RMP.com, his ratings differ like crazy. (Either really bad, or really good.) Users/Oleg.Lokhvitsky

20110131 03:25:54 nbsp I like the Gaia avatar customizations for each category.  Definitely one of the cooler daviswiki profiles :D Users/RyanMeyerhoff
