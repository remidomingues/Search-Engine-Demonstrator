Nestled between the Train Tracks and Interstate 80 I80, Olive Drive is one of Davis older neighborhoods, with a distinct smalltown feel despite its proximity to the bustling Downtown and the busy transportation corridors. Fullgrown Olive Trees line each side of the street, and the sidewalk is stained purple by their fruit.  It is also home to a number of very impressive Cork Trees cork oak trees, many of which are on the http://www.city.davis.ca.us/pcs/trees/landmark.cfm City of Davis Landmark Trees list.

Olive Drive starts as an exit off I80 West, and runs west alongside the train tracks just opposite 2nd Street for several blocks until its end at the South Davis Bike Path and Olive Drive Shopping Center. The street is home to two Trailer Parks.  While there is an Olive Drive exit off of I80, it is quicker to exit at Richards Blvd. to reach almost all locations on Olive Drive.

The part of Olive Drive east of Richards Blvd. is part of the historic U.S. Highway 40, also known as the Lincoln Highway, the nations first transcontinental highway.  U.S. 40 continues westward at Richards Blvd. and eastward at I80.

There is also a music scene local band whose name is Olive Drive the band Olive Drive.

 Other features 

  Olive Drive is approximately southcentral with respect to the rest of the city.

  Look for the OldDrunkGuy that sits in a chair, wearing headphones, drinking, and yelling a lot while listening to radio. I think its his job. Also the transvestite streetcleaner; the top half is a guy, but he usually wears a skirt and pumps.
  The Worst Intersection in Davis

  Though it had already established itself as the Olive Trees shadiest Cork Trees areas of Davis, the street gained notoriety when someone living on the street tried to dispose of several hundred pounds of human remains  by placing tupperware containers of body parts out with the trash.

  When the city revamped the Amtrak Station to make it beautiful and accessible to the downtown area, planners neglected to allow any safe crossing from Olive Drive, which borders the station on the other side. Currently, some Olive residents walk down a partially paved road, past some rusting farm equipment, and through a gap in the fence to reach the train tracks. Pedestrians then climb across the tracks and up a small ledge, wave goodmorning to the homeless individuals sitting on the other side of the tracks, and continue through the gorgeous, wellmaintained train station to the edge of downtown.

  There is a walking/bike trail that starts at the eastern end of Olive, right where the offramp from Interstate 80 comes off the highway.  It runs parallel and directly adjacent to I80, and there are patches of the fence that separates them that arent intact. There are patches of the old Lincoln Highway visible to the sides of the bike path.
