Ray Davidson opened the Olive Drive Barber Shop in 1958. Frank Vidales came on in 1963, bought the shop in 1970, and was the owner through September 2011 (so, for over forty years!).

Comments from Franks time as owner:

  20070405 15:22:47 nbsp Frank gives a decent haircut, plays good music, and is a great bet for barbershop conversation/humor. Prices have increased to $17 or 18 though, so Ive switched to another local shop that charges five bucks less. Switch back to your old prices Frank! Users/matty_s

  20090328 11:01:23 nbsp Frank is classic; hes been here over 40 years and just works Thursday through Saturday to cut hair and chat with those hes known for decades (he takes any walk ins though); You simply cant beat the experience in this oldgasstationturnedold barbershop; hours are very limited, and be warned the closing hour is when Frank leaves, not when you can get a last appointment; lots of cool old trinkets in the shop to look at, and some cool barber poles; Frank charges a bit more than others, but you simply cant buy the experience for less. Users/AlanMiller

  20100813 12:13:56 nbsp Great, simple haircut at a classic location. Frank has some interesting stories, and he wants to talk TO you, not AT you. A little pricey, but worth it in my book. I will surely be going back when I can. Users/ColinOConnor

20110916 11:02:03 nbsp Lily is fantastic!  I followed her over from her last shop.  Shes nice and her work is both consistent and of high quality.  I solidly recommend this place.  Its an easy walk from downtown, or theres plenty of parking. Users/GrdStudentT

     >Well, it was an easy walk from downtown until U.P. put up their Fing militarygrade fence. Users/AlanMiller

20110928 17:47:51 nbsp Lily has cut my hair the last 4 times and Im very happy with her skills.When I went to the davis barbershop today she wasnt there so I left and found her at her new location on Olive Dr. My new barbershop! Brian Users/BrianBusby

20111004 15:20:39 nbsp Lily is the best! Great haircut at a reasonable price. The shop is clean and bright with lots of toys for the kids. Whats not to like??? Users/GeorgeFisher

20111005 18:36:30 nbsp Just got my first hair cut here for the first time. Lily did a perfect job! Im the typical asian and had a fade and spikes.  Just let her know exactly what you want and she will do it! Theres a great student deal her for a reasonable 10 dollars also. Will def. come here again.  Users/FredyTu

20111014 15:24:23 nbsp We followed Lily to her new place, she is great.  Very patient with my son and lots of toys for the children.  The new shop is really easy to get to by car and you dont have to fight for parking. Users/JeffFriend

20111024 16:23:01 nbsp We also followed Lily from her previous shop.  My two year old LOVES getting his haircuts from Lily and looks forward to playing with the toys she keeps in the shop!  She is patient and speedy â€“ everything you need for a good kids cut.  My husband now goes to Lily for his haircuts and his hair looks great too.  GREAT PRICE, GREAT SERVICE, and LILY IS SUPER FRIENDLY  :) Users/mdb

20111029 19:01:48 nbsp I was a client of Franks for years.  Frank was great, except he was only open three days a week and took vacations on the fly even so.  With the fence going up, I havent made the trek around to try Lilys version.  I finally went today and was quite impressed.  I have a weird haircut and described it to Lily who did a great job figuring it out.  She even brought out a straight razor and warm foam to clean the details, and offered a free eyebrow trim.  She has kept the spirit of the old shop, even some of Franks old toys, added a few of her own and it all works quite well.  I will be making the long trek around to Olive Drive regularly.  I am impressed. Users/AlanMiller

20120221 22:18:12 nbsp Lily gives great haircuts at a great price! My husband tried her first, and came out looking very nice (unlike lots of lousy past results). I finally went in there with my two young daughters. She has a wall full of toys, so they were entertained while I got cut, then they each went, and we all came out looking great. Its a nofrills place, no shampooing or sets, but hey, what a deal! Users/NicoleR

20120307 17:29:58 nbsp Lilly does a great job.  After looking for the right barber all over Davis, I finally found Lilly.   Users/JimStewart

20120314 19:46:29 nbsp I used to go regularly to Davis Barber Shop until I realized that my favorite person there was no longer there.  Thanks to the power of the wiki, I found Lily at Olive Drive and am so glad.  Lily has always done an excellent job, often cutting my hair faster and better than other barbers.  Unlike others that will make multiple motions with the clippers to make it just right while leaving your hair looking choppy, her motions are smooth and even, providing a sharp look.  Plus, I really enjoy the razor shave of my neck.  Shes also offered in the past to trim my eyebrows at no extra charge.  Its the little things that go a long way.  I hope business picks up for Lily because shes the best Ive been to in town.  I know Ill be a regular over there. Users/BrettCoder

20120320 10:53:45 nbsp Lily is the best in town. She cut my hair for more than two years while I was in Davis. It would have been longer if I hadnt moved to the Bay Area.  Users/MattLow

20120925 09:58:02 nbsp IF you do not know how to speak Chinese or you are not good in Body language DO Not go there. Otherwise, you will get a funny Chinese hair cut. I defiantly agree with those who said she is good for Kids hair cut, kids are usually cute with the funny Chinese hair cut. every morning when I wake up and see my hairs in the mirror.. its just a mess on my head instead of hair cut. She has shaved all around my head !!! topically Chinese!! She is turning your seat to the street and when she is done messing at your head she will turn the seat back to the mirror!! it too late ....

  Lily isnt Chinese. Users/DonShor

  Racist much? Users/Davidlm
  Wow on top of being completely offbase and untrue, that is so offensive! Our whole family comes here, mom, dad and two kids, we always get great cuts AND great conversation! In English!Users/NicoleR

20130104 14:58:40 nbsp I just got about 3 inches off, bringing my hair to about shoulder length. Lily did a great job. Id definitely go back. Users/NicholasBarry

20130516 14:10:23 nbsp I read a lot of reviews on local barbershops before making my decision, but I personally feel like I made the wrong decision.  Im used to my old barber up north who really took his time and made sure I got exactly what I wanted, which I feel should be what a haircut is about.  Your haircut defines you and makes up a huge portion of your style, which defines what impression you make on a person.  When I got here, I was simply asked what number for the sides and I eyeballed a size with my fingers because I wanted to go with a longer than normal size on my sides.  As soon I said that, a portion of the side of my hair was on the floor and the side of my head was much shorter than I requested.. but I cant put the hair back on my head so I decided Id live with it.  She asked me how long on top and I told her about and inch and a half.  Same story.  Hair was off faster than my ability object to anything (and I couldnt see because my back was to the mirror).  When I was turned around I was in shock because it wasnt anything how I wanted or pictured in my headmy hair looks very generic.  I asked to have the back of my head tapered so I could hurry up and get out of there, but the taper I received was very poorportions of the back of my head are very uneven and it doesnt transition smoothly to the top.  I will definitely have to go somewhere else now and spend even more money to have my hair fixed.

Reading all the comments, a lot of people love coming here but I feel the cut was way too rushed and didnt have the time put in that I was hoping, which is why I left very unsatisfied with the service I received. Users/BrianIgarashi

20130907 13:48:13 nbsp Ive only gotten my haircut at Olive Drive since moving to Davis. I used to spend $30 on my haircut about every 3 weeks and it was ok. Not terrible, but not great. Lily is a haircutting wizard at $10 (for UCD students.) I debated even posting this because I dont want to have to wait in line.
The other people that work there are solid for the $. Not mindblowing, but definitely decent.  Users/JJStoops
