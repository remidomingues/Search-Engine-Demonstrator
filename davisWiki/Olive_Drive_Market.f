A small Convenience Stores convenience store contained within The Lexington apartments complex on Olive Drive, this Market has some amazing prices:

  $1 for a large coffee
  25¢ for a large cup of hot water (for tea or cocoa mix)
  99¢ for any size fountain drink
  99¢ for any size Icee
  Cheapest Kegs in Davis
  $1 samosas on occasion, homemade by the managers wife

They compete quite heavily with the University Shell Shell Gasoline station just down the street. The people who work here are usually very friendly and even learn the names of regulars.

As reported in the 20060413 California Aggie, they can now sell liquor.
