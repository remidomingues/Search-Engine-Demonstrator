 Interesting Tidbits 

  Currently postdoctoral researcher at the http://www.idav.ucdavis.edu Institute for Data Analysis and Visualization (IDAV, formerly CIPIC) located in beautiful Academic Surge.

  Has been in Davis since April 1998, first as visiting scholar, then as PhD student, boosting the concentration of latenight grad students in Academic Surge.

  Is of the opininion that the secondfloor eastend mens bathroom there is one of the cleanest ones on campus, but wont add it to the list (see Cleanest Bathrooms) to keep it a secret.

  Likes to refer to the Memorial Union MU as marvellous union, and is a regular customer of the goop counter. Yum, chicken tetrazzini!

  Likes to dazzle register operators by giving weird change (such as $3.12 when the amount is $2.87  do the math).

  Loves to teach Weeder Classes weeder classes such as ECS 120. Mwahahaha!

  Never updates his personal website or Wiki page.
   Well, duh, I am now! Just keep complaining, and Ill do stuff. At some point.  Users/OliverKreylos Oliver Kreylos

  Secret mission: Go to every Davis Wiki page Users/EricKlein Eric Klein ever edited, and edit his edits  just to piss him off.

  I must be procrastinating, because Im actually changing my Wiki page! (12/06/2005)

  I just learned from the Computer Science Wiki page that I allegedly worked my students to death during my ECSnbsp175 class in Spring 2005. I dont know whether to be proud of this. At least almost everybody did really well, and many of the final projects were truly stunning. And several of the best students are now doing research at IDAV, so the comment about ECSnbsp175 being a recruiting class is definitely spoton. To elaborate a bit, and spill a notsosecret secret, I recommend taking the class early. We prefer to hire people who wont graduate in a few weeks. And it takes normally at least a quarter in rampup time before a new student can do productive research.

  Ive recently spent all my time getting the KeckCAVES holodeck in the Physics and Geology building up and running. Ill put together a detailed Wiki page on that later. Promise. Heres a teaser picture for the time being:

  Oh, and since the chances of me actually updating this in the near future are almost nil: Here is my http://graphics.idav.ucdavis.edu/~okreylos/ResDev Research & Development page. Chances of that being uptodate are much higher.


20041215 12:21:40 nbsp Hello Oliver. I dont know if you remeber me but I came to see the amazing 3d visualization software you work on with my research advisor, Dr. Guo. Its good to see you on the wiki. How are things going?  Users/DanMasiel

20050215 23:32:48 nbsp I <3 the odd change thing.  Unfortunately, some cashiers get horribly confused and it takes even longer.   Users/MarieHuynh

20050215 23:34:13 nbsp Oh, and Ive heard about the horrors of 120 and have been advised to never take it unless absolutely necessary.  What else do you teach? Users/MarieHuynh

20050216 00:01:44 nbsp I want to be oliver kreylos when I grow up Users/TravisGrathwell

20050216 11:06:20 nbsp If youre going to take ECS120, Oliver is a great guy to take it from.  He taught it the best out of the three times Ive seen it done (one as a student, twice as TA). Users/JevanGray

20050216 16:07:32 nbsp Id like to take this moment to clarify, however, that no one in the world would consider 120 a weeder class. Users/TravisGrathwell

20051206 18:30:63 nbsp I seem to have a fan! Yay! Users/OliverKreylos

20060107 00:08:21 nbsp Hi Oliver! Users/IrinaChakraborty
