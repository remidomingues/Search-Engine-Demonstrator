20100310 08:52:50 nbsp Definitely pointless.  As a fellow labbie, I was groaning.  Im pretty sure that as the world ends in 2012 and Jesus walks again and as the asteroid is hours from hitting the earth and the zombie hoards take over....my lab will be pulling straws to see who needs to stay and monitor the TC room.

20100310 09:29:25 nbsp When Sarah was working in a lab at UCD, she was doing desiccation tests of samples at various hour intervals.  The ones lower than about ten hours were okay... start in the morning, pull them later that day.  Later on, when I was sitting with flashers on near the Chem 194 barricade, having driven her to the lab at 3am for the third day in a row, well... that got old quick.  But experiments have their own constraints that dont fit into neat schedules all the time, and some are years worth of work. Bleah.  jw Users/JabberWokky

20100514 22:57:07 nbsp If youre out along 580 somewhere, drop by Sansar on First Street in Livermore.  By far the best Indian food Ive had in my life.  Their lamb saag is every bit as good as everything else there.  Seriously, its worth the trip for the food alone.  Its also just a block away from the new First Street Alehouse, which is one of the best upscale pubs Ive been to (the old location having been one of the best downscale pubs Ive been to...). Users/TomGarberson

20100518 07:44:51 nbsp Re: Restaurants without automatic gratuity: Not a bad idea for a page.  The note I added may be wrong; Ive never given much thought to it, and am curious.  I tend to read the edges of menus and have seen the notice here and there, but Id be surprised if it was over, say, 10% of restaurants in Davis that did it.  Its a neat idea to list them and get a actual count and figure out what the actual prevalence of the requirement is. Users/JabberWokky
 I think its a good idea, too, though it might also be helpful to have a list of the ones that do have an automatic gratuity (and for how many people and how much).  That way, we know the difference between those that definitely have an automatic gratuity and one that wikizens just havent figured out yet.  cp
  What about just renaming the page to Automatic Gratuity and listing both those that do and those that dont have it?  We could have a separate category for ones with unusual figures (e.g. KetMoRee with its 5 people/20%).  Obviously itd be a bit of a project to fill it out very thoroughly, but itll get done gradually. Users/TomGarberson
   That sounds like a good idea to me.  cp
   Sounds great.  I had the idea for this late last night and wanted to at least get the ball rolling by making the page.  Then I went to bed.  Users/OliviaY
    Its probably easiest to maintain a page of businesses that do require a gratuity (much smaller) than one of those that do not.  Or to incorporate a note about the automatic gratuity onto the page for the business itself, within the pricing info for that business.   Users/IDoNotExist

20100609 15:19:03 nbsp I think we need a list of places that serve actually spicy foods in Davis. I was about to create the new page but then realized I could not think of anything. Thought you might know some? Users/hankim

20100610 01:59:50 nbsp I feel like I am bouncing around Thai places looking for one to satisfy me. Users/hankim

20100626 22:01:23 nbsp I guess I did not make it very clear in my response to the comment, but I meant that most Thai places I have been to had waiters/waitresses who would ask if I wanted rice without making it clear that it costs extra. Users/hankim

20100821 06:31:23 nbsp Belated congrats on gradumacating.  Are you sticking around in davis, or...? Users/TomGarberson

20101007 12:43:06 nbsp Yup...  I can agree to an extent. The cover is going to help pay for the PSO (Guard) cards required for all of the bouncers and for additional classes that the security staff is going to need to be attending. It is also going to cover some of the additional fees the city of Davis will be placing on many of the establishments in town which serve both restaurant food and liquor. How long will the cover charge last? I am not sure.

As for Little Prague and prices, we do have lower priced alcohol than many establishments in town, if not the lowest, especially in October when we have $3.50 well drinks and 24 oz. Beers for $5.00 all month. We are also one of the few bars in town that have a dance floor.  In addition to this we have begun to serve fresh burgers and brats (bratwurst and weiswurst) every ThursdaySaturday.

Usually, I will be on the door but do make trips through the establishment from time to time. I am there every Wednesday through Saturday from 9pm onwards.

If you are truly worried about the cover charge, I would suggest to you that you show up early on (say around 9pm) get your stamp, come in for a few minutes and maybe have a drink or two, then go to the other bars you wish to visit. If you return, you already have the stamp and will be able to enter without paying the cover.

Look for me next time youre in and I will take a few moments to discuss anything you might wish to say about the establishment. Also would be nice to meet another Wiki user.  Thanks for your input. Users/WesP

20101027 15:42:46 nbsp I love your blog name.  If you ever should need to tell baking powder from baking soda in the future: dissolve a bit in water.  Baking powder fizzes by itself, because theres an acidic component in the powder.  Baking soda doesnt fizz alone. Users/JudithTruman

20101223 11:46:18 nbsp Are you sure that Red Orchid is under new ownership?  There is definitely a new menu.  If there is a new owner, we should probably archive the old comments and start fresh.  Im willing to do that, but dont want to make the effort until we know for sure about the ownership.

Im hoping that there is some Hunantofulike dish on that new menu (there were a few tofu dishes), but I havent had a chance to figure that out yet. Users/CovertProfessor

20110329 17:49:50 nbsp you must be trolling...


moreover season 3 ep 10 SVU is also wrong

and forcible oral copulation ! rape, cause you cant rape a penis

also the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics (1999) estimated that 91% of United States rape victims were female and 9% were male, with 99% of the offenders being male and 1% of the offenders being female.

Much like female erectile response and contrary to popular opinion, male erectile response is involuntary meaning that a man need not consent mentally or physically for his penis to become erect and be placed in a womans vagina. Penetration of a man by a woman is possible through use of a strapon or other object. Rape of a man by a woman could also occur when limited sexual activities are agreed upon and a mans penis is placed in a woman in violation of the limits that had been set. Rape of a man by a woman is thus possible in several ways.

I was catching up on the JL Ban on my cellphone and your comment was the only one that was whack, I culled that data in under a minute with google

20110929 19:12:18 nbsp You should be sure to contact the restaurant about that.  If its one person or two people whove multiple meals recently, thats one thing.  When its that consistent, its a really bad sign.  County environmental health would be a good call, as well. Users/TomGarberson

20111010 20:33:34 nbsp on the same token that I spoke with Stewart, try to not assume they are deleting the page cause they dislike the business, its obvious they wanted to delete the comment they made.

that is 2 people snapping at them, what does that make them think of the wiki? This is obviously someone we can get to participate in the community if it was handled correctly... Users/StevenDaubert

20111011 12:35:32 nbsp ignorance sure is bliss!

Your request came off like dickish statement, you may have not noticed it. Helpful and open isnt Dont delete the page cause you dislike a business
implying she was trying to delete the page due to the fact she had a bad experience, when it was clear (to me, and later affirmed when the came back and did it again) that they just wanted to remove the comment after getting schmeed on by 2 wikizens. Im just looking for people to gnome in a friendly open way, until malice is proven no assumed. If you had to ask I bet they were a new student (looking for non saccharine furniture) who will be in Davis awhile, and now thinks the wiki is full of people who a) dont care about her experience (in context of the other comments its believable) and b) would rather snap at her then show her the ropes

20111102 11:08:21 nbsp Thanks for the tip about the bulk food bins. Ive never bought food that way before, but Ive always wanted to get into it.

20111103 18:08:09 nbsp I am pretty sure that I didnt say that I dont want DNA in my food.  I am not afraid of science, as though GMOs were just science and as though the effects of science cant have ethical implications.  You dont get anywhere by over simplifying the other side.  Personally, I think if we dont control our population numbers we will have many worse problems than lack of food. Users/CovertProfessor

20111103 18:33:59 nbsp Agreed that there are a lot of ignorancebased reaction out there.  My feeling is to educate people about the genuine misunderstandings and then have a conversation about the rest.  I guess I can understand why you wouldnt want to discuss ethics or politics on the wiki, especially since the wiki isnt a great medium for discussion, but my view is that learning is only achieved when one hears many sides of an issue. Users/CovertProfessor

20111104 00:48:39 nbsp I agree with you.  Ive never heard any arguments based in science that would make me think that its a bad idea, although I have heard lots of arguments based on nonscience, and some based on legal issues such as intellectual property rights.

  Yes, please do. I have nothing against you being a woman (which I did not know until I clicked your link afterwards, and I have no idea about Users/MeggoWaffle) but the condescending lecturing tone you took to tell me what I meant.  I gave you the first one and responded with how I researched my position, and you left right back with further wild statements dismissing my efforts.  Inappropriate and unwelcome if you wish debate to me. Users/JeffWood

20111207 16:27:14 nbsp Hey Olivia,

Not trying to ruffle any feathers here, but I was trying to defuse the situation a bit with protest edits.  Wondering if youd be willing to pull your last comment off for a day or two until people cool off.  You can put it back later if you feel like you need to, but I was hoping for now we can take a break from it, at least for now. Users/jefftolentino

20120322 08:16:39 nbsp I havent heard of any other shops shutting down, and I have to say I dont really get it, either  Ive just heard hints from various trusted sources that WF (and maybe the lease?) has something to do with it.  Perhaps the yogurt shop was bad enough, but WF was the final straw?  Maybe they thought they would lose too many cake and packaged ice cream sales to WF?  (WF usually does have a good assortment of B&J).  Im guess, though, that there is more to the story.  Im sad about it regardless.  :( Users/CovertProfessor
