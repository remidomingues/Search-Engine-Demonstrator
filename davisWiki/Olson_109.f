Image(olson_109_2005.jpg, 500, thumbnail)  Amidst a sea of ordinary, bland classrooms in Olson Hall lies this strange gem, a magically decorated grouporiented classroom.

Once students cross the threshold into the sanctuary, they find themselves unable to look back; the window looking out into the hallway is a oneway mirror. This feeling of seclusion is heightened by the eternally closed blinds of the outer windows. The furnishings recall a lounge more than a traditional classroom. The cushioned seats match the blue scheme of the cloudy walls and oceanblue carpet, which features a brightlycolored geometric sun. The vibrantly hued room stands in stark contrast to its neighbors. The large cubbies and coatracks evoke a warm atmosphere of preschool nostalgia.

At the same time, there is a GraecoRoman influence on the room, seen especially in the shiny black columns, running trim and circular seating arrangements. While perfect for a Socratic symposium, it presents a challenge to instructors more accustomed to traditional lecture halls. In order to avoid having his back to the black board and projector, the instructor is forced to roam about the room, or more threateningly, to sit amidst his or her own students in egalitarian discussion.

There is a secret bottle of jalapeno Tabasco sauce, waiting to be discovered by a lucky student and dashed generously over his spiritless microwaved leftovers, the tears of joy running down his beard and into the steaming Tupperware.  However, to avoid the curse of Olson 109, said student must replace what is taken with a new treasure for future supplicants. Should the student fail to maintain the balance of the room by replacing the object, he will fail all of the midterms he takes in all of Olson building and wander a lonely course through pathless wastes in bitter lamentation.

Any change of objects are encouraged to be updated on this page.

20080913 21:43:41 nbsp I had to TA a class in here once.  It feels like youre on the set of a talk show for children.  Its only missing the balloons, and Im just glad the TA isnt required to wear a barney costume. Users/TheAmazingLarry

20110124 10:04:11 nbsp I have never been so confused as when I walked into this classroom. I am a junior with at least 10 classes and discussions taken in Olson and never seen this. I walked in on the previous discussion cuz I couldnt see that there was anyone in there (plus it was 9:52). I was like W…T…F… and I Davis wikid it. Does anyone have any idea why this room is here? I feel a little demeaned because it is like a daycare room. Users/MattCorey

20120111 18:00:55 nbsp This room is so weird. I booked this room for a club meeting and had a freshman flashback for an anthro section back in 2005.  I would REALLY like to know the story for this room.  Users/Babhari

This room is truly magical, I just picked up my camera there after leaving it for 24 hours and the room kept it safe! BA
