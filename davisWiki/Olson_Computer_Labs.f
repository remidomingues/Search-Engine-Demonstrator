The Olson Computer Labs (Olson 1, 15, 21, 27, 241, and 247) are computer labs located in Olson Hall.  There are a total of 6 labs.  Two of the labs are upstairs (241 and 247) and are reserved only for classrooms.  They are never open access.  The other four labs are in the basement of Olson (1, 15, 21, and 27).  Olson 15 is an open access room filled with 10minute standup stations.  The other basement labs are intended for classrooms but when there arent classes they can be opened up and made open access.  80% of the time the rooms besides Olson 15 are reserved for classes but you can check if they are open access at http://clm.ucdavis.edu/rooms/available/.  Always remember to check the signs posted outside of the door so a class isnt disrupted.
