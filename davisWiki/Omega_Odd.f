Omega Odd by Roy Bronola is a comic that runs in The California Aggie.

It is about the misadventures of Roy (hes the one with the headphones) and his crew  Ann and Damien. Though this comic primarily takes place in and around UC Davis, it oftentimes abandons concepts of space/time/reason and places its protagonists in pop culture locales. A key feature of this comic is that continuity is almostcompletely ignored in Omega Odd. Characters are dealt life changing (even ending!) experiences only to appear in the next strip as if nothing had happened.

 Reviews 

I personally think this is the best comic strip in The California Aggie the paper. Maybe its Bronolas frequent characterization of pop and geek culture (One particularly hilarious strip had Bronola in the Math Department being explained matrices by a Colonel Sandersesque man calling himself The Architect) that appeals to me. It is frequently absurd and that absurdity translates into humor. Not to mention that, as a comic, its well drawn. For example, Bronola doesnt ignore backgrounds like Gum on Asphalt other campus comics. Whats more is he often dispenses of the usual, threebox suite of comic strips for more creative geometries.

A very funny, very professional comic.  Users/JesseSingh
