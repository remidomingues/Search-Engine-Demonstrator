You might enjoy the Cops Off Campus protest currently going on in the quad. Davis cops are pretty friendly in my experience. I have seen so many times when they had the opportunity to hand out tickets but they let people go instead. Users/hankim

Also, are you aware that if your IQ scores too high you can not become a police officer?  Officer > Detective, therefore you have to have UNDER  certain IQ in order to be a detective.  When officers came after my store was broken into they didnt take prints, they took a couple of pictures, then they left.  When I called to ask what they were doing they asked me What would you like me to do?.  When my friends house was broken into the police came an confiscated more stuff.  Thats right, his house was broken into so the police came to help finish the job.

Most of my experiences with the Davis PD have been neutral, but none of them have been good and several have been quite bad.  So yeah, when I needed help the police were not there, your point has been invalidated.   Users/MasonMurray
