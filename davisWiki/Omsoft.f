Omsoft is reputed to be the best DSL provider in Davis.

Note that the reasons cited are for fairly advanced use.  If you just want to surf, play games, share files, chat through IM or voice, any provider will work fine.  Omsofts advantage lies in the fact that they give you a static IP, which basically lets you run a server (a web server, usually) over their connection a bit easier than otherwise.  They also include 10GB of usenet access per month from Giganews.

While their basic service is dynamic IP, just like everyone elses basic service, the basic static ip option is only $5 more per month. One reason for this recommendation, though, was that they had the fastest turnaround time to setup a new order. Is this still true?

  Know, however, that with the dynamic IP address scheme they will reset your connection once every 4 hours. I tried to pry an explanation out of them and only got customerspeak. They dont want you hogging an IP address (why not?) and claim that their routers need to renew their addresses or some such (maybe they should buy better routers, then?). This is a minor annoyance for most uses, but mIRC will always lose its connections (and usually fails to notice it without help), XChat does better... but if youre playing a clan match online it will probably drop you right off the server just in time to lose a close game. Dynamic IP address means that you dont necessarily get the same IP every time you dial in, it doesnt mean it has to change periodically! Id like to hear a real reason why its being done. Especially since checking my firewall logs I see the address only changed about half the time. Users/JeffreyNonken
   Hey Jeff. I had this problem as well and it was because of my router. I had to go in and manually reset my connection every four hours which was really annoying, so I called them and they gave me a static IP which never goes off. Users/ArlenAbraham arlen
   Thanks for the feedback. Just to make the point absolutely clear, the connection issue may have caused problems with your router, but your router was not causing the resets. My router/firewall happens to handle it pretty well (it even beeps to let me know). Im running http://www.smoothwall.org/ Smoothwall Express on an old PC. Anyway, I dont think they actually need to do this for technical reasons, I expect something else is going on. And Id rather not spend an extra $5/mo just to stop it. I like having a dynamic IP anyway, mostly. Moving target. :) Users/JeffreyNonken
   It turns out that if you dont have a static IP they reset the routers every 4 hours. And besides that, my MODEMs power connection was flakey. They upgraded my MODEM to the latest model for free, and I finally gave in and got a static IP. Meantime, Ive pretty much stopped gaming. :) Users/JeffreyNonken
   UPDATE (862010): I emailed Robert Nickerson (Omsoft CEO) about this issue and asked him if my DLink router will be affected. His response: That doesnt happen anymore... You get a DHCP IP for your DLink with a 12 hour lease. After which you generally get the same IP so things arent disrupted at all. Users/KevinCanlas


20050916 09:56:37 nbsp Have to say that (my dynamic IP issue notwithstanding) they got me up and running in about 4 days, 5 days sooner than they said. So far no other problems. Users/JeffreyNonken

20051129 17:54:23 nbsp A client of mine had persistent download speeds of 256Kbps when he had a 384Kbpsorbetter DSL service with Omsoft.  I measured repeatedly against various points on the net using various methods on two computers, without any SOHO routers or anything (using just the DSL bridge)  always 256Kbps.  We complained and were told that it wasnt possible that we could be having this problem, since DSL line speeds started at 384Kbps.  However, they did something because the download speeds magically improved immediately after we complained.  Unfortunately, speeds dropped again a few weeks later.  When my clients contract was up, we switched to another provider with whom we have been seeing consistent 1.5Mbps download speeds for months now.  Id prefer to stay local when the service is satisfactory, but in this case it wasnt satisfactory.  Fortunately, Sonic.net, the best ISP in Northern California, is going to start providing DSL service in this area in the next month or two. Users/GrahamFreeman

20061117 06:39:32 nbsp I think Omsoft wants to encourage people to get a static ip because DCN has a /16 so Omsoft has way more than enough. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20070827 02:35:07 nbsp hows customer service for omsoft Users/KaiWan

20070827 08:41:32 nbsp The nice thing about omsoft support is that you call and get in touch with a real live person when you call.  I had pacbell previously to omsoft for DSL and I had to wade through hours of tiersupport because I wasnt the problem (they always start by assuming you messed something up).  With omsoft, my problems are fixed quickly and they dont question my technical competence.  Now...  The downside is that they dont have 24/7 support and if your dsl line goes down late friday, you wont get it fixed until early monday.  The good news is that it doesnt do that generally anyway. Users/WesHardaker

20090312 09:23:51 nbsp I noticed their FAQ page says that you have to purchase additional IP addresses if you want more than 1 computer to be able to use the connection simultaneously. The price chart only lists a price for additional addresses for the static IP option. Does anybody know if its possible for more than 1 computer at a time to use the connection with the dynamic IP option? Users/KatieQuinn
   Yes, multiple computers can use the connection at the same time with the dynamic IP option if you use a router that does NAT. You cant throw a paperclip without hitting one at most electronics stores.

  You will need a router for multiple computers whichever way that you choose. Personally, I dont think they should charge more for additional ip addresses because they have over 65,536 of them but I havent seen a detailed report on their IP Addresses address usage. Once they get wiki:WikiPedia:IPv6 setup they will probably give everybody plenty of addresses. If you get a router that does wiki:WikiPedia:Network Address Translation then you will be able to use private ip addresses for your computers with one address from them. There are problems with this, but it is a very common setup and is the way that all the cheapest routers work. Really people just need to let them know they want ipv6. As far as I know http://www2.dcn.org/pipermail/dcntechnicalcommittee/2007November/000417.html this is as much as they have planned for it. So call them and tell them you want ipv6, they need to know people are interested.  Users/NickSchmalenberger

20091006 16:22:08 nbsp Im all for supporting locally owned businesses, but only if their service is comparable to the rest of the market. Ive gotten internet through AT&T and Comcast before, and Omsoft is miles behind them in terms of reliability. I have daily outages and the customer service support is nonexistant. Im not really a fan of Comcast, but I had far fewer outages through them. Also, AT&Ts DSL is way faster than Omsoft.  Users/DanaMace

20091006 16:37:50 nbsp Ive been using OmSoft for 4 months now.  They setup the DSL before their stated target date in an email sent to me; thus I had Internet the day I acquired the keys to my apartment.  My previous ISP was AT&T and I never really had even close to 3Mbps despite my wrangling with CSRs (who would just blame me for everything, i.e., spyware somehow operating in an Linux environment :\).  But Im not na√Øve enough to think that there is any ISP without connectivity problems from time to time.  OmSoft did have a few hickups during the last 4 months but tech support was quite prompt and didnt once insult me like AT&T generally preferred; eventually my issues were resolved and I became a happy camper.  Anyway, Ive been achieving expected speeds for 3Mbps service and upload rates are always quite stable.  For example, high quality videos play generally without a hitch providing conditions on the net are conducive to it.  If you understand the limitations of DSL, such as the http://pflog.net/dsl_overhead/ overheads involved, and the wild environs of the Internet, you can accept that problems will happen and speeds wont be perfect.  That said, my experience with OmSoft has been superlative thus far.  I just wish that their website were up with the times :) Users/RyanMikulovsky

20091007 06:30:28 nbsp In terms of reliability, I was under AT&T for about 35 years previously to Omsoft and had multiple long term outages.  During the last 57 years that Ive been under Omsoft, Ive had I think 2.  The first issue was that AT&T switched my circuit and didnt tell Omsoft, so Ill blame that one on them as well. And I honestly dont remember what the second one even was and am not positive there was one.  I work from home and am online all the time and would notice immediately if I had outages, and I never do. Users/WesHardaker

20100622 22:37:26 nbsp Thanks folks for the good words. Users/omrob

20100702 09:07:22 nbsp Love their voice message machine  Nicole (from Adobe Apartments) Teeeechhhniiicaaaal support!!! Users/NikiRose

20100904 15:50:47 nbsp Just moved to another flat.  I called Omsoft very late in the game  just a few business days before the move  and somehow they got me hooked up the day my phone got connected (at least a day before their stated minimum connection date!).  My static IP address also transferred seamlessly despite my rambling phone message.  Speaking of phones, they actually do try to get in touch with you by phone which is great when your Internet connectivity might be less than ideal.  Omsoft is a total pleasure. Users/RyanMikulovsky

20110608 21:26:37 nbsp Omsoft is great.  My business needed a rather complicated changeover from SDSL to two lines of DSL with static IP addresses to be moved with the DSL service.  Omsoft dedicated an inside engineer and an outside tech to the job and got it done in less than 1 hour.  I could not ask for better support. Users/JimStewart

20110613 10:19:55 nbsp I used Omsoft when I was a student from 1999 to 2002, and again from 2006 to 2011. Theyre great about price matching AT&T  though last I checked Omsoft didnt have the cheapest but slowest options, but really, who wants DSL that slow?. For the same price, you get fantastic customer service and you get to support a local business. Definitely going to miss them now that weve moved out of their service area. Users/JenniferKucich

20111009 20:39:09 nbsp I live here at the Lexington apartments for which Omsoft is the internet provider. I just conducted a speedtest and it literally spit out 8 kb/s. During the day it is alright (usually between 200 and 300 kb/s), but at night it is just dreadful. I think a couple paper cups with string could yield faster speeds. Users/SlowwwOmsoft

20120502 15:51:27 nbsp We are now selling Fusion, we call it http://beta.omsoft.com/Omfusion OmFusion.
Its a good deal IMO, $40 plus tax for unlimited local and long distance calling plus ADSL2+ broadband up to 20Mbps. Free Equipment lease included with service.

Takes about a week to get going.

Best speeds are in the downtown core area, or anything within about 3kfeet of the Davis CA Central Office.
Though we have people using it as far away as North Davis Farms.

As of 8/1/12 weve restructured equipment fee to a $40 refundable deposit, when equipment is returned. Users/omrob

20130110 12:45:49 nbsp I had AT&T DLS for while when I first moved to town, and later switched to Comcast. Recently my Comcast was disconnected and I was told theyd need to replace the line to my apartment before they could restore my service. After around 4 weeks of waiting and not having my calls returned I just cancelled it. AT&T said they no longer offered DSL at my apartment and Id have to buy a new modem from them for $100 if I wanted to have their upgraded service connected.

I got in touch with Omsoft and ordered their Omfusion service last Monday. I got an email the next day saying it had been processed and would working by Friday but possibly sooner, and I would just need to plug in the old DSL modem I had. I gave it a try last night (Wednesday) and it worked right away  no set up at all needed on my part. Speedtest.net reported 16 Mbs down and 1 Mbs up (a few blocks from the Coop). I tried it again right now and its reporting 13 Mbs down and 1 Mbs up  so theres a bit of variability there but its still pretty good.

I honestly couldnt be happier with them so far. Users/EamonnMurray

20131103 21:08:01 nbsp We have had Omfusion for over a year and it is far and away a fabulous deal for a landline and DSL.  The $40 gets you unlimited national calling, but on top of that the international rates are the low rates (0.040.12/min for western EU countries) that you can get with AT&T only if you pay an extra $5/mo.  Want to make lots of calls to Canada?  AT&T will give you that for an extra $6/mo, but with Omfusion it is included.  In fact, you can also call fixed lines in the UK, Australia, Brazil, South Africa and a few other places for free.  Voicemail is free too!   Users/AndrewWaterhouse

20140409 07:12:30 nbsp great company  reliable, good customer support, very knowledgeable and helpful. highly recommend. Users/farmedgirl

20140610 19:13:25 nbsp I switched my house over to Omsoft last year and could not be happier. It is the most robust internet I have ever had. The internet has only gone down once this entire year and it was only out for about 10 minutes. I fought with my xfinity connection almost every week and the service was atrocious. On top of being reliable, the internet I get from Omsoft really quick and it has plenty of power to support 4 college students who actively use the internet.
As we keep learning more about the terrible business practices of Comcast and others, Davis could not be luckier to have Omsoft. Without a doubt, everybody in this town should switch over. Users/JakeNeustadt
