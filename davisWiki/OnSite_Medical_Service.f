20090617 01:53:09 nbsp I have only the highest praise for OnSite Medical. We used them five days a week for several weeks to transport my 80 year old motherinlaw from Davis to Sacramento for chemotherapy and radiation. She was very frail and weak and had be on a gurney lying down. Every EMT was professional, careful and caring. The Director called frequently to check on my moms health and the services they were providing. We are very appreciative of this company. Users/LaurieLoving
