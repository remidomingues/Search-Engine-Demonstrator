The http://www.housing.ucdavis.edu/housing/tri_cooperatives.asp (TriCoops) housing extravaganza is the awesome coalition of three houses: Agrarian Effort (Ag), Davis Student Coop (DSC), and Pierce Coop.  At full capacity, 12 or 13 people live in each house.  The three houses are located off of Regan Hall Circle, right next to The House and the Regan Residence Halls Regan dorms.

The TriCooperatives are an interesting social experiment known as a Community.  The TriCoops are not selfsustaining, but community members do hold sustainability in high regard, growing all the food in their gardens organically and offsetting their energy consumption with solar panels.  Plans to institute a solar hot water system are currently in the works as well.  They have some gorgeous Egg Effort Coop ladies and lovely Honeybees bees in their gardens.  The gardens serve as a way to enjoy a more sustainable form of living on our fragile planet.

Community meals are held every SundayThursday at 7PM (which applicants and others are welcome to attend).  Garden parties are held every Friday from 2 until dark.

There are typically 1 or 2 spaces open every quarter, along with many more for the summer or fall seasons.  If you are interested, just come over to one of the houses and introduce yourself.  A dinner or garden party is a great place to do this.  Feel free to pick up an http://www.housing.ucdavis.edu/PDF/form_Coops.pdf application at the housing office, or go find one at our official http://www.housing.ucdavis.edu/apply/apply_coops.asp UCDavis website (sites for each coop are under construction!)

Along with the application for Student Housing, you also get to fill out this sweet questionnaire: File(tricoop_app.pdf). If youre interested, fill it out and send it to tricoop@ucdavis ASAP  the sooner we get to know you the better!

Dont forget to also check out the The Domes Domes, a unique example of an oncampus cooperative residential area, as well as other Cooperative Housing in Davis.

Residents of the coops have also been known to assist in facilitating the Sustainable Living Circus.

20091025 20:15:49 nbsp The WEF mailing list just sent out a letter stating that Student Housing wants to shut down one of the houses for budgetary reasons. The content of the letter can be read http://daviswiki.org/On_Campus_Coops/Discussion here. Users/EliseKane

20091025 21:10:08 nbsp If the students who are living in a dormitory or coop are the ones paying for it, how can something be closed for budgetary reasons? I know the dorms are in no way a good deal for students if you look at similar rooms or apartments in the area ( http://www.ucdbs.com/dorms ), so unless UC Davis is paying extra to ostensibly show how environmentallyoriented the campus is, closing the coops for budgetary reason is utter nonsense.  Users/hankim
  I have been told by some (although I do not have firsthand knowledge of this) that student housing is a revenue unit, a unit of student affairs that is intentionally run at a healthy profit margin to subsidize the rest of student affairs. If the tricoops arent that profitable for student housing to run, they may not want to deal with it.
    That makes sense, although it sounds a bit cold coming from an organization that is supposed to be helping people. Anyway, apartment complexes in the area are charging a lot less while making enough profit to bother staying in business in the area so the profit margins coming from the dorms must be quite ridiculous (especially with a monopoly on freshmen). Users/hankim
      I think youre assuming a much larger profit margin from the dorms than reality. As an aside, freshman can opt out of the dorms pretty easily.  users/edwins ES
        I do so because with how much one pays for a shared room, you could get your own room and still have money left over. Users/hankim
          Right, but the situation is completely incomparable. Most apartment complexes have one or two people manning the office and a couple handymen. Utilities and benefits are paid for by renters.  The dorms on the other hand require a fleet of custodial workers, not to mention paid RAs and supervisors.  Supplies (soap, paper towels, toilet paper, seat covers, etc) are required in massive bulk.  Even resource usage is different (people have no qualms about running the AC 24/7 for months in the dorms, whereas they wouldnt want to pay that powerbill if they rented). etc, etc.  Theres a whole lot of factors involved just with budgeting (not even looking at convenience of living on campus or other relative value).  In my opinion, simply looking at rent price versus room size cannot be a fair assessment at all. Theres quite a big difference between apartment complexes and the dorms.  And hey, it could surely go the other way, and despite the massive upkeep required by dorms, they might indeed still profit.  But without really looking at the numbers.... users/edwins ES
                          I lived in Cuarto so the cleaning, toilet paper, and whatever else the other dorms offer the residents had to buy. I believe the price is the same though. Residential Advisers are paid with a free room and a meal plan I believe. The air conditioning also can only change the temperature a few degrees, and even running the air conditioner often in a larger three bedroom apartment might run about eighty dollars a month (and this is if you have the temperature set ten degrees lower than what you can in the dorms). And the only actual additional upkeep in nonsuite dorms probably is cleaning the restrooms. Users/hankim

20091025 21:56:44 nbsp This could be because it has a mandate to house more people than it did before.  Or it could be that it wants to turn the coops into dorms that it gets more money from.  Or both. Users/IDoNotExist

  I wonder if students will get to see the benefits if the school is doing this because of the opportunity cost. Users/hankim
