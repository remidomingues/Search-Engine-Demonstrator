20071102 00:36:58 nbsp I am currently going here for some extra help in Chem 2A and Math 16A and have so far found their services to be great! The tutors are extremely knowledgeable and personable and after 2 sessions, I know that I will stick with them for a while. Prices are $30/hour for a college student tutor, $35/hour for a tutor with a BA or above.  If you are looking for a tutor, I recommend One on One. :)  Users/kthrnngo

20090602 21:41:57 nbsp I highly recommend One on One. My daughter has been tutored there once a week for 2 school years. I cant say enough about the wonderful Math tutor who helps her with her homework and test preparation. The tutor is reliable (never missed a week!) and very accomodating. She has moved the weekly appointment to better fit my daughters school schedule or occasional need for a different day. She reinforces the classroom learning and provides individualized support for specific concepts. The owners are professional, personable and very clientfocused. They strive to match tutor to student based on skills and personalities. In addition, they will do their best to accomodate short notice requests for special help for new or established students. I have nothing but positive feedback for One on One. Users/JGQ
