This is a call for youth soccer players who want to take their game to the next level.
If you are interested in participating in the One Touch Soccer Clinic, please contact me.
Once enough interest is generated, Clinic dates will be solidified and separated by age group.
(i.e. 1314 year olds on Wed. evenings / 1516 year olds on Thurs. evenings)

See the poster below for more details!
