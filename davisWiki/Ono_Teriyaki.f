20070303 11:29:50 nbsp Note: My impressions in this comment were based on my initial visit shortly after they opened.  See later comments for more recent impressions.  This place is right around the corner from where I work, and I love chicken Teriyaki, so I dropped in to try it.  All in all, very mediocre fare, but inexpensive.  I have not tried their Hawaiian food, and I will go back do so soon.  Unfortunately, this restaurant is in a cursed location, so it may not survive long.  Users/AlexPomeranz

20070305 13:24:58 nbsp I went back to this place today to check out the Hawaiian food.  The ambience has been improved a bit since I was last there, and the place was packed with new people constantly entering, so they must be doing something right.  I ordered the Kalua Pork & Pork Lau Lau dish to go.  While I have not eaten enough kalua pork to say whether this kalua pork is good by kalua pork standards, I can say that I definitely enjoyed it.  I had never had pork lau lau before, so it was a new experience for me.  I enjoyed it as well (minus the big chunk of fat I found hiding inside).  The macaroni salad that comes with the dishes has improved markedly since I was last there, and I thought the fact that they gave me a little side of teriyaki sauce to go with the rice was a nice touch.  I am now inclined to stop by this place again and try some of their other dishes. Users/AlexPomeranz

20070318 14:22:25 nbsp I tried the salmon teriyaki last week, and was disappointed.  The portion of salmon was generous, but it was very bland.  I am not sure how it was cooked, but it tasted like it had been boiled.  I got it to go, and the teriyaki sauce came in a little cup that you added at your own leisure.  Unfortunately, this just doesnt have the same effect as cooking the salmon IN the teriyaki sauce.  Consequently, it tasted like I was eating boiled salmon with teriyaki sauce dribbled on top  you can imagine the effect.  Edible, but not as good as it should be.  Probably wont get this one again.

20070320 21:02:18 nbsp Living down the street from ono teriyaki and only discovering its existents about 6 mouths ago, I’ve only whished I had discovered it sooner. I can’t say enough about the chicken teriyaki only that it is my favorite and the best I every tasted. As for the price and serving Proportions you will get no complaints from me. As well as having friendly customer service, ono teriyaki is the place to have lunch and dinner in Woodland. Users/JoseMendoza

20070414 14:31:59 nbsp One of Woodlands most delicious places to eat at very, very reasonable prices! Ive been going to Ono since the day it opened. If you love spicy food, the Thai Chicken is the way to go! Rob (the owner) has done wonders with this place! If you havent been there yet, you owe it to yourself to give it a try. You will NOT be disappointed. Users/kzh814

20070601 21:52:21 nbsp The food is pretty good.  Unfortunealty i have just been here once and only tried the spicey chicken (not spicey) and the seafood platter (pretty good).  I want to come back for the chicken/salmon/other grilled items to make fuller review (london fish and chips however, has better quality fried food).  The service was good and the people were really nice. Users/MattHh

20070602 00:19:17 nbsp I do plan on swinging by here eventually (nothing draws me up to Woodland as much as, say, Sac or Vacaville), but does anyone favor here over L&L or Ohana? For me, any Hawaiian Barbecue Hawaiian BBQ place coming to Davis would be a Very Bad Thing, since I know Id be there all the time. Users/KevinChin
  I actually perfer it to L&L, but i dont like L&L that much (their mac salad is way to mayonaisy for my tastes, and overall i find their bbq average at best) Users/MattHh

20071011 22:10:24 nbsp I had the honey chicken a few weeks ago for lunch. It was decent and they gave me a rather large portion of meat, but the macaronni salad was nothing exceptional. Probably not worth driving all the up to Woodland for, but if your in the area and hungry for something with teriyaki, I would say try Ono out. I think Ill give it one more try and test the fried calamari platter.  Users/CarlosOverstreet

20080216 03:06:49 nbsp I came here with my girlfriend this week and it was very good. We had the kahlua pork, short ribs, and the ono roll. I didnt like the flavor of the pork, but Im told that kahlua pork is just that way, so its not their fault. The short ribs had excellent flavor and the roll was very tasty also. I would definitely come here again if I was in Woodland. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20081106 22:36:30 nbsp I had the short ribs here again today and they were really good. They gave me a lot of food here, six pieces of ribs, two scoops of rice and macaroni. The owner remembered me and gave me a hawaiian donut (malasada) for free, it was great. I would probably go here again for lunch or dinner the next time I am in that part of Woodland.
