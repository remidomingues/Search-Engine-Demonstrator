Open Access Week, a global event now entering its sixth year, is an opportunity for the UC Davis academic and Research and Development research community to continue to learn about the potential benefits of Open Access, to share what they’ve learned with colleagues, and to help inspire wider participation in helping to make Open Access a new norm in scholarship and research.  from http://www.openaccessweek.org/profiles/blogs/welcometoopenaccessweek

 Open Access Week 2012 Speaker Series at UC Davis 

Open Access Week, a global event now entering its sixth year, is an opportunity to discuss and learn about the potential benefits of open access publishing. As the UC community debates open access mandates, faces federal data sharing requirements, and along with the rest of the worldwide research and academic community debates how to work with an everincreasing amount of scholarly information, Open Access Week is more relevant and important than ever.


Please join the UC Davis Library in celebrating Open Access Week 2012 with three special events:


Should You Publish in Open Access Journals?
This session will include a short introduction to OA publishing, followed by a facilitated audience discussion on the pros and cons of publishing in open access journals, led by Michael Rogawski M.D., Professor of Neurology. Bring your questions and come ready to participate!
Monday, October 22, 3:00 – 4:00 PM
Education Building Room 1204, UC Davis Medical Center Sacramento Campus map



Open data and open access:  expert panel discussion
Four experts — MacKenzie Smith (UCD University Librarian), Jonathan Eisen (UCD Professor and PLoS Biology editor), Timothy Vollmer (Creative Commons) and Carly Strasser (DataOne and the California Digital Library) will debate the merits of open access and open data and discuss recent developments in scholarly publishing and sharing data. Come with your questions for what promises to be a lively, cuttingedge discussion!

 Open Access Week 2011 Speaker Series at UC Davis 

There are four events in the library related to open access week next week: a webcast on Monday 10/24, two talks on Tuesday 10/25, and a presentation on Friday 10/28. Please join us for all or some! We hope to sponsor some more open science/open access related programs throughout the fall, as well; please let me know if you have any suggestions for speakers or programs.

Webcast on New Directions in Scholarly Communication

   • Monday, October 24, 10:00am1:00pm (see below for schedule)
   • Shields Library LIR (2nd floor instruction room, to the left as you are going up the stairs)

This webcast, sponsored by the PhysicsAstronomyMath and Academic divisions of SLA, features John Wilbanks of Creative Commons, Heather Piwowar of DataONE/Dryad, and Molly Keener, Scholarly Communication Librarian at Wake Forest University. Weve booked the LIR for the whole session; join us for all or part of this webcast.

Beyond the Impact Factor: Getting your research noticed in the algorithmic era.
William Gunn, Head of Academic Outreach for Mendeley
Tuesday October 25, 11:00am12:00pm
Shields Library Instruction Room (2nd floor)
William Gunn, Head of Academic outreach for Mendeley, will be talking about alternative metrics for research evaluation. How can individual researchers be evaluated using a broader suite of metrics than just impact factor, to a much more accurate metric of what the reseachers personal impact has been  from citations to software to data to blogs and discussions. Increasingly, the process of finding research is mediated at some point by an algorithm that sifts through the mountains of data online to deliver to a searcher what theyre looking for. Researchers need to  know how to write for the algorithmic audience and to understand the multidimensional metrics that are increasingly used to find and assess research.

Gunn has a PhD in Biomedical Sciences from Tulane, and joined the Mendeley team in 2009 to do academic community outreach. (The kind of experiences Gunn had as a working scientist, and the kinds of problems that Mendeley is trying to solve, are summed up in this blog post: http://synthesis.williamgunn.org/2009/03/18/ivejoinedmendeleyascommunityliaison/).


Workshop on Mendeley (Sacramento event)
William Gunn, Head of Academic Outreach at Mendeley
Tuesday October 25, 1:30pm2:30pm
Room 1204, Medical Education Building, Sacramento Health Sciences Campus
The Blaisdell Medical Library is hosting a workshop on Mendeley, a free reference manager and academic social network. Led by William Gunn, Head of Academic Outreach at Mendeley, it will feature a 3045 minute tutorial, with 15 minutes for questions and answers. Participants are encouraged to bring their laptops, and to come prepared with questions! If you do not already have Mendeley installed on your computer, you may do so from the following location: http://mendeley.com/download

Mendeley.com is a free, webbased reference manager platform that also enables you to annotate pdfs and to collaborate with other researchers by sharing references and forming groups. The social networking aspect of Mendeley and its ease of use make it a new kind of reference manager that is getting a lot of interest in scholarly communities.

Questions or to RSVP: contact Raquel Abad at rjabad@ucdavis.edu or 916.734.3870.
