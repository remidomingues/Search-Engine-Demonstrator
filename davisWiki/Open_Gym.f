Every Saturday 46 PM (that is, until everybody leaves/Robby needs to go), exCoach Robby opens Davis_Senior_High_School Davis Senior H.S.s New Gym for Badminton.  You can borrow Robbys rackets and shuttlecocks, but please put them away neatly, birdies in the can, rackets in the bag or the badminton team will hear about it...

If you want to save your court while going for a water break, and no ones saving it for you, LEAVE a racket on the court.

At 6 at least half the courts are taken down and the basketball hoops are let down.  Bring your own basketball basketballs.
