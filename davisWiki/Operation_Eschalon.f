Apparently a group that took down every flier in Wellman hall, sometime on the night of February 12, 2007, leaving a single flier in its place.
The flier they left read that the board had been closed, and proceeded to quote Simon and Garfunkles Sound of Silence, as well as listing the SPAC rules for posting on the boards.
The motives, membership, and well anything about them is pretty much a blank. The name is most likely a reference to this http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/RANCHO/POLITICS/ECHELON/echelon.html.

Possible Suspects:
  LEAD  Seems unlikely as lead fliers missing.
  Student Focus  Seems unlikely as Focus Fliers were missing.
  Steve Ostrowski  Seems unlikely as fliers were free of spelling errors, reference to empires or conspiracies.
  Fraternities  Seems unlikely as fraternity and Focus fliers were removed.
  Campus Crusade for Chaos and Confusion  Seems unlikely, missing iteration number etc.
  Rob Roy
  This doesnt make sense.  Users/ArlenAbraham
   Why doesnt it make sense?  Dont hide the truth man, just because you want more people to not vote for you!  Users/BrentLaabs
  Students for an Orwellian Society  Seems unlikely, organization thought dead.
  CCCC or SOSSS copy cats.
  Renegade art student  Suggested by James, possible...
  Janitors  It is their job kinda?
  SPAC  This organization rarely acts in such a manner, also they would probably charge fees for violations.
  R4 Recycling  Im pretty sure its this one, because the fliers had R4 logos on them. But, this would probably also go under CCCC / SOSSS copycats.
  The Davis Enforcer  Unlikely due to lack of bungling, but then again they did release an issue the following day.
  Freshman  There is some recyclemania going on or something, could be related?


Please note, every flier was removed, not a single flier remained in the hall, which was already a bit empty of fliers in the first place on this day (example, Young Hall was absent its usual flier filled board.), this suggests that this is the second not the first event.
