Operation: Restore Maximum Freedom (O:RMF) is a nonprofit all ages DIY music festival put on roughly twice a year by KDVS 90.3FM in Davis. This event has a rich history of bringing killer audio projects from the radiowaves of KDVS to the soundwaves of Plainfield Station, the venue chosen for its awesome burgers, cheap beer, and rural location in the middle of Yolo county. The music is still healthy in Sacto/Davis, where KDVS DJs fight the good fight against corporate hegemony of homogeny. Using freeform radio and a grand variety of live shows, we bring the best tunes to the region, as we have for decades.

In todays Davis Politics political climate, while personal freedoms have been undermined by the current regime, one studentrun, communitypowered radio station has endeavored to make the most of what freedom is left; Freeform KDVS 90.3 FM in Davis has chosen to support the new, creative music of the most sincere artistic scruples, thereby offering a true, outstanding alternative choice to music fans who refuse to settle for less. For people whove grown weary of corporatecontrolled rebellion and partying in bars with bros brodawgs and hoochiemamas  where every flash of the horns and socalled act of revelry is so formulaic and seemingly scripted  Max Freedom offers you a totally different way to parties party.

Plainfield Station is located at 23944 County Road 98, just across the bridge at the intersection of Road 98 & 29. Technically part of Woodland, it’s closer to Davis. From Davis, take 5th street/Russell blvd west, then turn right on Road 98 and travel north. From I80, take 113 north, then Road 29 west. Grill and beer bar, so bring cash for chow and cheer. If you don’t have a car, how the hell are you going to get out there? Easy. Tough up and ride your bike on the 5th street route, its only a few miles  if youre not afraid of the people driving home from the bars at 10PM...

20060531 12:55:40 nbsp Anyone carpooling to this? (Or does everyone bike home from Woodland at midnight?) Users/SteveDavison
  Perhaps freedom to get there/back safely isnt included.
  Why not have a shuttle bus for this? Just flash your concert ticket/stub and ride beteen the MU and Plainfield Station. (There was a 25cent bus taking people from the Domes to the Cannery last night, and this is further, later, involves alcohol, and is on highspeed bikelaneless roads.) I guess well just have to have a death to get this implemented; volunteers? Users/SteveDavison

20060531 13:19:41 nbsp Its not uncommon for people to ride their bikes. Last year some guys rode their bikes from Oakland. Users/ArlenAbraham
  Biking home from a bar(!) at night(!!) on a poorly lit road(!!!) with anemic bike lanes(!!!!) sounds like just about the unsafest thing ever. Users/TravisGrathwell
     To be fair, he didnt say it was a good idea, just that its not uncommon. Its not uncommon for people to get drunk at bars and drive home either. Since Im not trying out for the Darwin award at this time, I think Ill pass on the bike suggestion. Users/SteveDavison
        As far as bike safety is concerned, I know that the people from the Bay Area, Sacramento, and Davis who biked to the event numbered in the 20 range, and they all made it home safe without incident. The entire Davis bike contingent looked like an honesttogoodness peloton when I passed them on Road 29 at approximately 12:20 a.m. They had plenty of flashing lights, reflective fabrics, and safety in numbers. It looks like biking to Max Freedom will be a strong tradition as long as there is a Max Freedom.

20060601 01:43:22 nbsp question: is it $7 for students for both advance ticket purchases and at the door, or does the student rate only apply if students purchase in advance? Users/EliseKane
  Seems pretty clearly stated that its $7 for students either way. Therefore students would have no advantage in getting advance tickets, except if there was a possibility of selling out. For nonstudents, the price nearly doubles (why so steep?!). Users/SteveDavison
   I think everyone knows that the Plainfield Station wont sell out (they claim their backyard has a capacity of 700+), but some students do buy advance tickets if only so that we may have some momentum going into the event. For those of us organizing and working the event, advance ticket sales revenue greatly helps us to have a slush fund for lastminute needs, change for the door, and a good guage as far as how many people will eventually show up. This time, we had double the advance ticket revenue at the beginning. Three bands were able to be paid before we even welcomed one guest at the door. It gave us a sense of relief that the hard work would inevitably pay off, and we would not be forced to pay bands out of our own pockets.  It is strange to me, however, that the price for this event might be considered steep.  That we can do these festivals for so little money is actually just short of miraculous to me.  This was 13 bands of quality and variety happening in a unique setting right in our own backyard.  Meanwhile, the Heritage Festival was happening a few miles away...it, too, was an allday music event in a parklike setting. It cost $35 and featured Jackie Greene, Mumbo Gumbo, and a host of smoothed out blues and smoothed out jazz bands from the local area. Cigar bar fare.  And, really, when you compare it to a lot of allday music festivals, $35 is on the cheap side.  In any event, were really happy that so many people came to O:RMF III.  We had an estimated 340 people there, plus 48 musicians...nearly 400 people took that portapotty #1 to the limit. The bands seemed really happy with the fans and Plainfield.  We feel like O:RMF III gives us the momentum to make O:RMF IV the best time yet.  Stay tuned here for more info on that as it develops.  Thanks! Users/RickEle

20061004 13:16:52 nbsp Maximum Freedom IV is seriously one of the best music festivals on the west coast this year.  For the price, great quality of diverse acts, and real noncorporate b.s., nothing beats it. Users/BrendanBoyle

20070603 15:07:53 nbsp What a great time! Thanks for the shuttle, too! ORMF is further proof that Davis beats the Bay Area hands down.  Users/NoahPretentious

20120426 17:29:32 nbsp ORMF 12 is announced! Lineup above. May 19, 2012. SHOW YR PRETTY FACES Users/SharmiBasu
