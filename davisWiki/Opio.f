20080904 09:54:53 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy, Mr. or Ms. Pio, and Welcome to the Wiki!   You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you (or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here).

You duplicated it on the Talk page (which is a temporary space just for communicating about how to write the entry), so I deleted that and folded the changes back into the main entry.  If you have any questions, just ask... and you can check out our informal, community written guide for business owners by Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner clicking here.
