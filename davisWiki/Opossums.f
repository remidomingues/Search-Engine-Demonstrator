One of the more robust town fauna backyard visitors is the opossum (Didelphis virginiana). Often in search of cats cat food left out, they are often noticed by the volume with which they chew dry cat food. Opossums will establish a territory and a route that they will follow. They are not frightened easily and will stand their ground and hiss loudly if cornered. Opossum literally means white animal.  They are doubly unique in that they are the only North American marsupial and also the only mammal to have a prehensile tail.

Opossums very rarely carry rabies because of their unusually low (for mammals) body temperatures. However, they are known to carry diseases like leptospirosis, tuberculosis, relapsing fever, tularemia, spotted fever, toxoplasmosis, coccidiosis, and trichomoniasis.  They are generally not particularly dangerous compared to most wild animals.  Having an opossum about is actually a very effective way to eliminate the Slugs & Snails snails from ones garden.

Opossums can be domesticated and potty trained.  It is recommended that you do not try this with an adult opossum, but if one finds an injured baby opossum, nursing it back to health and either keeping it as a pet or shleffing it off to someone else as a pet (your benevolent attention may have rendered it unqualified for the rough life of the Davis urban wilds) might be a larf.  Once you run out of snails to feed them, they also like hardboiled eggs.  Users/KrisFricke Kris Fricke once had a pet opossum.

Note: possum is a regional shortening of opossum.
  I dont think this is true.  Where is the proof for this?  I think people are just confused on how to spell it in N. America. Users/NiareeHopelian
    For one reference, check out the http://dictionary.reference.com/search?qpossum American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language entry for possum.  They label it as being Chiefly Southern U.S.  Though these regional shortenings often come about, at least in part, because of a disregard/ignorance of the pronunciation reflected in the proper spelling.

UC Davis and opossums
UC Davis is an active place for those who care about opossums. The Opossum Society of the United States, in Irvine, CA, boasts members from the UC Davis Vet school and sometimes hosts events and workshops at UC Davis. For more information on all things opossum, http://opossumsocietyus.org their website is a helpful resource.

20050123 22:55:32 nbsp I once killed a possum by accidentally running it over whilst riding my bike at night. It was both scary and sad. Users/PaulLanzi

20050123 23:45:51 nbsp Maybe the possums around here are smaller or something, but I have scars that dispute the are not particularly dangerous.  Ever see what their mouth looks like open?Users/JabberWokky

20050124 02:38:44 nbsp There aint no one who dont call em possums! Users/BrentLaabs

20050124 13:50:47 nbsp Yes I am have seen what theiri mouths look like open  they have sixty teeth.  Ive even received some friendly gnaws from my pet possum. Users/KrisFricke

20050302 20:25:35 nbsp An opossum is a wild animal. Keeping one as a pet is illegal under the CA Fish & Game Code.  Users/LornaBernard
  Yeah, but the CA DFG thinks that ferrets are also wild animals, and has banned them as well. Considering how darn tame ferrets are, I think that the DFG doesnt have much moral authority here. Considering how many happy (but paranoid) ferret owners there are out there, Id say youre in good company owning a pet banned by the CA DFG. Users/EricKlein
   I think the CA DFC is more worried about potential ferret escapes wreaking havoc on the local bird and amphibian population, in a similar fashion that the mongoose is in Hawaii. Though you could make the same statement about feral cats. Users/MatthewTom
     Im willing to make that assertion about outdoor domestic cats too. They are well known to devastate local wildlife. And yes the CA DFG regulations are about preventing invasives from causing a large amount of damage if accidentally released (Not all pet owners are responsible, hence the SPCA). Well known examples of this phenomenon: Red Eared Sliders, European Starlings... Users/AlexMandel

20050609 13:47:24 nbsp Ugg! How about some respect for the opposums! Our only marsupial! Expect a new properly named page with pictures of nondead opossums and useful information and links soon... Users/MarieBoisvert

20050610 03:46:16 nbsp There are two cohorts of marsupials: Australidelphia and Ameridelphia.  The common name for opossums in America is opossum and in Australia is possum.  This is to distinguish between the two cohorts and the distinct species they contain. They are both pronounced the same, so it all boils down to spelling. If you want to get technical, this page and all the references within should be renamed opossum.Users/NiareeHopelian

20050613 09:50:51 nbsp oh, possums Users/ArlenAbraham

20050613 10:59:01 nbsp Interestingly enough, when I check in my dictionaries, the entries for opossum include a different pronunciation than possum.   Users/JevanGray

20050815 19:52:53 nbsp The clicking possum came back last night.  Users/JeffreyNonken was awakened by the clicking at some godawful hour, woke up our older daughter and they ran outside to play with the little guy.  A fine time was had by all except our 9 year old who was having a nightmare about pizza. Users/BlancheNonken

20051229 12:37:35 nbsp Opossums very rarely carry rabies because of their unusually low (for mammals) body temperatures. However, they are known to carry diseases like leptospirosis, tuberculosis, relapsing fever, tularemia, spotted fever, toxoplasmosis, coccidiosis, trichomoniasis, and Chagas disease. They are also carriers of fleas and lice. Possum Pete hangs out in our back yard. I like to watch it, but I would never think of touching it! Users/AnaluciaCordova

  Chagas disease, or American Trypanosomiasis, a protozoan disease, can only really be vectored mammals through true bugs of the family Reduviidae, and the subfamily Triatominae. This is because the parasite needs to complete its life cycle in the bug. Unless you live in a thatched roof building infested with Reduvid bugs, you dont have to worry about Chagas disease.  Users/MatthewTom

20091118 10:40:10 nbsp I love oppossums and thought I was the only one! I assisted an injured baby one back to healthit would sneak into our cat door around 10pm and make a bline for under our bed. I noticed a gash on its head and started to put yogurt and catfood under there w/ a heating pad and bedding. It never peed or pooed or whatever and it always respectfully left by the time we woke up. It just needed a place to chill for a few weeks rather than be roaming about all night. The gig was up when it tried macking a bowl of ice cream on my bedside table....then i moved the bedding and everything to the covered back porch and it visited regularly. Happily ever after.

20131030 05:04:46 nbsp I guess I have an illegal pet then..... I am in California and have a possum, her name is puddle. So cute.... And she is a baby.... Even more cute.
