Outreach/Preview Day/Picnic Day
  Oct 21st: Preview Day. Members from the Optics Club were in The Pavilion at UC Davis showcasing the Optics Club and offering information about the OSE program. There they also talked about geometrical optics, diffraction gratings, lasers, polarizers and the annual Laser Maze held during Picnic Day.
  Feb. 24th: The Explorit Center, Davis,CA.
  April 7th: Members built a float to promote the UC Davis Optics Program. The float was supposed to represent a laser engraving machine, a play on words of the Picnic Day theme Make your mark.
  April 7th: UC Davis Welcome Week. Members of the Optics Club promoted the Optical Science and Engineering undergraduate program. Members also explained basic optics prinicipals and displayed a miniature laser maze.
  April 14th: Laser Maze for UC Davis’s Picnic Day. Approximately 500 people ran through the maze this year.<

Everyone Loves Our Laser Maze

The laser maze is a music integrated laser system built for UCD hosted or sponsored events. Its components are a CD player, a longrange low power laser diode with modulator, a series of reflective mirrors, a detector, and regular music speakers.

Simply put, the laser maze is more like an obstacle course than a maze. The iPod sends a digital signal to the laser diode through a standard audio cable. The music is then converted to a modulated AM signal with a modulator custom made by UCD students.  Once the signal is converted, it is integrated into the beam and dispersed across the room. The beam is reflected off a series of mirrors that are strategically placed at different locations and heights on both sides of a marked off corridor around the room.  The corridor is for volunteers to walk, crawl, or roll through with the goal of making it to the end without getting in the way of any of the reflected beams. The last mirror in the series sends the light into a converging lens that focuses the beam onto a photodetector that converts the AM signal into analog.  The converted signal is then sent to a set of speakers with another audio cable. If a volunteer steps in the way of the beam, the signal to the photodiode will be broken and the music will stop playing. To aid the volunteers with their goal, a fog machine is used to refract a small part of the beam and make it slightly easier to get around.

Laser maze always draws huge crowds every year at Picnic Day (UCDs open house) and just recently we have started bringing a scaleddown version to our Outreach events to demonstrate to students fun and inventive ways of using optics.


Outreach


The purpose of this program is to demonstrate the use of Optics and its practical applications in communication, imaging, computers, even Hollywood! to local Colleges, High School, and Middle School students.  To have the Optics Club come to your school, simply email the Outreach Chairs, or any one of us and well get back to you shortly.

Some experiments are (but are not limited to):

  physical optics  using various concave, convex and Fresnel lenses, we illustrate the basics of physical optics such as the focal point, radius of curvature, converging and diverging rays, and ray tracing. Students will have a chance to look through each lens and see how light travels through it.

  michelson interferometer  An ether is essential for the propagation of a wave... or is it?  Water waves propagates by water, sound waves propagate by air, is it essential then, for light waves to propagate through a certain medium as well? We answer this with the help of our Michelson Interferometer, and demonstrate the Interferometers application in the industry.

  waveguides with jello molds  We make a shallow dish of jello ahead of time, cut strips of jello to demonstrate how waveguides work  need the light to go from a higher index medium to a lower index medium in order to have total internal reflection . In the case of jello, jello has the higher index of refraction than light so the beam of light propagates internally throughout the jello  like fiber optics! This also works with continuous streams of water and a laser pointer.

  polarization  We have two identical square sheets of polarizers from our optics suitcase  line them up and show how we can look through. Slowly turn them perpendicular to one another and watch the kids go ooh and aah while watching the polarized squares go dark. Then, put another smaller square of polarized material in the middle at a 45 degree angle and show that that they can see through that small window even though nothing else can be seen through the other polarizers. We will draw out how it works with simple diagrams and demonstrate usefulness with sunglasses and LCD phone or computer screens!

  Laser Maze  Everyones favorite. (see section above)
