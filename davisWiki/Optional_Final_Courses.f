A slackers list of courses that, for some reason or another, have an optional final, allowing you to cut out on finals week completely. I plan one day to have a schedule filled with optional final courses, none of which I will take. In my experience, these seem to follow the three midterm, one final pattern, with the lowest score dropped, so a missed final is automatically dropped.

 Courses 
FST 010  3 midterms, 1 final, lowest score dropped
PSC 001  3 midterms, 1 final, lowest score dropped
