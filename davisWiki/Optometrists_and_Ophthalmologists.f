If Davis is a blur to you, maybe you need glasses, contact lenses, or other eye care.  Most people go to optometrists, but others go to ophthalmologists.  An optometrist has a Doctor of Optometry degree (O.D.  Oculus Doctor) from an optometry school, generally including four years of postgraduate work.  An ophthalmologist, on the other hand, is a medical doctor with an M.D. (Medicinae Doctor) degree.
