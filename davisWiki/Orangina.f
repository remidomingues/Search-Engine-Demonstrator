Some refer to this as the best nonAlcohol alcoholic bottled drink in existence.  Its carbonated, contains real orange pulp, and it usually comes in a strangely shaped little bottle.  Part of the fun is that you dont get __nearly__ enough.  Its also fun to sex pronounce the name.

Though the word Orange is in the name, the juice itself is actually yellow.

 Places to find it 
  Aggie Student Store  Its quite cheap!
   Users/JevanGray, you say they didnt have it?  Unless you asked (and maybe even if you did), it might have been in the back.  As far as I know, they hardly ever stock the front of the store.  I will also ask Kai SavareeRuess The Kai about it.

A few years ago I read somewhere that Coca Cola tried to buy Orangina but the French government would not allow it. Users/EdPereira

Well, there is its competitor (unless theyre owned by the same company) aranciata. I always pronounce it Orangeeeena ... but sometimes I think its fun to call it Orangeyena ... like the vagina of an orange.  S

20051227 16:40:29 nbsp The thing about Aranciata is that it doesnt even have a twistoff bottle top. You have to get a bottle opener!  S

20060707 01:55:48 nbsp I found this stuff at some little Mexican food place between here and Santa Cruz. Soooo goooood. And I dont even like orange juice. Also Safeway Vacaville here sells this wonderous juice. Users/MichelleAccurso
