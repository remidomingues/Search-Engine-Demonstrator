 Information 

Orchard Park is one of two campusmanaged apartments apartment complexes located on campus (the other is Solano Park).  Apartments are tiny (594 square feet), very basic, and inexpensive, but the complex has a large courtyard and two playgrounds for children as well as laundry facilities and a community center available to all leaseholders. If you have children, both Orchard and Solano Parks are nice because there are so many other people with children; neighbors often help each other out with babysitting and the http://www.housing.ucdavis.edu/Current/Parks/default.htm community offers lots of afterschool programs to entertain kids and provide family support. There is a nearby Child Development Center that may offer a discount to families living in either Orchard or Solano Park. Only two bedroom apartments are available. The waiting list is prioritized in the following order:

 1. Students with children,
 2. Married students/domestic partnerships (documentation required)
 3. Graduate students with no children,
 4. Undergraduate students with no children

Orchard Park was built in 1964. In the next year, residents will be moved to Solano Park as Orchard Park buildings are replaced, with everyone moving out by July 31, 2014. Until that time, there may be increasing numbers of vacancies. The residents will then be moved back to the new Orchard Park, and Solano Park will be retired, July 31, 2016.

There is an Orchard Park Garden, like the Solano Park Gardens, but it was abandoned in favor of the Experimental College Community Garden the EC Garden in 2005. In 2011, a brave group of residents are resurrecting the expansive, but overgrown garden. Plots are $30 for a whole, $20 for a half, larger and cheaper than the EC Garden.

20090420 21:24:27 nbsp Are pets really prohibited at Orchard Park? Or rather, is that policy enforced? Im hoping to move to Davis with two very small dogs, but am having trouble finding places that allow dogs. Users/harvardslacker

20140122 19:58:03 nbsp I heard they were completely tearing down this place, including the childrens park that is located in the complex. Ive heard that they will be erecting a new apartment complex that is not affiliated with the University. I am so sad to see the actual park go. It had the best swings and a really cool rope climber. Im surprised no one else has written anything here. Users/jenb
