The http://telperion.info Order of Telperion is a mystical knighthood, based in Davis and not at all connected to the local fraternity called Alpha Gamma Omega. All that is done by the Order is secret, except for that which is not secret; regardless, all is done in the appropriate manner, which, incidentally, is secret. Sorry. None of Telperions members have ever been a part of Campus Crusade for Chaos and Confusion and certainly do not recommend that you Steal Bainer Hall this Building.
