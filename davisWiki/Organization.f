 Three Points to Remember 
The Wiki is a fun and fluid place that always has a lot going on and many different opinions on pretty much any topic that comes up.  It can take a little getting used to.  Here are three key points you should bear in mind while joining the Wiki community and interacting with your neighbors here:

 1. Organization pages belong to the Davis community, not to the organization.  Like every other page on the wiki, theyre written collaboratively by many members of the community.  Rather than trying to maintain a neutral, objective point of view, the Wiki tries to represent many different points of view.  You have more knowledge about your organization than anyone else out there so your perspective is extremely valuable, but remember that yours is just one among the many voices contributing to the page.  Each editor (including you!) has equal say over the pages form and content.
 1. Organization pages should be informational, rather than promotional, in tone.  They should be written from the communitys point of view (third person: They rather than we or I).  This means that organization pages, like every other page around here, will retain history documenting the organization, the location, events, and all sorts of connections within the community.  Deleting information, unless its outright wrong, is frowned upon.  Likewise for photos  theyre a part of that history!
 1. Try to respond positively to negative comments.  People will inevitably leave negative comments sooner or later.  Look around at any organization page on the wiki; theyve all got them.  Dont delete themit can look like youre trying to cover something up.  Just take a deep breath and remember that people sometimes forget that those who are part of an organization have feelings and write things theyd never be willing to say in person.  Try to address the problems they raise in a friendly, constructive way.  This is your chance to tell your side of things and show everyone how your organization handles the inevitable conflicts that can occur in any organization.

 I need help / Somethings incorrect! 

First read and understand the three points at the top of this page.

If somethings incorrect, you can fix it!  If you think people might have questions or not understand, use the edit comment bar at the bottom of the editing window to explain (theres a short character limit, so keep youll have to keep it brief).  Beyond that, you can easily ask for help from other editors by creating a Talk page (its easy  details on the Wiki Community/Seeking Help Seeking Help page).

 Conflicts 
If you run into disagreements with other editors, look to the advice on the Wiki Community/Handling Problems handling problems page.

 Handy Links
