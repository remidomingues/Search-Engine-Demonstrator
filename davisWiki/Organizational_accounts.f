Organizational accounts are communal accounts created for members of an organization to use to make edits to that organizations page. Examples include Users/UrbanBodyStaff, Users/HealthEducationPromotion, and Users/WillowsManagement and Users/willows. We have been seeing more and more of these accounts as of late. While it has been my feeling that these accounts are a bad thing, to the best of my knowledge, weve never discussed the issue in great detail nor have we /Disable discussed how to deal with it.

/List List of Organizational Accounts  prepared a while ago so out of date
/Abuse Linked edit histories that demonstrate a pattern of abuse
/Disable Disable  the proposal to disallow these accounts

 Argument Against 

I believe that the problems with such accounts are numerous. Here are just a few of the problems Ive thought of.

  Such accounts lack individual accountability. Individuals should have their own accounts so that each individual editor is responsible for their own edits.
  Such accounts go against the general principles enumerated at the Importance of using your RealName.
  Such accounts discourage editors from editing pages that have nothing to do with their organization. We want editors to be part of our editing community, not just curators of their organizations page.
  Such accounts may cause some editors to give unnecessary deference to the organization when it comes to contentious edits. This may undermine the general principle of community ownership of the wiki.

As of right now, I am in favor of adopting a policy that states that these accounts should be disallowed. However, I recognize that we havent had any major problems with such accounts and such a measure may be drastic and alienating. I also recognize that perhaps the problems Ive listed arent really problems.

Does anyone have any other thoughts on the matter? Responses to my thoughts?  Users/WilliamLewis

 Large business perspective 

Please understand that our reason for using a business name because it is very important for us to do what is respectful and appropriate in a community based web setting. We have set up this account with a business name to avoid the mingling of personal opinions which don’t belong linked with our general apartment updates. As apartment management staff members, we work hard to keep our “work” opinions general. For example at work, we don’t evoke personal religious opinions, as doing so might be seen as a way of isolating renters with other such opinions. I fear that by forcing us to use individual names for apartment updates, you will remove our ability to contribute open opinions on other matters in our free time. I believe the user CovertProfessor uses a name other than his own for a similar reason. I’m confused as to why the same understanding cannot be expressed to us. Users/ChautauquaManagement

 Response to large business perspective 

The reasons for businesses wanting anonymity may be somewhat similar, but in practice, organizational accounts are very different from other anonymous accounts.  For one, the organization accounts are not tied to any one person.  I am one person; I imagine that anyone who has read enough of what Ive written can tell that its all been written by the same person, and those who have wanted to get in touch with me by email have been able to do so.  Without an account being tied to one person, there is no accountability.  Weve even had cases in the past where people used organization accounts without in fact reflecting the opinion of the business.  This is something that businesses shouldnt want, either.  Another difference is that most nonorganizational anonymous users edit many sorts of pages.  I think by now I have edited just about every type of page that the wiki has: pages about restaurants, pages about parks, pages about politics, etc., etc.  I am not here to promote a business, which of course violates the wikis nonprofit status.  I interact with other editors as an individual and work with them to find solutions when there are disagreements.  I dont just pop in here to promote my own interests and then pop out.   Users/CovertProfessor


20090402 10:27:29 nbsp I like the idea of a role account such as this.  The problem, of course, is that there is no way to tell whether or not the account is actually related to the business it purports to be related to.  For example, if I created an account called BobsShoeAndTroutEmporiumManagement, you might think that I was the manager of Bobs shoe and trout emporium, even if I am not.  Or maybe you once worked for Bob and had the password to that account, but Bob fired you after that late night trout snorting incident that he caught on camera.  You then might use the account to hurt Bobs business.

One possibility would be to create accounts that can only edit a SPECIFIC page, and to give those accounts a management name.  But of course, theres still the problem of not knowing who is actually using the account.  There might also be liability for the wiki if someone got a management only account that they shouldnt have, and used it to damage a business.  (You should ask the legal experts on the wiki if that is actually an issue.) Users/IDoNotExist

20090402 12:48:26 nbsp Maybe Wiki Spot should provide free personal accounts, but start charging for corporate accounts. Users/BrentLaabs

20090402 18:00:47 nbsp In the same way that not using a Importance of using your RealName real name to post under, or at least putting together a fleshed out personal page, is like wearing a ski mask to a social gathering; using a Role account is like wearing a uniform. The problem with uniforms is that anybody can put one on and impersonate the owner of a business, city official, or other role. Id rather that the wiki didnt have to focus on validating either names or roles and could just be a place for people to come and build a helpful resource for the whole community. Users/JasonAller

20090403 08:28:10 nbsp I think it should be be generally discouraged, but I have no big problem with it.  Weve seen a few cases where people get in trouble at their place of work for responding or commenting on their business pages, and in that situation, at least a Role account shelters them a little and gives them a chance to respond from the proper role. Theres similar positive aspects of it, and I definitely think, for example, the HealthEducationPromotion account is Aok.  Some level of anonymity for some of that stuff is more than understandable.

The apartment complex manager accounts Im more iffy about, mostly because some of them crossedit due to sharing owners/management, and I think down the road it could potentially become a problem if they sit to nurse their own pages. Overall, I think the best thing to do is simply ask that the people behind a role account recognize the differences between the two types of accounts.  We can ask that they also join and contribute on a more personal level, but I think that most people will realize how quick/easy it is to make an account (since they just did it...) and if they want to contribute at some point beyond their work priorities, they will.  Otherwise, unless it starts to become a problem, I dont think we have yet need to try to preemptively weedem out.  Users/EdWins

20090403 18:05:06 nbsp I like the idea us allowing, even encouraging these accounts.  Of course real names are good, but when a business owner is speaking on behalf of the business, I want to be able to associate the user account with the business.  Sometimes owners comment on reviews on their pages, and you have to interpret from the context or other posts that it is in fact the owner, but its not always clear.  In these cases, it is effectively the business talking anyway.  Im reading the reviews and comments to decide whether to give the business my custom, not whether to make friends with the owner.

If you want the actual name of the owner, isnt this a matter of public record?  We can get it if we need it, but 99% of the time, knowing that the owner is posting in the interest of the business by using the business name just things more clear.  Its not the same as hiding behind some other anonymous username because the interests of the owner are the same as the interests of the business, so theres no ambiguity.  Sure, its possible to fake it or for rogue employees to misrepresent the business, but dont we have other ways to deal with this?   Its possible to do that now, but Im not aware of this being a problem.  We could just reserve the username of the business for the owner, and if the owner disputes ownership of the account, we can figure out how to resolve it, otherwise assume that the business name account is the owner.

20100109 09:26:39 nbsp Im not in favor of the organizational accounts.  Didnt we see an instance recently with one of the ISPs where an employee used an organizational name, only to have the owner say that the employee didnt speak for the company?  It was a bit of a mess.  And it is clear that when people create those accounts, they dont intend to fully participate in the wiki.  All they do is hover over their page, watching for any change and pouncing if they dont like it. Users/CovertProfessor

20100109 09:40:16 nbsp I am of the opinion that all accounts belonging to commercial entities run afoul of Wiki Community/For Profit Restrictions as they, by their very nature, engage in the promotion of their business and dont contribute to the community in any other way. Users/WilliamLewis

20100109 10:58:49 nbsp Im going to start inviting editors using Organizational Accounts to start closing their accounts and opening new ones using their real names as I see them edit. I still need to improve the language of that invitation and make sure that the instructions for closing the old account dont make it hard for them to open a new one. I suggest that several of us try to come up with such language and see if we cant reach the point at which we have pretty good instructions. good pages to link them to are Welcome to the Wiki, Importance of using your RealName real name, Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner. Users/JasonAller
  My default base message in cases like these will be something like:
  Please close this account and edit under your Importance of using your RealName real name. Instructions on how to do so are on the Importance of using your RealName page. There has been discussion about people using Wiki Community/Organizational accounts organizational accounts and since Wiki Spot, who hosts Davis Wiki, got their 501(c)(3) status there have been some restrictions about Wiki Community/For Profit Restrictions promoting for profit businesses. We welcome your input, but prefer that you do so using an individual account rather than an organizational one. If you havent read Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner, please do so.
 Users/JasonAller

  Id definitely leave out the reference to 501(c)3 status, etc.  That could easily confuse someone into thinking they cant contribute information about their business.  Id be very careful about that in general.  I did some work rewording the guideline (http://wikispot.org/Community_Guidelines#PROMOTE here) which hasnt been reflected on the corresponding Davis Wiki page yet.  Id just tell people to please create a new account with their real name and use that instead.  I disagree with William that using an organizational account runs afoul of the new guideline, but Id encourage folks to use accounts under their real names just for encouraging broader participation & community.

 Re: org accounts & guideline  an org account is identification, not promotion.  In some ways these accounts make bias easier for casual editors to see, so theres positives here too.  Users/PhilipNeustrom
  Here is the revised version:
  Please close this account and edit under your Importance of using your RealName real name. Instructions on how to do so are on the Importance of using your RealName page. Wiki Community/Organizational accounts Organizational accounts pose several problems, but the core issue is that they detract from a sense of community when one or more people use the name of an organization. This leads to a sense of faceless, impersonal action rather than the actions and statements of a member of the community. As a member of the Davis community, your contributions are very much appreciated, but it would be better if you make them using your name rather then the name of your organization. If you havent read Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner, and Wiki Community/For Profit Restrictions please do so. Users/JasonAller
    Im not sure if this puts this in a way that will be persuasive to a business owner or employee.  It might be better to point out that organization accounts make them seem as though they are a different sort of editor from other editors (perhaps with more authority to edit their page, which is not the case) and that from the point of view of their own selfinterest, responding with a name appears much more personal and caring.  (Think how often customer service emails are signed with a name these days).  cp

20100109 20:16:44 nbsp These accounts are a Bad Thing. But they do less harm than the myriad nonaccountable and oftentimes irresponsible anonymous posters that are attracted to the wiki.  Both problems need to be fixed, not just the easy one. Users/JimStewart
  (As a side note, I agree with you Jim, but this particular one is a more directly addressable issue, and correcting one thing out of several is better than none at all (assuming the zeitgeist is that it needs correcting). jw)

20100128 11:58:29 nbsp I think we may be causing unnecessary drama with the insistence that folks using these accounts start editing under their real name.  Perhaps a bit of forceful encouragement with some explanation (which was lacking in the messages left today) would be more helpful.  We havent had any actual issue with any of these accounts, as far as I know.

They leave a bad taste in my mouth, but I recognize that businesses dont want employees speaking on behalf of their organization.  But we have to remember the goal here: to help improve some of the dynamics of the wiki.  Causing lots of people to get upset or confused obviously wont help, and forcing an organization, against their will, to stop using their organizational account may just prompt them to stop contributing. Users/PhilipNeustrom
   I follow the rule of thumb that they should be discouraged socially, but Im not really sure how to do that in a way that doesnt discourage the breathing person on the other keyboard.  I know that Ive changed my mind on how to handle this every couple months or so.  To be honest, it was gratifying in an simple and emotional way to see Williams messages... and then humbling to see the respectful, polite, and openly questioning response.  Heres the flip side: I know Ive been talking to Brent about using the name of Wiki Spot for some official things; there absolutely are some kind of community relations that just make sense to do as I am speaking on behalf of....  Its sort of how a person can give a speech as a private person, or that same person can give a speech as the office they hold (mayor, ceo, president of a nonprofit, solider, etc) with entirely different context because they are invoking their position.  There is a valid distinction between speaking as yourself and on behalf of an organization  especially when relating to a larger community.  You are establishing that you are speaking officially for the group in which you hold a position.  The problem is that most of these role accounts never engage, so I think people dont feel they are actually engaging in the wiki community, but rather just updating their business listings, going mechanically through Craigslist, ApartmentHunter, DavisWiki, FindAHome, Facebook, done.  Now, that does leave a bad taste in my mouth (even though, as Philip points out, they are contributing through that act).  I feel like adding a concluding sentence with my position, but I dont have a position.  Maybe the best thing would be to encourage personal accounts rather than discourage role accounts.  Incidentally, the actual real two problems that many of these accounts have is that they believe the entry is their personally controlled business listing, and they treat it as such, wiping out comments and links.  If they reply, they carry a faceless, impersonal strength that I worry intimidates people (in a similar way that invoking sorry, its company policy turns an individuals decision into a implacable, impersonal truth).  Its a royal pain in the butt to clean up after them, and I dont like people feeling intimidated from having a say.  That doesnt mean they all role accounts do that, but they certainly have a higher percentage.  That behavior certainly needs to be discouraged, regardless of who does it.  To address Philips point regarding goals, Im twisting uncertainly on the point if eliminating role accounts would help improve some of the dynamics of the wiki.  There have been business owners who posted as themselves that behaved that same way (although, perhaps tellingly, the two big examples of in the last few weeks have posted under role accounts).  This is a lousy lump of thought, but its all I have, and maybe it advances some thoughts for somebody who can put it all together.  Or maybe this is simply an unclear area where best effort has to be made in every individual case. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20100128 14:15:26 nbsp For my part, I think ChautauquaManagement makes a very good point about why a larger business would want to be represented on the wiki in such a way.  For small businesses, especially sole proprietorships, I dont think it makes much sense.  Make clear your affiliation with the organization, and post as yourself.  But that doesnt cover every situation.  Ive spent some time as an administrator of an online community in which I was also a very active participant, and there were several occasions where I wished I could easily distinguish to others whether I was speaking as an individual or as an administrator.  They really were two separate personas.  I also was an administrator of sorts for an online game (a GM for Shards of Dalaya, on the off chance anyone has heard of it), and the ability to toggle my identity from the character I played to my GM role was invaluable in mediating disputes and dealing with issues that came up.

In short, I think that theres a lot of value in being able to distinguish when youre speaking as YourName, and when youre speaking as a representative of a larger entity.  My personal feeling is that the people behind the organizational accounts should be encouraged simply to create an account of their own, as well, and get involved with the wiki that way as well, rather than being discouraged from using the organizational account.

20100224 11:07:27 nbsp When you signed up, you were explicitly told NOT to use a business name. You did anyway. We were serious. It was not just a suggestion. Please read the Importance of using your RealName. Close this account immediately and edit under your real name.
There is plenty of discussion of this issue, but clearly  no consensus, no policy, and obviously no basis for the post by William Lewis. it continues his pattern of officious, offensive comments to business owners, and implies an elevated status as senior editor or administrator that he does not have. I would urge that his post on the LakewoodApartments page be removed, and that he allow others to engage business owners at how to best become members of the Wiki community. His posts are entirely counterproductive. Users/DonShor
   Actually, in this one case, he is referring to the actual wording of the signup form.  See the screenshot on Identity (or log out and click signup to see for yourself).  It is much more officious and absolute than I would have worded it, but the kernel of what he is saying is based on what is actually on the signup page.  That doesnt invalidate your concerns (Im only trying to point out the obvious counterpoint), as the tone is quite harsh. jw
  Close this account immediately and edit under your real name. Sure, when this standard is applied to all pseudonymous (is that a word?) accounts, I will see that perhaps using the imperative tone was appropriate. But (1) it is a pattern of behavior by Lewis; (2) it implies an authority that he does not have. The Identity link wont open at the moment, so Ill look at it later. But reading the different pages that are linked on this topic give no policy, nor even a clear consensus yet. I understand the argument on both sides. Im also not thrilled with pseudonyms, and actively dislike anonymous posters  and consider them much more harmful to the Wiki than organizational accounts.

20100224 11:44:33 nbsp Ok, the link opened. Please do not use nickname or business name is permissive and does not lead logically to you were explicitly told NOT to use a business name. It is nicer to ask, but it leaves open the possibility that someone will decline to accede to your request!  When you order someone to do something, it implies that you have the authority to do so, and it is often counterproductive. Perhaps they could be urged to sign up as LakeshoreApartments/Leslie, or something similar which gives an identity to the organizational account. Organizational accounts can be subject to abuse, and if the business owner or manager understands this he/she is more likely to cooperate. If it sounds like some kind of policy, a newcomer to Wiki will want to know where the policies page is and who is in charge of them. Discussing things with a nebulous coterie of editors is like fencing in the fog.  Users/DonShor
  Again, Im not defending William when I point out the phrase.  What he wrote is well over the line of what I would do myself.  But your issue is with William and his edits, and Im not quite sure why youre discussing it here rather than discussing it with him.  Hes the only one you seem to have an issue with, not a general problem with the wiki community as a whole.   Actually, so far, Im the only one who has been discussing it with him, so Im not sure what your goal in this particular thread is.  jw
   I believe that if organizational accounts are going to be discouraged, that an alternative should be suggested (as I noted above and have just bolded). One of my issues is with the way business members of the Wiki are treated in general, but I think this particular aspect of it probably belongs on this page. To your other point, I have not found it productive to discuss things with William Lewis. That could change, I suppose.  Don
     Hey, I supported actually doing business (as in actually engaging in commerce) on the wiki itself, like a public square or a more open Farmers Market (as the wiki doesnt have limited space or public health and fire safety considerations which limit the number of vendors at the Farmers Market).  Of course, as a nonprofit, we cant do that anymore, but I advocated full participation by business on the wiki (as they are part of the community itself).  Ive only recently come to the conclusion that role account names are a negative thing, and thats for different reasons than almost anybody else (see  Users/LawReviewEditor and Users/LawReview for the night I changed my mind on the issue, and some of the thoughts that led me there... which have more to do with individual accountability and strengthening the rights and responsibilities of the individual people editing than any kind of commercial or community issue.  The other, unspoken issue is that of the social equality difference between a person in a uniform or behind a desk and one who isnt).  I would still love to see the (now impossible) growth of actual commercial activity on the wiki, but if I could have that dream, I would much rather see the individual employees and business managers and owners interact as individuals rather than shifting their actions to a nonspecific entity, the same as they interact individually in a physical business.   jw
     You have never engaged me in discussion over editorial issues. I am happy to discuss things. I have a feeling youre thinking of that time when you reverted what I and two other editors had restored while discussion over the removal of the content in question was ongoing. Users/WilliamLewis
       Woops, edit conflict! Replying to both now: Feb. 2 is just one example, William: you were reverting and accused me of petty vandalism without using the talk page. Oh, and you used that imperative tone then, too. But this page is about organizational accounts. I think if I wanted to have an account as RedwoodBarn/Don, that would be a reasonable way of identifying myself as an individual who is associated with the business. If a new apartment manager comes along at Lakeshore, then a new account is appropriate for that individual associated with that business. I really think this can be explained to the business as an advantage. Don
        And then their history on the wiki is severed each time they change jobs or the place changes names?  They are limited to making edits that have to do with the business (since they are using the name)?  Its really not a great idea, IMO. jw
  You see the wording as permissive; I see it as merely being polite. Users/WilliamLewis

AllegreApartments
20101018 20:40:38 nbsp Is everybody okay with Users/AllegreApartments being used by multiple people?  Theyve already deleted some comments and somewhat swept the edit behind the plurality of people using the account.  It wasnt heinous, but the lack of accountability in the multiperson account kind of worries me, especially when theres some questionable editing occurring (and I mean that literally  there are edits occurring that I am questioning the reason behind).  Personally I dont like the role accounts (in part because they imply greater authoritybyuniform, and also this lack of accountability where the company says it rather than a person), but this is more a matter of the multiple individuals behind one account.  Its a pretty good specific example of the multiplepeople case.  Thoughts? Users/JabberWokky
    No I am not ok with it. This war needs to be handled privately. It is one thing to post a comment and let that be that but when they request and give you multiple ways to contact them and you dont do so (and say its because of reasons in their comments here) then I dont think the battle should be allowed to continue. The Wiki is not meant to be a warzone. Users/PeterBoulay.
      That doesnt have much to do with the topic of organizational accounts, nor the specific case of multiplepeople. jw
      Sorry...confusing different issues/different pages. PeteB

 For the record, I (Richard Atherton) have identified myself behind every edit and response under the AllegreApartments username.  I have been the sole editor behind this account since about late May to early June.  I have advised my manager (Jaymes Latch) that he needs to sign his comments if he ever leaves one.  He has not left a single comment or response since I was brought into the office.  Richard (Allegre)
      RichardI recommend creating an account called Users/RichardAtherton and only post using that account.PeteB
        And JaymesLatch for Jaymes.  It would help clarify things quite a bit, in my opinion.  Of course, the reason I brought it up here was to seek the opinions of others. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

     As for organizational accounts maybe a format like Allegre/Richardatherton should be used. Full names required or theyre not allowed? Just make it a rule...it makes sense. Users/PeterBoulay
    I have an account under RickJames, but that is reserved for personal use.  That account is meant for me to leave reviews and comments as I please.  AllegreApartments is meant for business use only, which is what I am doing right now.  This account was made for the sole purpose of management staff responding to comments left by Wikigoers.  The username adds a sense of officiality (Im adding that one to the dictionary) to the responses.  Signing at the bottom just reinforces that.  With a properly maintained userpage (all full names are included there), an Organizational Account is completely harmless as all the possible users are accounted for on the page.  Richard (Allegre)
        The aura of officiality is one of the problems.  How is what you add more official than Renengs comments or the comments of any other member of the community? jw
    BTW, I really like the idea of that username format.  Im not sure how much of a difference it is with what I currently do, but if the DavisWiki gods will accept that idea over my current signatures, I am definitely down for it and the manager (Jaymes) welcomes it as well.  Richard (Allegre)
        Its pretty much up to you... go ahead and disable the other account and create new ones if youd like.  Or keep the current one if you want.  Just dont create more than one (sockpuppets are generally frowned upon).  :)  There are no DavisWiki gods, just a bunch of individual people trying to work together in a community effort.  jw
       Well try to behave... Thank you for the help!  Richard (Allegre)
            Heh.  Its not about behaving... we all just have to figure out a way to get along that is aimed toward a positive end result.  The wiki is edited by normal people.  When a person is spraypainting male genitals on a park bench, most people will yell at them to quit it.  On the wiki, removing comments is vandalism.  So, when you did it  and especially when the person whose comments you removed complained  there was a outcry against that act.  The wiki is like a huge garden we all add to, and help nurture.  A few people try to abuse it, either through ignorance or (rarely) maliciousness, but the bulk of people try to help make it better.  Sometimes the zeal can get a bit antagonistic, but its generally aimed at making things better. jw
           My suggestion would be making a user account to the effect of RichardAtAllegre (or Allegre/RichardAtherton if the wiki accepts that format of username).  You can note on the user page your association with the company, and your alternate username.  I think its good to be clear when someone editing is doing so from the perspective of business representative, but its also important to have a degree of identity and accountability which isnt necessarily present with an organizational account.  I havent been following recent changes that closely lately, so I havent seen the questionable or problematic edits.  My impression has been that youre very cooperative and constructive, Richard.  But since there have apparently been issues, I think the easiest solution would be a basic name change identifying you and any other representatives individually. Users/TomGarberson
                I meant that utterly literally, and not in the shady sense of the word... there were edits that were, and should have been questioned.   Id have questioned you, Tom, had you removed a bunch of comments.   Not questioned as in they are bad, but questioned as in asking the editor Hunh?  Whadja do that for?!?.  The problem in this case is that theres not a specific person to ask about the edits, but rather a number of people using one account.  To be clear: I brought it up as a specific example of the multiplepeople case.  The whole accusations of war or whatever were tossed into the mix, and has nothing to do with my initial comment.  The thread kind of got broadsided by other issues.  It happens.  jw
                 Yeah, that was sort of my impression reviewing the series of edits on this page today.  My suggestion is directed at the general topic of this page (organizational accounts and problems) as applied to this specific case (Richard and/or Jaymes, representing Allegre).  It doesnt really have anything to do with any war that was going on, and I dont know if itd help that problem.  But in terms of general wiki citizenship, I think itd be a good way for business representatives to identify themselves. tg

20110422 20:22:02 nbsp Im curious, what do people think of user names along the lines of BobAtChautauqua?  Would that be a decent compromise, including the establishment of some amount of personal identity, while still establishing the association?  Personally, I wouldnt be opposed to simply saying no organizational accounts, informing those organizational accounts that they need to edit under a different name, suggest an example, and if they ignore it, just ban the account with an invitation to create a new, appropriate one.

Its worth noting that I dont think this would resolve all the problems.  Management at the Willows would very likely still delete other peoples photos and whatnot.  Business owners who do too much promotional crap would probably still do so.  But it gets rid of the notion of an excessively authoritative voice.  Instead of MANAGEMENT, youre dealing with SoandSo at Wherever. Users/TomGarberson
