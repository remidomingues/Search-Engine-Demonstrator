Mels Diner is a chain of 50s style diners, made famous by the George Lucas film http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069704/ American Graffiti, and being decorated with collectables and other memorabilia from the film, and having an art deco stainless steel and neon 50s feel.  The environment is relaxed  somewhat Study Spots study friendly  as you can order coffee and sit there for hours. Plenty of parking, right by interstate 80 the freeway, and not in a Shadyness Factor scary location. Its also right by InNOut. Its a pretty popular spot for Vacaville the locals to meetup, or just hang out.

Other locations include the western edge of Sacramento near CSUS on Howe Ave. (a smaller, non24hour location), in Roseville off I80 (24hour), and a few locations between Davis and the Bay Area.

Note: The actual name of this place is Original Mels. Do not confuse this with the other diners named Mels located around the country, especially the nearby and somewhat similarly themed http://melsdrivein.com Mels Drivein which has the same bloodline as that featured in http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069704/ American Graffiti. http://melsdrivein.com/aboutus/history.html Here is some historical info. Also do not confuse this with http://melsdiners.com Mels Diner, a Florida chain founded in 1989 or the Mels Diner in central Pennsylvania near Harrisburg.

20100210 14:07:27 nbsp I think this place is kind of gross, honestly. I guess its ok if youre drunk at 3am and want huge milkshakes, but nothing Ive ordered here while sober has tasted very good. Users/bear

20100219 13:39:49 nbsp For an establishment that, as fa as I can see uses no advertising in the mass media market, relying almost entirely on word of mouth since the 1950s. this is one of the better retro diners I have been to. Some staff are better than others, certain times of the day the food quality is better than at others... but overall it is a fine establishment that is a nice escape from the day to day grind of the modern world for quality food and good times even if it takes a little drive to get there. Worth checking out if you have never been. Users/WesOne
