Original Petes Pizza  Pasta  Grill was a restaurant which tried to be a Jack of all trades, master of none. Their flyer reads Our full service restaurant features: ... pizza...pasta...sandwiches...salads...beer & wine Dinein  Takeout  Delivery. Their food was not underpriced: $3.49 for Cheesy Garlic Bread, $8.49 for spaghetti. They even had a Tuesday & Wednesday Pizza pizza Buffets buffet.

It was replaced by a Panda Express.

The place is Departed Businesses shut down never to be reopened. I was an employee and eventually General Manager of the place from 20012003. Due to an change in ownership in 2003, the store went down hill and eventually closed in early 2004. There still are several locations in Sacramento. Users/JamesSchwab


20050412 00:01:49 nbsp Soon after moving from Upstate NY, I ordered the hot wings at Petes. I was shocked to get thickly batter fried wings with no sauce. The waiter claimed thats how they always serve them, and I accepted his word at first, figuring that this was the California perversion of Buffalo wings. I ate one or two, called the waiter over, and told him he was full of shit there was nothing remotely hot about them, not even pepper! I then spoke to the manager, who was nice, and gave us two compimentary orders of something that vaguely resembled Buffalo Wings. Users/CraigBrozinsky
