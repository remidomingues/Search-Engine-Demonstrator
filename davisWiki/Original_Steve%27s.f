Original Steves, the new name for Steves Pizza with a change of management from Steve to his son, makes a great Pizza pizza in mini (8), small (10), medium (12), large (14), and xl large (16) sizes. They also have pasta, hamburgers, sandwiches, soup, and a salad bar (single trip). They have good lunch specials and seating that can accommodate large groups. There is also a small video game area.

Steve Wilkinson opened his first Steves Place Pizza on 19780222 in Davis.  The Davis location is now owned and operated by his son Jeff. Steves Place, Inc. has grown to eight regional restaurants, including one in Woodland. For its 2006 sales volume, Steves was listed by http://www.pizzatoday.com/ Pizza Today as the 16th most successful independent Pizzeria in the country.

Circa 2005 Steves started only allowing sporting events on their TVs. If there is a different game on the staff will change the channel for you. Users/StevenDaubert is saddened by this due to the fact that he would watch the wwe WWF at Steves when he was young and his parents wouldnt let him watch too much TV. The TV channel limiters have been removed, and since its under new ownership anything is possible

Their breadsticks are legendary. People stumble in and order Steves breadsticks while sipping on their Woodstocks soda cups.  Users/AdamAnderson

...and they have the best croutons in town!  Users/BevSykes

If youre looking to save some bucks and still get a lot of food, try getting just the cheesy bread (with sauce).   Users/PhilipNeustrom

If you purchase a side salad, you have only one opportunity to fill the bowl at the salad bar. To exceed the capacity of the small bowl they provide, fill the bowl, layer cucumbers on the top to form a hermetic seal, layer more food on top, and repeat. At your discretion, potato salad can be used as mortar. Users/CraigBrozinsky

  Original Steves/Archive Memories from before the current owner

20110918 19:45:27 nbsp Original Steves is THE 1st Steves place pizza. It has been a longtime staple of the Davis community! When I was young the delivery vans had huge green phones on top. The breadsticks with extra cheese are always amazing, its what Ive gotten since I was real young. The pizza is good as well, its not high end like VB/Symposium but it competes nicely with Woodstocks and Lampost, and is assuredly above the cheap pizza.  Users/StevenDaubert

20110918 22:34:24 nbsp While I love Steves Place, (or Original Steves), I am saddened that WWF is not considered a sport at Steves Place/Original Steves.  I shall still eat at Steves Place/Original Steves though. Users/jefftolentino

20111118 09:50:14 nbsp Great ingredients, great (wheat) crust, great pizza.  You can tell walking in the door that the Wilkinson family really puts themselves into this place... the quality, service, and local charm have endured since their doors opened in 1978 (plus, they still have video games in the front!) Its reassuring to know that this local treasure is staying in the family, and staying in Davis for the next generation to enjoy. Users/OldDavis73

20111208 18:02:51 nbsp Steves pizza is amazing, it is the pizza I order when I am by myself Users/KellenRuel

20120122 10:59:55 nbsp I am a fan of this place. What I hate and I mean really cant stand is their on line menu! Does anyone else have trouble navigating it? Users/Sherri
 I could feel how it is irksome, just fullscreen it, zoom it in, wait a few seconds for the resolution to increase, and then move the mouse up and down to navigate it

20120323 20:23:04 nbsp I work downtown and I often used to get a small salad togo on my lunch break. They have a decent salad bar, delicious croutons, and the portion was great especially for the price. It was quite economical, AND healthy (if you dont get the bacon and the ranch dressing!). However, their prices recently went up, and their togo box sizes went down. So now Id have to pay just under $4 for something less than half the size of what I used to get  the new small togo box is just over a cup of salad, Id guess. Not happening. I can get a larger and better salad from Trader Joes for less than that, and Im not even a Trader Joes fan, but Ill do it. As for Steves actual pizza, Ive never been excited about it (its all about Village Bakery, or homemade, for me), so thats not gonna draw me back either. Sorry, Steve. Oh, and adding to this disappointing experience today, the area where they keep the croutons and sunflower seeds smelled really bad!! It had the distinct odor of damp, unwashed rag, and yet the sneezescreen was all dusty so I dont know where this dirty rag was used. No thanks... Users/gurglemeow

20130320 18:40:04 nbsp I just ordered delivery here and was extremely disappointed.  Ive had dinein and take out before and love their pizza and was very excited to find out they delivered.  The pizza i received however, was not at all what I was expecting.  It looked as though it had been sitting around for several hours.  The sauce was congealing on the edges of the pizza and the cheese was basically solid.  The pizza was still warm but tasted like reheated pizza.  Ive received delivery (form other places) that looked like it had been sitting around for a while before, but never this bad.  :( Users/AshleyE

20130620 08:18:28 nbsp Please, please, please, someone teach these employees how to wash their hands. Seriously, sooo gross. My friends like coming here for their decent happy hour deals and you wont believe how many times I see employees wash their hands...NEVER! I have seen them touch dirty tables, money, used cups, their hair and faces and more and then proceed to preparing peoples food...not okay.  Users/KelleyStevens
