Osaka Sushi was a Japanese Food Japanese restaurant and sushi bar located in the Davis Food CoOp shopping center. As of December 15, 2009, the doors are locked, no one is answering the phone, and it appears the business has been abandoned. The Davis Osaka Sushi was the first one of five in this regional chain (coowned by Koichi Mizushima from about 19982004). Alan owns Osaka Sushi, and was also a coowner of Dukes.  It looks a little sketchy from the outside, but it has one of the prettier interiors in town. The brilliant red makes the food extra yummy. Their website is pretty nice too. Recently, they began a delivery service with a $30 minimum order amount, and a $3 delivery charge offered 59 PM.

Image(kingroll.jpg, left, thumbnail, 300, The King Roll, an item on Osakas Secret Menus at Davis Restaurants Secret Menu. Thats soft shell crab on top of a whole lot of goodness.)They have a sushi bar with boats, which can be quite entertaining.

Special Nights:
  Mondays are $1 beers, $1 off on rolls, and $1 for the blue plates that go around on the boat. One dollar plates consist of either: salmon on rice, 3 cucumber rolls, 2 pieces of inari, or 2 pieces of tamago, among other things. Its generally not busy so you can request something and get it right away.
  Wenesdays a chef who speaks Japanese works from 59:30. At least two of the other chefs speak Mandarin and/or Cantonese.

Lunch is approximately $8 and dinner $13.

Current Reviews
20060207 14:35:21 nbsp One of my favorite sushi places in town! The service is always fast and friendly, the restaurant and tables are clean, and the sushi is very good. I recommend the Osaka Maki roll, which is excellent. The rice and the tempura shrimp is always warm, which makes for very fresh and delicious sushi. The only drawback is that the prices are kind of high, but you pay for good sushi, right? Users/LauraChan

20060207 17:19:19 nbsp anyone know when the fish delivery for this place comes in? Ive always thought it was the freshest in town...havent been to zen toro yet. Users/ApolloStumpy

20060214 15:12:17 nbsp Been here a handful of times. Average at best. Ive been served some pretty mediocre fish here. Bleh.  Users/RyanLeverenz

20060220 02:34:19 nbsp The quality of their sushi ranges from mediocre to not bad, depending on the day.  Many of the rolls are similar in price and quality to Fujis.  Dont come here for the rolls, the nigiri, or the maki.  Come here for the bento boxes with chicken teriyaki and tempura (about $13 during dinner, and much cheaper for lunch hours). Users/CurtisLim

20060319 18:06:39 nbsp The sushi bar is pretty expensive for dinner but its some of the best sushi in town. Users/KevinRollins

20060410 22:54:13 nbsp We had dinner here tonight.  Apparently theyve cut back on the amount of sushi you get for your money  e.g. one piece of fake crab+rice instead of two.  The quality was OK, but I think Ill start checking out the other sushi places in town. Users/GrahamFreeman

20060508 22:08:19 nbsp The sushi and sashimi platter ($15+) lacked variety I expected the sushi to be different from the sashimi!  Cmon, how about a little variety?  The sashimi was fresh and the whole thing was very filling.  Service and ambience were pretty good.  I think its funny that they served my friend water in a Coke glass and the Pepsi in a water glass. Users/JennaChan

20060526 21:11:12 nbsp The sushi I had at lunch here wasnt bad, but expensive for the quality. The sesame chicken lunch, though, was excellent. Users/JuliaCallaghan

20060527 22:21:54 nbsp I love Osaka, prefer it to even some of the Sac sushi joints (like Nishiki).  Especially the soft shell crabrollthingy.  I could eat those until I start to walk sideways. Users/LeightonHinkley

20060716 09:27:46 nbsp Over all the sushi here is not bad, just more expensive to the other resturaunts in town that offer similar quality sushi for way less $$.  i thought osakas eal rice bowl was below average.  i think Nobu Hiro has the best bento dinner boxes $9.95 (your choice of 2: salmon sashimi, tuna sashimi, chicken teriyaki, beef teriyaki, salmon teriyaki, grilled mackrel, grilled squid, gyoza, tuna roll, cucumber roll, california roll, mixed tempora,  all of which are served with sunomono, rice, miso soup, salad)  Users/MattHh

20060803 20:48:50 nbsp I love going here! This place has some bomb sushi. :) The Osaka Maki roll is really good. Their fatty tuna roll is really damn good  unfortunately, the last several times I went there, they didnt have it. I like their eel rolls, though Ive had equal or better quality in most places. I would totally recommend it. Users/ArielaHaro

20061027 nbsp The spicy tuna is amazing here. Users/TomHinds

20061108 12:46:15 nbsp Best japanese restaurant in Davis, I believe. I say this because their sushi rolls (the Big Ben) and their dinners (Nabeyaki Udon) are both very good. At most restaurants, its one or the other and someones bound to be unhappy in your group. The rolls are pricey at $1314 but theyre massive compared to most other restaurants (i.e. Moshi Moshi) but just as good or even better than Zen Toro depending upon your mood. Users/LiRic

20061202 19:39:06 nbsp Great food!  Taylor rolls ARE really good!  Thank you for the comment Sienna!  I took your advice and tried it. Users/JanetLee

20070107 13:02:13 nbsp I love their Big Ben roll.  This place is DELICIOUS.  My favorite Japanese place in town.  The customer service is great!  Good customer service goes a long way and it just adds a great vibe to the environment. Users/BeeBooBee

20070107 21:05:05 nbsp I had their Saba Shioyaki tonight and it was very dry and burnt. I wouldve tolerated it if it were cheap but it wasnt. For $15, I expect a nice piece of juicy Saba. Thats not too much to ask. In San Joses Kaita in Japantown has the same meal cooked to perfection at a much lower price($8). If you cant be better, you should at least be cheaper. On the upside, the service was fast and the spicy tuna roll was nice. Users/SoyoungLee

20070118 01:41:42 nbsp They slather sauces over every single roll which makes me afraid to try their sashimi...You can get cheaper sushi at fantastic places in San Francisco. Prices arent warranted Users/MissBelomy

20070331 09:20:42 nbsp We went to another restaurant of the same name in Woodland on Main Street. We will try the Davis location because in Woodland, the food was really pretty tasty, but since we had our 6 year old with us (who was wellbehaved  loves tamago), we were seated in the crappiest section upstairs near the service with all the dishes clanking. Also, the waitress was extremely surly and clearly did not want to serve us. I had to complain about her attitude to the owner/manager, who listened politely but did not validate our concerns by talking to the employee. In this business, its all about the service. I dont think we will go back, not sure yet.  Users/DianneAppel
  Three of us went to the Woodland restaurant on April 7, and had a completely different experience.  It was a Saturday night, but there was a very mellow, comfortable atmosphere in the place.  I didnt have high hopes because the hostess seemed to ignore us, until I got right up in front of her and she greeted me with a flat, Three?  We were seated at a table on the first floor (there is a second floor).  Our server (a young, blonde woman with glasses) mustve been a different one than Diannes, because she was upbeat, had a good sense of humor, was attentive and seemed to know the menu pretty well. We ordered a sashimi boat (an assorted selection of 30pcs of sashimi) and had a few large Orion beers.  The sashimi tasted fresh, the beer was good, and service was quick and friendly.


20070429 01:31:51 nbsp I love Osaka Sushi! My boyfriend and I have rationed our sushi consumption to once a month, otherwise our budget would be shot! We have sushi money, and for the past several months we have been going exclusively to Osaka. For a sushi joint in Davis, they are really good. Their Osaka Maki roll is the bomb, as well as their fresh salmon. Their unagi (eel) is okay,  as Ive had much better in my life. My boyfriend really likes their spicy tuna roll  but always has to suffer the consequences of eating sushi with too much Sri Racha sauce on it! All in all, Osaka Sushi has good sushi. I think their sushi is of better quality than Fujis (I know a lot of people who wait in line for a hours to eat at their buffet are going to disagree with me on this! :)) Users/ArielaHaro

20070502 12:55:21 nbsp I LOVE OSAKA SUSHI. their Y2K roll kept me coming back for more and their entrees are very good also. This place can be quite pricey but worth it if youre willing to spend.  Users/trambajuice

20070713 11:43:35 nbsp if you are vegetarian, order the Yummy Yammy Roll  its Secret Menus at Davis Restaurants not on the menu. Its a roll with yam tempura in the middle... DELICIOUS! Users/maxlovesfood

20070716 12:36:12 nbsp pretty good for vegetarians, and the udon is very tasty. Sort of expensive, but it is a good sushi joint. The waiters were efficient and fast. like ninjas.  Users/JillBenciWoodward

20070719 01:02:15 nbsp I ate here last week for lunch. I was very DISAPPOINTED with the quality of the seafood. The fish tasted stale (particularly tuna and hamachi). I took a friend and he disliked it as well. We wont be going back every again. Users/Surfnoc

20070722 18:21:08 nbsp Good sushi but expensive. It really just depends on what you value more, quality or price.  Users/AlexandraDeGrange

20070821 09:34:30 nbsp Good quality sushi, reasonably (at least by Sushi standards) priced. Osaka Maki and Y2K roll are hella good. Users/ArlenKwong

20070923 10:28:02 nbsp 6 out of 10.

I dined here last night because I was desperately in the mood for sushi. I have only been in Davis for 2 weeks and this is the first sushi place I have tried. I took one of the California Roll appetizer from the sushi boat and had a Rocky Roll. The rolls had too much rice, WAY too much. The Rocky Roll and other special rolls that I saw were HUGE and impressive sizewise, which I suppose gets the best bang for your buck, but it consists of around 70% rice!

Is there a big difference between east and west coast sushi? I think I saw the King Roll which was a monstrous mound of food (mostly rice). Im accustomed to sushi rolls that you can fit into your mouth in one bite; this came nowhere close to that. I had to eat the tuna/rice from a roll in one bite and avocado/rice from the same roll in another, usually with a full bite of rice leftover. I was very fully after that meal, but not the good sushi full that Im used to which is a good combo of fish/veggies/rice in the stomach that leaves you feeling very light and comfortable. Otherwise, the quality of the ingredients was very good, but the rice was very unappealing in such large quantities; it ruined the quality ingredients in the center.

My girlfriend ordered the teriyaki chicken box which I think is slimy no matter what Japanese restaurant you eat at. But here, there was also some kind of fatty layer surrounding the chicken, which may or may not have been the skin of the chicken breast.

I hope better sushi exists here... Users/NickStrand

20071108 10:27:20 nbsp There didnt seem much room for rice in the King Roll when I got it. Users/KarlMogel

20071108 10:52:08 nbsp Its my understanding that Monday nights are $1 per item. is this true? Users/JessicaRockwell
      Partially.  Monday night is a dollar of beer, and a dollar off of rolls.  All of the items on the small, blue plates on the bar are $1.

20080330 19:17:59 nbsp the food is ok...but compared to any of the other japanese restaurants in Davis (zen toro, sushi unlimited, fuji, moshimoshi, etc) THEY HAVE THE BEST SERVICE! the servers are very friendly, quick, and even when its extremely busy, my server at least came up to us to introduce homeself and to notify us that we will be taken care shortly.  when i went to one of the other restaurants in town, i had to wait 25 minutes at my table and none of the servers even came to offer us water.  we got up and walked out, guess where we went instead? Osaka Sushi D and btw, although they were also busy that night (i believe it was a 15 min wait to be seated) the host at least brought us some beverages as we waited in front for our table near the fish tank.

eat here, its a good overall experience.

 Users/sushieater

20080402 15:31:43 nbsp They FINALLY got rid of those punk ass asian kids that work there.  They used to be all from the same frat and just hired each other.  Ive never been greeted by a kid in a backwards hat with an over sized striped polo shirt till I ate here.  Seriously, its about time they got their act together with their servers. Users/JoeBudden

20080415 22:45:02 nbsp This is possibly one of the worst sushi restaurants Ive ever been to in my life.  We ordered a roll that was specifically advertised as king crab, no mention of crab/whitefish kani salad.  Yet lo and behold we were served a roll with 2% real crab for $12.  A california roll, which is the same thing, is much cheaper.  The off the menu uni (sea urchin) was the grossest thing I have ever seen.  We refused to eat the uni as well as the roll and asked for them to be taken off our check.  Although we will agree that the service was impeccable, even to the point of agreeing to remove the disgusting food items from our bill without even a modicum of argumentation, both my partner and I would advise all potential diners that you may well find this service is serving you  food poisoning.  I would highly recommend Zen Toro.  They are so busy, as a result of the quality of the food, the service might take a few minutes.  Skip Osaka, go to Zen Toro.   Users/unipeg39

20080418 11:00:54 nbsp Osakas is by far the best sushi restaurant in Davis.  Its pricing is fair for its quality of food and service.  I will always eat and recommend others to Osakas.  Users/Fuellenbach

20080419 01:44:17 nbsp This place is expensive.  I love sushi and am used to throwing down cash for good sushi, but this place isnt really worth it.  Sushi isnt bad; just not great.  Its one of those places where you have to either pay $100 for subpar sushi or walk out hungry.  The picture above looks good, but Ive never had that or anything that looked like that.  I should probably go and try it, but after having been there a bunch of times, Im just not motivated to go back.  Ill stick to Fujis buffet or head out to Sac and score some good sushi at Mikunis, Samarai, or Taros.  Downtown Sac also has some good sushi spots.   Users/CurlyGirl26

20080517 21:05:06 nbsp just ordered some food from here....way too much much, wasnt even cold. should raw fish be kept cold? annnnd there wasnt much fish in my rolls. dont know which is worse warm fish, or no fish at all Users/Ngooyenc

20080606 23:30:23 nbsp I work at Osakas!  I have been working there for a little over 2 years now.  Great job, great place to eat!  I can understand why some people think its pricey, for me.....I dont feel that way at all.  I watch the chefs prepare the fish, rolls, etc.  They put care into it, they put attention to detail when it comes to making rolls.  I still eat there just about 5 nights a week, and have yet to get tired of the food.  That holds a lot of sway for me when it comes to liking or disliking a place as a favorite, or just so, so.  Its no buffet,  you will leave full for the same price you pay at the buffet though.  I have tried Fujis, the new Davis Sushi Buffet, Zen Toro, Sushi Unlimited and Moshi Moshi.  I thought Zen Toros rolls are very creative and delicious, the service was so bad that I havent been back, Sushi Unlimited is in the same boat, except the service was worse.  The buffets are good for people who want to get stuffed to there gills and leave with a big happy hard to walk grin on their face.  That is not my thing personally, I would rather have a smaller meal that was prepared with more consideration and quality in mind. Moshi, Moshi is great, I just find it hard to eat there since I would rather go to the place that is familiar and where I know exactly what I am getting on many levels.  I personally served the table of unipeg39.  It sucks that I didnt know our Alaskan Roll has SOME Kani in it.  It is actually a 50/50 split between Kani and The Alaskan Crab.  I have been happily eating the Alaskan Roll since discovering this on that fateful day and I still think it tastes good......  As far as the Uni, it wasnt on that day, it looked like it was past its prime, which happens quick with Uni, as far as food poisoning goes.  No.  I have never had it, been eating here (including the older Uni the Chefs are going to toss)  If you want Uni come on Friday night for the freshest, thats when it is delivered, and any other weekend day.  It isnt ordered enough to make it cost effective to serve all week long.  You should not have been served that Uni, I take responsibility for bringing it to your table.  Like I said, I have been eating here for a long time, since I was little actually, its a good restaurant, with the some of the best, and fastest service I have had. Users/MattHarris

20080608 22:23:55 nbsp I am a huge fan of Osaka Sushi!  The Spider Roll is scary to look at, but delicious to eat!  The Chicken Karage/ Teriyaki Chicken dinner combo is my goto meal when I cant decide what to order.  I really enjoy this restaurant.  Users/AynReyes

20080630 19:40:59 nbsp Awesome! The food and sushi were great! Users/sweetsoni

20080713 22:04:41 nbsp Went to Osaka the other day for dinner with the family.  Its been the go to place when we want Japanese food in town, and has been for the last 9 years.  While it is relatively pricey, the food has always been very good, and the portions have not diminished.  Our experiences have been generally very good except for the last time we went.  The waitress, I believe she was Vietnamese, gave very poor service.  Initially the wrong order, no refills on water (unless asked), had to be reminded to get the roll we ordered, didnt bring a requested plate for a child to use.  What irritated me the most was she seemed distracted and responded to all our requests with a yeah, sure.  It wasnt even busy, as it was a Tues night with UCD students out for the summer.  She may be a bad seed, so maybe this is more of a rant than a review.   Users/UsetheForce

20080826 10:40:27 nbsp Visited for the first time last night, a Monday. There was no evidence of $1 beers or any other Monday specials, but we werent sitting at the bar. Took the kids and found it kidfriendly. Appetizers were large enough for a kid meal (yakitori, tempura). Asked for tsukemono (not on menu) and they brought me a small plate of daikon tsukemono without charging me. Meal took FOREVER to arrive and waiter didnt check on us frequently. The other waitress in our serving area seemed much more on the ball and noticed that we were waiting for our check and got our waiter to come. I thought the big rolls ($12$14) were terrific; the nigiri sushi and maki combos less so. Highly recommend the spider roll, with nice daikon sprouts and tons of roe. Osaka Maki also good. Fabulous special sake surprise, which was salmon sashimi wrapped around deep fried jalapeno rings. I would never have ordered this in a million years, but my mother was intrigued, and it turned out to be sublime. Waiter said its even better with hamachi. All told, $100 for two adults and two kids (two appetizers, three big sushi plates, udon, tempura, a sushi combo, two beers, two sodas,extra rice, tip); this was way too much food and we ended up taking home the udon, half the yakitori, and a fair amount of the sushi. Ill be going back for sure! Users/Virginia

20081010 20:43:02 nbsp Sure the place looks like a hole in the wall from the outside, but inside has a very chic and warm ambiance.  It was busy on a Friday but we had no wait and the staff was very attentive.  Amazing service was friendly and fast.

The quality of food was very good.  I had a bento box and two ala carte sushi.  This turned out to be too much food so I left very full.  Their portions are very generous without being too overwhelming or wasteful.

The teriyaki chicken was a bit fatty and lackluster in my opinion, California rolls had barely anything in them, and the salad was a little more than garnish, but thats all the negatives I could think of as I enjoyed my meal.  Dinner was very reasonably priced: $13.00 for a bento box.

Ill definitely come here again! Users/GeorgeDrake

20081012 10:26:09 nbsp The service was really friendly. I liked the atmosphere. Their sesame chicken was really good. The sushi was not as impressive. Users/feichuhuya

20081115 20:02:08 nbsp Been here a few times since I moved into my apt on 8th. Great service, not sure about the sushi, but the Tonkatsu and the Katsudon were tremendous, while the shrimp shu mai was kinda mediocre. Regardless, I had a great experience here, cant beat a great katsudon for $9.95. Users/AlexChiang

20081215 12:30:34 nbsp I went here for their Monday night special ($1 blue plates) and Ill just say that you get what you pay for. Im sorry to say that I was underwhelmed. We also had a rather expensive cut roll and for $12 it was not that great. I only had their sushi so I cant comment on their cooked dishes. Just for reference, Ive eaten at quite a few sushi places in Southern California. Maybe this is par for the course in Davis? Users/DrWang

20081224 21:07:02 nbsp I LOVE THIS PLACE!...but it is pricey but well worth the money! I ordered the Y2K Roll ($15) but it was HUGE, I was stuffed along 3/4 way into the roll. I dont recommend the ramen noodle dish, maybe bento boxes during lunchtime is more worth it (since its slightly cheaper than dinner time)and their sashimi is fresh and sliced quite thick. The King Roll is a definite order too! Service was good, waiters were friendly and informative of the menu items. Very cozy seating and good atmosphere.  Users/MissAmyQ

20090111 14:25:52 nbsp I went here today for lunch and was terribly disappointed by the service. The food was alright (I had a tempura bento box and my boyfriend had the chicken katsu bento box) but the service was just downright atrocious. We were ready to order a minute after we sat down but were ignored for about 10 minutes until the hostess noticed and took our orders  not our server, but the hostess! I can be quite understanding when its busy and the servers have to take of several tables at a time, but cmon. There were only 6 other tables aside from us! I had to ask for 2 cups of water twice  the couple next to us had ordered water as well, which no one seemed to remember until much later. What I got from this restaurant was a lack of organization and understanding of how to see to the customers needs. The servers seemed nice enough, but when service is that lacking it really reflects back on the restaurant. Maybe it was just today because we went for lunch on a Sunday, but I dont think Ill be coming back to Osaka anytime soon. Users/AliceW

20090815 21:19:49 nbsp I lived in Davis for about 28 years. I havent eaten at Osaka Sushi in many years since I moved to the city of West Sacramento. I do remember great food, and I loved the Sushi Boats that would float by at the sushi bar. Im about to go back, and I certainly hope that they havent dispensed with the sushi boats. Atmosphere is half of the experience of dining out, and I loved that touch of kitch of the boats. I hope I wont be disappointed. Users/Darren22

20091118 14:22:16 nbsp In my opinion, this is the BEST sushi place in town!  I wish I came here before my last year at UCD rather than wasting my time and money at Sushi Unlimited, Zen Toro, Fujis, etc.  The Y2k Roll and the Big Ben roll are delicious.  The staff is very courteous and friendly.  They replaced my boyfriends dish when it was overly burnt and even took it off the bill.  The man in the front is very nice too.  Overall a great experience.  I always come here to satisfy my sushi cravings when Im in Davis. Users/ElizabethLee

20091211 00:57:17 nbsp Does anyone know whats going on w/ Osaka? My roommate went a few days ago and said she saw a sign saying theyd be closed Monday/Tuesday unexpectedly. Without knowing that, I tried to call in an order yesterday and the phone just kept ringing and ringing.  She went by again today and said theyre just closed...flat out closed w/ no sign on the door or anything. I didnt ask her what time she went so hopefully they were just closed btwn lunch and dinner, but Ive been kind of concerned for them since every month since October theyve had some kind of crazy special (buy one get one 50% off, etc). Anyone know whats up? Itll be quite the tragedy if they shut down :( Users/AliceCheng

20091216 20:34:33 nbsp As of 12/16/09, there is a letter taped to the window that says something about a notice of abandonment.  Im really bummed out about this!

20091224 08:50:19 nbsp Dropped by for dinner last night, and we were greeted by a closed sign, and a notice of abandonment from the county.  Seems as though their fish were just left there, so animal control had to come pick them up.   Sad.  I loved their sushi. Users/Zippypickle

20100318 12:53:44 nbsp Sorry to see it go. I loved their spider rolls. They probably closed because they gave you too much food for your money. Sigh...I guess its Zen Toro for me now. Good food, but so expensive. Users/Virginia

20110805 10:19:17 nbsp Used to be a Straw Hat Pizza before Osaka came in, early 90s I believe.  Used to be they had a projector (a big deal back then), and you could take in the whole kids (soccer, basketball, whatever) team... theyd show the footage any parents shot of the game on the big screen.  The sushi boats were very cool at Osaka, salmon was oishi. Users/OldDavis73
