20081229 15:32:39 Hey Oscar, that was a nice compromise edit on Tragic Events, taking into account both the familys stated wishes and the need to have enough specifics to be able to maintain a historical record.  In fact, zipping through your edit history, youve been quietly making quite a few really nice edits.  Thanks for the effort put into the wiki... as a fellow wiki editor, I just wanted to say that it is appreciated.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
