The Osher Lifelong Learning Institute (OLLI) offers a diverse educational program of high quality, affordable courses and events for senior citizens seniors living in Davis and nearby communities. This is done on a quarterly basis. Every quarter they have an instructors kickoff (free and open to everyone) in which the instructors give a short synopsis of what their class entails. People may sign up then, or later. There is an annual $20 membership fee, in addition to class fees which are around $40. Classes are grouped into health & fitness, literature & philosophy, art & music, film study, history, politics and current events, science, and specialties. Classes are taught at the Davis Art Center, Eleanor Roosevelt Circle, Unitarian Universalist Church, Varsity Theater, and Willowcreek Park. Some classes include field trips, such as to San Francisco art museums.

They also sponsor the annual Kangas Lecture, which is free and open to the public.
