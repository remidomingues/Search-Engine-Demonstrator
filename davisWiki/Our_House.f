They opened on June 15, 2011.

Users/MeggoWaffle One person initially checked out their menu and was very disappointed to find zero Vegetarian Options vegetarian entrees. However there is now a vegetarian gnocchi entree, as well as corn on the cob and grilled artichoke appetizers.

With their new Fall Menu (2012), they introduced an almost completely gluten free menu, excluding only three or four choices.

20110615 22:18:38 nbsp Went to the open house yesterday, and I cant wait to go back. We enjoyed a Sidecar, Lemon Drop, Carys Cosmo (gluten free and lots of cranberry) and Mojito, along with fabulous appetizers (the amazing Salmon Poke BETTER be on the menu!) and deserts.  Its the kind of comfort food restaurant Davis will love. Users/Davidlm

20110616 12:51:10 nbsp Wow, what a cool new place. Havent tried the food yet but it sounds amazing. Went in for drinks last night and lounged on the couches, very chill atmosphere. My only complaint is that they charged $11 for a small glass of wine. Holy hell thats a lot! This is Davis, not NYC! But the well drinks and other cocktails were very reasonably priced, so well be back (just not for the wine). Hope they have happy hour specials coming! Users/cerise

20110621 23:11:34 nbsp Ceris We have added many great wines starting at $6 a glass plus they are $2 off on happy hour stop by and check out our updated list. We are adding to the wine list daily as the wineries deliver. Users/charlieswanson

20110627 23:07:27 nbsp Ate at Our House a few nights ago and it was amazing, very relaxed, you can go for an evening out and dress up or stay casual and relax. Great service, ask for Daniel, he was great. As for the food, Ribs are a little tough, but otherwise everything is worth the price, by far the best food in Davis. Make sure you try the Five Onion Soup and Tequila Lime beef. Users/Mike95616

20110630 16:33:11 nbsp I cant wait to go! Im looking forward to having a menu posted here. Users/ashleyinthemist

20110701 14:52:03 nbsp I recently went to Our House for lunch.  It has a relaxed yet sophisticated interior with jazz music playing which made the dining experience more enjoyable.  The food I ordered, the five spice chicken salad, was good although I felt that it could of used a little more spice (however I enjoyed that it didnt taste heavy like many restaurants make their salads by adding lots of sugar, fat, and salt).  I felt the food was a little overpriced for what was given should probably drop the price by a dollar or so.  I am definitely interested in visiting again for drinks as I enjoyed the atmosphere (and AC!) and will probably give another food item on the menu a shot.   Users/bordiga

20110702 01:11:38 nbsp VERY over priced. Food was ok, but the service was TERRIBLE! Found a hair in my $10 drink as well. Very noisy. Uncomfortable chairs. BAD layout. Couldnt even get a water refill after dropping over $150 for our table. Miss the old tapas place that used to be there. Would not go again. Users/Antoinette

20110703 08:44:19 nbsp I have been wanting to see what  Our House had to offer for about a week and I went here the other night with a couple of friends. First impression was that the decor was pretty cool, with some couches and raised wood tables to sit at. The music didnt fit at all with the vibe I think they were trying to create, as they were playing some classic rock which is normally not a bad thing.
We didnt try the food but had a round of drinks. The drinks were bad, I mean bad, and it took over 5 minutes to get 3 relatively simple drinks.
Ill wait until they iron some things out before I try this place again. Users/moonmonkey18

20110705 21:31:22 nbsp The salmon and the smore desert are very, very good.  The filet and the cheesecake?  Amazing. Users/MarkSanger

20110713 10:26:51 nbsp I was disappointed in the decor. Looked kind of common to me. Found the wine to be overpriced as well as the beer. Pork sliders were good. Service was okay. Sort of disappointed. If they dont lower food and wine prices, theyre going to go out of business. Give good value and service. Thats the key. Users/dianamuprhy

20110713 11:48:51 nbsp I had lunch here yesterday with a group of 6. I had the Five onion soup and Ceaser salad with chipotle glazed chicken both were delicous! Others in my group had the grilled chicken sandwich and the Walnut curry chicken sandwich they thought it was very good. The service was excellent! Users/agerould

20110714 11:48:51 nbsp Id love to see some more vegetarian choices on the menu. Options are very limited for vegetarians. Users/SDAK

20110714 10:47:55 nbsp I went here last night, and my beer was tasty (Xingu Black). But I also I ordered the five spice chicken salad and it was terrible.  I could have gotten something better out of a plastic bag at the grocery store. So...go there, get drunk, and then eat someplace else.  Users/Sorrel

20110715 11:44:07 nbsp I have been here for lunch and loved it. My friend had a salad that she enjoyed. The chicken curry sandwich is awesome! I would not however want to go if I had a limited time for lunch. It was a very long lunch. I am going tonight with my family for dinner. I cant wait!;>) Users/ashleyinthemist

20110718 21:21:08 nbsp Husband and I stopped by tonight and were so impressed! Our House is elegant yet cozy, and the menu is creative and reasonably priced. Cant wait to go back!  Users/EmilyGardner

20110719 10:29:02 nbsp Went there for dinner with a friend.  Love the new decor.  I had the Filet Steak Au Poivre, which was flavorful, but on the tough side. My friend had the Salmon and it was perfectly cooked and had a nice balance of flavors. We had amazing service as well. I am going back for lunch tomorrow. Users/LokiAbbi

20110722 20:05:01 nbsp We had an early dinner here tonight (Friday).  Staff was very friendly and service was excellent.  Very quick, very well timed.  Appetizers came out within probably 6 or 7 minutes of ordering, and he brought out our entrees as soon as he cleared the appetizer plates.  It was impressive for such a new place.

The food was a mixed bag.  Our appetizers were excellent.  I got the tequila lime beef with lime ginger dipping sauce and it was absolutely fantastic.  You cant really tell from the menu, but its done up as little wraps in fresh tortillas with some sauteed peppers and onions.  The dipping sauce was delicious, steak was tender and wonderful.  One of the better appetizers Ive come across.  My wife had a Mediterranean caprese salad that was a slight twist on the traditional  fresh heirloom tomatoes, eggplant, and smoked mozzarella; the basil was finely chopped over the top.  The smokiness of the mozzarella was pretty mild and very pleasant, and the eggplant was deliciously salty.  All extremely well balanced.

The entrees were a little more iffy.  I got one of their specials, a hamburger that had bacon ground into the patty, with some kind of aioli and whatnot.  It really wasnt that interesting.  A bit on the dry side (hard to do with bacon in the patty) and just not that much going on.  It honestly didnt have anything on a Gradburger, and it fell short of something from Sudwerk or Burgers and Brew.  It came with some very fresh, housemade potato chips that were reasonably tasty.  Very mild, slightly salty.  A pleasant but not particularly exciting side.

My wife had the lemon ricotta gnocchi with pancetta.  The gnocchi were pretty good.  Largish, not too heavy.  The sauce was quite a bit heaviervery creamy, very strong lemon flavor.  It was interesting.  If youre not a big fan of lemon, I wouldnt recommend it, but we both liked it well enough.

Drinks were... pricey.  I got a Hop Ottin from Anderson Valley (mislabeled as Hop Ottin Boonville IPA ... thats where the brewerys located, but its not the brewerys name) and my wife had a Boont.  I believe they were $5 each (we got there during happy hour, so got a dollar off)... for bottles.  Oddly, the menu doesnt identify them as bottles, or indicate what might be on tap vs. whats not.  Id expect that price for pints if they were on tap, but thats pretty hefty for 12 oz. off the supermarket shelf.Footnote(For comparison, The Davis Beer Shoppe, which certainly isnt known for discount beer, currently has Hop Ottin on tap for $3.49 per imperial pint (20 oz. glass, roughly 18 oz. pour)  My understanding is that a 200300% markup is pretty typical, but this was in the 400500% range.  The cheapest wine I recall was $7 for a glass, and a lot of them werent all that exceptional.  They had some cocktails in the $56 range, but others, in the martinis etc. category (including a sidecar), were up around $910.  Im really not sure why.

Anyway, all in all, it was a decent experience.  I enjoyed the service and the appetizers were excellent.  I dont know if Id do a full meal again, but its a nice place to stop in for something light.  The alcohol isnt worth it. Users/TomGarberson

20110812 22:43:11 nbsp Ate here for dinner on a Friday night, and the food was great!  Ordered the Rootbeer BBQ Pork sliders, and chicken corn chowder, and they were DELISH.  The wait staff was very eager to serve us, and couldnt have been nicer.  Overall, the atmosphere was chic and I really enjoyed the experience. Users/katietakara

20110816 23:39:26 nbsp This place is amazing. The service took a little long and there were only a total of 6 people in there, including myself and a friend....but the food is worth the wait. the presentation is amazing and the atmosphere can fit any occasion: casual, romantic, fun night out with friends. The food is a TAD pricey, but it is a specialty restaurant, that is expected. overall, one of my FAVORITE restaurants in Davis.  Users/Shelle

20110827 23:20:50 nbsp Went for dinner and was very excited to try this new place out, but the food was just ok and the service was pretty bad. Drinks were fun (jalapeno margherita). We ordered 2 appetizers, a salad and one entree to share between the two of us. They brought out three dishes at once (salad + 2 appetizers) and the very apologetic waitress said the entree was about to come out too! So we ate as fast as we could to make room on our tiny table for the entree ... which didnt actually come for another 15 minutes. :(   The Ahi Poke was good, but most of the other things were just ok and the entree (BBQ salmon) was dry. I might go back when things are more under control, but maybe not. Ill go to Tucos for a guaranteed good meal + good service at the same relative price. Users/RobynW

20110906 12:51:57 nbsp Did not like the decor.  Trying to go for a classy place but the blinding light from the Televisions really took away.  It was kind of a pub mixed with find dining with the fine dinging prices.  The wine was overpriced as well as the rest of the menu considering the service we received.  We pushed through and ordered our meals.  It took almost 45 minutes then the waiter asked if we need some bread to tie us over and when we said yes he came back with the food and said the bread was too long to cut(They didnt have bread obviously).  When we when into the steaks it was terrible.  I mean if I was paying 10 dollars for the steak I would be happy but 30 dollars was terrible.  The steaks were dry and terrible unflavorable.  The waiter came out and appoligized saying they steaks should have been rubbed down in oil.  It was ovious it was but there was NO spice.  We got the pork sliders instead of our steaks which were okay but I could have made just as good on a camping trip.  It was obvious the buns were from safeway.  DO NOT GO HERE! Users/LucasSiegfried

20111023 22:44:14 nbsp As a fine dinning server, I can say that this place is great.  The service was warm and inviting, despite the fact that I am a college studentwhich sometimes leads to bad serviceand the food is delicious.  I love the filet; I will always make sure that someone in my party orders it.  This is where I go when I want to have a nice meal in Davis.  They seem to be attracting the same clientele as Bistro 33 and I would say its WAY better. Users/CourtneyMullarkey

20111111 22:04:21 nbsp I have been to our house twice now when King Hall hosted its bar review there.  I liked the atmosphere.  The drinks seem to be slightly higher priced than other bars in town.  Luckily they had drink specials both times.  On the first occasion one of the bartenders did not get the memo on the drink specials and I was overcharged by about five dollars, but when I pointed this out the next day, they were super courteous and gave me a refund for the difference in cash.  I will definitely be coming back.   Users/ChrisDietrich

20111121 09:36:22 nbsp A group of us went here for the first time a few weeks back and we were sadly disappointed upon leaving. Our House is so overpriced its almost insulting to people who know the restaurant/bar scene. First, there is no beer on tap, who opens a bar without beer on tap?, and they charge $5 for a bottle of beer (seriously...$5 for a Corona) unless you want a domestic and they charge $4 for that (If its beer your looking for go to the Davis Beer Shop). Their cocktails are overpriced for Davis, and when we did order one it was nothing to write home about.  We went here thinking it was going to be a nicer environment given the prices and the decor, which it was until we soon found out that around 9:3010:00 this place turns into just another Davis college bar packed full of college kids taking shots and lurking over you waiting for your seat. If you do go here, I would go for lunch when the menu is more reasonably priced and your not dealing with the Happy Hour crowd, unless thats what your looking for. Users/seanjones

20111128 14:17:28 nbsp I went here with a couple of friends and was expecting quality not crap. I mean seriously I dont know what kind of standards they have there. The Gm I think his name is Jon was rude to us while waiting for our food. We waited for an 1hr to get some simple food. I assumed when they talk local but they really buy sysco or non local farms.But if  they buy any produce from the farmers market you can just look at there menu and know they didnt even think about what the farmers grow at this time of the year Aspargus All year arounds. My only other complaint was the Salmon I was sick for all night long and when i called to let the restaurant know they told me that it was something else i ate but thats not possible. I want even asking for a free meal just sharing what happen; who ever took that call is just straight up rude.
If you want a great drink in davis go to our house for Food However steer clear. If you read other reviews on yelp the same thing is happening to a couple of people..

 Users/rachington11

20120202 08:28:31 nbsp Ive been here twice now, and I have to admit that Im very disappointed. I was initially rather excited about the prospects of this place based on their early statements about what they were looking to do with the restaurant, but I dont think theyve achieved any of them. My heart sank the moment I took a glance at their cocktail menu for the first time. For a place that was aiming to be one of the best cocktail locations in Davis, the list is incredibly bland.
But even if I wasnt going to be impressed with the bar, there was always a chance that the restaurant was worth it. Unfortunately, no. The service both times was unacceptable at their price point. (side note: why does the Davis/Sac area have such a hard time providing decent service unless youre at an expensive restaurant??) Service was incredibly slow between each course. We rarely saw our server, and they didnt seem very informed about the dishes. We actually had to ask another server for our check on one visit because we hadnt seen our server in so long.
On top of that, the food was just average. I had a tomato bisque that reminded me far too much of Campbells. A caesar salad hadnt had enough water shaken off the lettuce. The gnocchi were ok. The best thing I had was the sourdough bruschetta, sadly. Nothing else was memorable. And I will second another reviewers comment that it was very weird to see blatantly outofseason produce on the menu of a nicer restaurant in Davis. I think I counted 3 entrees with asparagus in December?
In all, I wont return unless I hear something has changed. Theyre selling at Seasons prices, but the food and the service arent nearly as good. Users/MattCzarnowski

20120219 20:07:43 nbsp Had dinner here on Friday. The tequila lime beef was fine, ravioli undersalted, and the steak overcooked (mediumrare came out crispy, dry, and brown in the middle). We waited a truly ridiculous amount of time for someone to take our order, bring the appetizer, then the entrees, then the bill. Dinner overall took 2 hours in a restaurant that was barely half full. I cook better, cheaper, faster, and can do it all without getting out of my jammies to go to a nice restaurant. Would not recommend! Users/KatherineChiu

20120325 11:20:14 nbsp We went here for Valentines Day and I have to say I was pretty disappointed.  My gnocchi was rubbery, and it took nearly 45 minutes to get to our table.  For the price, this restaurant was not worth it for us, and next time well go somewhere else.  I miss Aioli! Users/sjmcdonnel
  My rule of thumb: never judge a restaurant by Valentines Day.  Corollary: Dont eat out on Valentines Day.  Restaurants are never at their best on that day.  I havent been to this restaurant, so I cant say whether your experience was typical, but I would suggest that you give them another try.    Users/CovertProfessor
   With the utmost respect for all the edits that C.P. does Ive held my tongue for a long time about this establishment, #1: Its not fine dining, its super expensive dining, if you pay $30 for an entree and $5 for soup and $5 for the salad no matter what day it is, it should be spectacular, note: This is not including alcohol or tips. Fine dining to me; carpet not concrete, mellow interior not Gettysburg green, nice ceiling panels, not smelly old ceiling panels, and almost got knocked out by the swinging kitchen door on my way to the bathroom and on my way back. If you ever mention the Fats family name you should always be on your game because ive eaten at their establishments for over 4 decades. And this is just my opinionUsers/Theangrydiner
    You havent disagreed with anything I said.   Users/CovertProfessor

20120411 22:57:01 nbsp I havent been here for dinner, but our business group meets here every week in the banquet room, and the staff has been very accommodating and the food great! If you knew what we went through to find a meeting space in Davis with catering that a) didnt charge $200 for the privilege of using an ancient fluorescentlit convention space for an hour, and b) had food of a quality that we would all WANT to eat each week... Weve all been super happy with the food, particularly the pork sliders, the chicken corn chowder, and the wedge salad. I could write a term paper about how good the bleu cheese dressing is! My advice? Stick to lunch if youre unsure, and feel the place out before taking the more expensive dinner plunge. Users/LilyS

20120724 18:24:06 nbsp Cons:
 I really want to love this place but seriously, they need some vegetarian entrees. Their promise to add more once the restaurant is up and running full speed has remained unfulfilled for the past year.
 If they are out of the key ingredient for the only vegoptional entree (gnocchi), as happened last time I was there, they should come up with a backup veg dish.
 I would recommend avoiding the grilled corn with smoked chili butter  it was not on the cob as I pictured, no trace of chili, and tasted like it came from a can. This was during the winter, so maybe they have fresh corn now that its in season.
 Partner usually gets the filet, but it has been so overcooked a few times (ordered medium rare) that even the sauce couldnt really save it from being too dry. Other times it is perfect. Inconsistent chef?
 Ambiance is hit or miss. Last time we were there the stereo wasnt even on. Kind of eerie being in a restaurant without background music. And it was literally about 60 degrees inside.
 Service is hit or miss. Sometimes they are great, but one waiter kept disappearing even though the place was almost empty, took forever to get our drinks, and wasnt very friendly. Our most recent waiter, Katrina, was great.
 Would not recommend the endive salad. The flavors skew too sweet.

Pros:
 Their vegetarianoptional entree, the gnocchi, was delicious (though a bit oily for my taste) the first time I had it. Second time I had it, it was completely different and not very good at all (which again speaks to the consistency issue) they said it was because they were understaffed and gave us free dessert (had offered a replacement dish butttt again, lack of veg choices).
 The vegentree dearth aside, a vegetarian can get enough to eat by mixing and matching smaller items on the menu.
 Highly recommend the spinach salad with strawberries, onions, almonds, goat cheese, and sesame dressing (not on the menu anymore, hope it will be back).
 The bruschetta is amazing.
 The mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, and sourdough (when not dry/hard as with the most recent visit) with herb butter are all tasty but nothing you cant make at home with a good recipe.
 The grilled artichoke is interesting, but they might be better off grilling just the hearts for dipping. Users/MeggoWaffle

20120805 19:45:48 nbsp Our House has the best wine list in Davis. I usually go there Sunday nights when you can get a bottle of wine for 1/2 price. I like their BBQ Salmon and Baby Back Pork Ribs dishes. The Mac and Cheese is also good. They have an excellent staff: Servers Karen, Courtney, and Kristen; cooks Brad and Matt.   Users/nowhereman

          We no longer have the halfoff bottle of wine special, we replaced it with our happy hour.  Users/CourtneyMullarkey

20121017 10:56:21 nbsp Came here the other day with my boyfriend with a groupon for two glasses of wine, two entrees and an appetizer. I have been here before only for their happy hour drinks and appetizers around when they first opened and the food wasnt great, but I decided to give it another shot since they have been open longer. As other reviews have stated they have a good wine list, however for a $12 glass of syrah, I expected a heartier pour. Anyways, got the the crab cakes which were delicious! Definitely recommend these. For the main course my boyfriend got the cauliflower risotto with prawns and truffle oil, which he enjoyed but said it didnt measure up to the crab cakes. I got the special which was a pappardelle pasta with a wild mushroom cream sauce and poached egg, sounds great right? Wrong. Bland, everything was stuck in a big lump, the only distinct flavor was the whole mushrooms themselves. I added salt to the dish just so I could taste something. I still ate it, but reluctantly. Our waitress was really attentive and answered all of our questions, no complaints about the service. I am wondering if maybe ordering a meat dish here is the way to go as they have a few fish choices and steaks that sounded good. Dont know if I will give it another try, but if I do Ill order meat.

Bill ended up being around $90 not including tip. Would honestly rather go to Tucos around the corner for this price as I have had better experience with the food there and they have similar qualities of wine for cheaper. Seems like Our House really needs to step up the quality and consistency of their main entrees.   Users/cj2012aggie

20121113 09:27:40 nbsp Everything was good except the busy bar hard to get a drink plus the knowledge of the bartender with the wines. Well the food was much better than that other place(seasons)better tasting plus more consistant. If i could go back in time when there were sommeliers working in davis like Jeff at that other place, we need to get PROS back to davis I think that if the people want a fine dining experience that they will enjoy OUR HOUSE RESTAURANT hands down is the best restaurant in davis.I feel like they are just lacking a couple of details that only the pros of fine dining can fix,so to management get the right people in place make OUR HOUSE FLY INTO ITS #1 SPOT IN DAVIS. Hands down its really the best restaurant in that area. The second is Mustard Seed.If you have not tried them you should. Well you will hear more from me because I have lots of time on my hands, now that I am retired.  Users/MIKEDUNN

20121128 11:31:19 nbsp Well i agree with you the place is the new #1 fine dining bar experience needs some work. I heard through the grapevine that  the sommelier may be coming to work there. anyway i had a great time I wish they would hire a great bartender like the one they had at seasons years ago(JEFF) boy that place really went down fast that bth of a manager you know that asian that should be kept in the back lost all her KEY PEOPLE THINKING SHE KNEW HOW RUN THINGS.(IN TO THE GROUND).WELL BACK TO OUR HOUSE IS NEEDED TO HAVE A SPOT FOR BOTH COLLEGE KIDS AND ADULTS.I can not wait to go back food great people fair I think the restaurant will do great just get the party started hire a great bar tender that knows everyone and that everyone likes that(JEFF GUY FROM SEASONS WOULD BE THE BEST BET TO MAKE THE RESTAURANT STELLAR.BEST OF LUCK Iwill be back many times thank you for opening Users/BIGBALU

20121202 19:41:50 nbsp This posting is not so much in regards to Our House as a restaurant, but rather to some recent posts on their wiki page.  As someone who has dined at Seasons over the years, I couldn’t help but notice that “MIKEDUNN” and “BIGBALU” have the same IP address which means that both users are either sharing a computer or it’s the same person. Suspiciously, “MIKEDUNN” has the same IP address as “bythelchafin” on the Seasons page which “MIKEDUNN” also posted on. It’s interesting how all three users have posted comments with the same general recurring theme of how the management of Seasons was so incompetent to let Jeff go and how Our House would be so wise to hire him or someone like him. Further, these comments read more like rants rather than constructive consumer advice since no specifics are ever mentioned.What is most interesting is that Jeff’s full name is Jeff Bythel Chafin, which I remember as it’s pretty unique. Hmmm, maybe it’s just one overwhelming coincidence or possibly an unemployed bartender who really just wants to server up some sour grapes. Users/DavisBarFly

20130127 20:15:23 nbsp The food and atmosphere are awesome but the staff is the best part. Im here right now and all of the waitress and the bartender are friendly and beautiful women. The bartender (I think her name is Kat or Katrina) is especially nice! Users/DavisBusterPosey

20130217 15:02:55 nbsp Ill start off by saying I love the music and dance floor at Our House. However, I have been here a handful of times now and I am completely dissatisfied with their customer service. It takes forever to get drinks at the bar (much longer than you will wait at any other bar in Davis in my opinion), and their bouncers are completely rude. My friend got her jacket stolen there, and when I asked the bouncer he just shouted Its not our responsibility! And then we wanted to go back in to look for it and he wouldnt let us. I dont think Ill be going back here in the future.  Users/LouiseM

20130220 15:29:44 nbsp We were reluctant to try this place because of the mixed reviews, but went anyway because it was the only place with live music early on a Saturday evening.  Wanted to post here because unlike many other reviewers my husband and I had a very nice experience.  The staff was attentive, the jazz duo made for a really nice atmosphere, and the food was very good.  I had crabcakes and porkchop, my husband had the chicken corn chowder and steak.  Everything was very flavorful and though a bit pricey, not more than any other place serving this kind of food.  We both liked the food better than Seasons and Bistro 33. Users/xtine

20130816 11:29:38 nbsp This is very belated...went to Our House in the first 2 weeks they opened and was very disappointed.  The atmosphere was basically dark and depressing.  Asked for bread and the waiter said we dont have it yet (funny since theyre practically next door to the Village Bakery).  The dinner was not memorable and the skimpy portions made me think I was on a diet.  I really wanted a new place to add to my restaurant rotation.  First impression was enough to keep from returning.   Users/CameronMunnally
