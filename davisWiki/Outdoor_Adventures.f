 Water Program 
 Rafting 
OA is one of the largest commercial rafting outfitters in the state. They hold several commercial permits that allow for nearly 100 people to go rafting a day and have a fleet of over 15 whitewater rafts. Outdoor Adventures utilizes expeditionsized oar boats to haul gear on longer trips. OAs rafting program is mainly focused on class III rivers, though they offer a few class IV and V trips during the Spring and Summer. Rafting Guide School, aka BGT, takes place over Spring break.
  South Fork of the American River 
 Only an hour from Davis, this Class III damfed river is one of the most popular rivers in the world. Its a wonderful introduction to the sport and a great way for anyone to get out and have fun without having to drive far. The South Fork is a great river for beginner, intermediate, and advanced rafters alike. There are two different runs on the South Fork: the upper Chili Bar run and the lower Gorge run. OA rafts both: the Gorge is run in Spring & Summer Chili Bar in the Fall). When the water is cold like (April, May & October) OA provides wetsuits for rafters. Check in with OA for all the details of things you should and should not bring on a rafting trip. South Fork trips are available every Saturday and Sunday, April through October. Private trips may also be arranged, either on the weekend or during the week.
  Klamath River 
 Klamath trips are three days long and thus allow you to experience a good mix of camping and rafting. The http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klamath_River Klamath features rapids up to class III and is good for rafters of all levels. This scenic river is located in the beautiful and rugged woods of northern California. Bald eagle and other wildlife spottings are not uncommon on Klamath trips. Excellent food is provided as well. Klamath trips take place over the threeday weekends of Memorial Day, Fourth of July, and Labor Day.
  North Fork of the American River 
 The bigger brother of the South Fork, this section is a step up in difficulty and is encouraged for intermediate to advanced rafters. Exhilarating Class IV rapids greet rafters during much of the journey and OA encourages people to have decent paddling experience before they sign up. Since trips are usually in spring and early summer, the water is quite cold and OA provides all rafters with wetsuits.  The North Fork is strictly dependent on water flows from snow melt since the river flows arent regulated by a dam. Hence, it is usually only runs in spring to early summer. After that, the flow tends to become too low for rafting. Exact trip dates vary from April to June.
  CalSalmon 
 This twoday trip is open to advanced rafters only as it is a Class V river. It is a 2day trip; oar boats may be the only type of raft used for this river. The http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmon_River_(California) CalSalmon is given that moniker as there is another Salmon River in Idaho that is also popular with rafters, though in a far more remote location. The CalSalmon is run twice each May, waterflow and weather dependent.

 Whitewater Kayaking 
 Brought back to the program by Jordy Margid in 2005, whitewater kayaking is an absolute blast. Classes are taught on the South Fork of the American River in the spring. This sport takes a fair amount of practice so its highly reccomended to go to a rolling clinic offered by Outdoor Adventures beforehand.  OA has a max student to teacher ratio of 3:1. Equipment that is provided on all trips: kayak, paddle, spray skirt, PFD, helmet, wetsuit and splash jacket.
  Open Rolling 
 OA provides access to the Rec Pool so you can practice your http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayak_roll kayak rolling. No instruction is provided. Open rolling is every Tuesday night, April through September.
  Kayak Rolling Clinics 
 OAs Rolling clinic is a twosession course and open to whitewater and sea kayakers alike. OA provides individual attention and the equipment. Clinics are offered frequently on concurrent Tuesdays, April through September.
  White Water Kayaking, Level I
 Open to all, this oneday course takes place on the Class II section of the South Fork of the American River. Classes are held April through September.
  White Water Kayaking, Level II
 This intermediate course is also one day, but meant for kayakers who have taken the Level I course and have taken the rolling clinic. Being able to roll is highly recommended. Classes are held April through September.

 Sailing 
Sailing is no longer offered at OA. OA used to partner with a campus department, to use their 40 yacht and offer educational trips to students. Trips took place in and around the San Francisco Bay.

 Sea Kayaking 
 OA has a fleet of 11 single and 5 double http://www.necky.com/ Necky sea kayaks. Transportation is provided on all trips, with special situation for Baja. Sea Kayaking Guide School is in May.
  Tomales Bay Day Tour 
 The focus of this trip is just to get out and have fun! Some instruction is provided (depending on what people want) but really youre just out there to explore. Youll likely be able to see jellyfish, sea stars, seals, birds, elk and lots of other wildlife. Trips are held a couple of times per quarter, year round.
  Introduction to Sea Kayaking 
 This class is designed for those who wish to learn the basic skills required to ocean kayak safely. The pretrip meeting covers a lot of material such as basics of navigation, planning and equipment. The day spent on http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomales_Bay Tomales Bay covers a large variety of skills including strokes, bracing and rescue. Trips are held about every other weekend, year round.
  Expedition Sea Kayaking 
 Similar kayaking skills are taught on this two day trip as on the one day Intro class. The major difference is that you will be camping out on a wonderfully secluded beach, so you will learn how to camp out of your kayak. This also gives you much more time to practice skills, explore the area and just relax. Trips are once or twice per quarter, year round. There is also a threeday option that takes place during winter  this simply you gives you more time to explore the coastline!
  San Francisco Bay Intermediate Tour 
 This tour is great for people who have some kayaking experience and want to do something a little more challenging. Most of the time, the trip launches from Sausilito and heads out towards Belvedere and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_Island,_California Angel Island. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay San Francisco Bay is a stunningly beautiful place to paddle. It can be a little challenging however. Strong currents, strong winds, boat traffic, fog and choppy water are all serious concerns. If conditions are right, you may have a chance to do a complete circumnavigation of Angel Island. Youll also get to paddle past some of the most valuable residential property in the world. This trip is offered once or twice per quarter, year round.
  Lake Tahoe 
 Spend a bluebird day exploring the dramatic shores of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerald_Bay_(Lake_Tahoe) Emerald Bay. This trip is open to all levels of kayakers and takes place during the summer.
 Ahjumawi Lava Springs
 This threeday adventure takes you up north of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Lassen Mt. Lassen to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahjumawi_Lava_Springs_State_Park Ahjumawi State Park.  A great place to paddle and explore the springs, cinder cones, and view some wildlife. Enjoyable for all levels of kayakers. This trip is offered over the threeday weekends of Memorial Day, Fourth of July, and Labor Day.
  Baja Sea Kayaking 
 Baja Sea Kayaking trips through OA are no longer offered due to travel warnings. This is a sixday trip launching from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahía_de_los_Ángeles Bahía de los Ángeles.  The drive is a little less than 2 days each way.  The itinerary varies from trip to trip, but there are a dozen or so campsites that you could visit including some beautiful white sand beaches, a dormant volcano, uninhabited islands and protected coves filled with clams.  The trip is not exclusively kayaking, as there are many opportunities to go Hiking and Backpacking hiking, snorkeling or just bumming around on the Beaches beach.  You are likely to see sea lions, migrating birds, fish, sting rays and possibly some dolphins or whales.  There are typically two trips over the winter break and two around spring break.

 Guide Schools 
A unique aspect to Outdoor Adventures is that they offer guide schools for each activity. Most university programs either contract out the guiding or have a generic guide school for all of their guides, who then must apprentice each activity. OA is large enough to offer sportspecific training. It can therefore be more thorough and comprehensive. Application will be available at OAs Rental Center in the weeks prior the guide school. Applicants may be called back to do an interview. Finally, the selected few will be allowed to register for this training. After guide school, TAs will need to get CPR and WFA (or WFR/EMT) certified, in addition to working as a TA on a few trips.
