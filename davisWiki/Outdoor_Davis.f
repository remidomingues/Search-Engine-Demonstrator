Outdoor Davis, now in its new location at the corner of  Second Street Second and F Street F Streets, is an outdoor sports shop dedicated to items for outdoor activities such as hiking and backpacking and living for all seasons.  They carry clothing and gear for kids, teens, and adults.

Outdoor Davis always has a welcoming water bowl outside their store and allows wellbehaved dogs inside the store.

They run a coupon in the little green machine, its usually 10$ off a $100 purchase, or 5 of $50 or sumat. I use it in the former fashion for money off vibrams, the only way Ive found to reduce the price at all...

Prior to their current location, they were at 232 E Street (in E Street Plaza).

This location was previously home to Samiras.

20061104 13:18:28 nbsp This place looks like they mostly sell tshirts. The old Alpine Supply on G Street where Volleys Tennis Shop is now was much better. Users/NickSchmalenberger
 20061104 13:37:59 nbsp The other place was called Alpine West. Users/JasonAller
   Apparently it was called Alpine Supply in the 70s, before being called Alpine West in the 80s (according to some list of stores selling Vasque boots in old issues of Backpacker magazine on google). That is before my time though, it was probably called Alpine West when I went there, so I must have gotten the name Alpine Supply from my mom or dad. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20061116 09:51:36 nbsp Visited this place a few weeks ago, and they mostly carry childrens stuff. Pretty limited selection, but consider the square footage of the place. Ill still shop in Sac for my outdoor gear, especially if Im plunking down a chunk of change for something like a backpack, where I need to test out several models. Users/AlphaDog

20070212 15:45:51 nbsp I was impressed.  Their stock has improved in the few months since my first visit.  They had seam grip and a nik wax substitute (what I was looking for) and they had go lite packs on sale %25 off.  So much better than going into Sac. Users/RobiPochapin

20070221 08:24:17 nbsp It was ok with some good stock but I found a site called http://www.upsideover.com that carried a larger selection specifically for kids. We outfitted our camp with the climbing harnesses. Users/StephenGilfus

20070224 19:57:29 nbsp I saw something in the Aggie about this place and checked them out.  I was impressed to see all the stuff they have for such a small store!  The lady working there was really helpful and even offered to special order items they didnt have instock.  They have a lot of clothing & camping equipment, It sure beats driving out to Sac. Users/MikeAdler

20080413 11:45:32 nbsp Its a small store, so obviously they dont have the selection that big boxes like REI have, although they are usually happy to order stuff for you. They have always been friendly and knowledgeable with me. I have found their prices to be pretty decent on a lot of items... I got a Nalgene for $8, which is as cheap as anywhere. The thing to keep in mind is that they really only carry namebrand stuff, which seems expensive compared to WalMart cheapo brand. But, in a lot of cases, you get what you pay for. Users/RyanCoates

20090110 06:45:23 nbsp It was a good store but what made it an excellent experience was the guy who was running the shop. Clement, I think his name was. He was very helpful in letting me know exactly what I needed and wasnt just trying to shove products down my throat. Though its a small store, they have a warehouse down 5th street with everything thats not still in stock. They had exactly what I needed and I was very satisfied :) Users/MattCorey

20090330 17:16:27 nbsp Everything i buy from this place gets stolen...their products must be good. Users/piratechef

20090813 17:23:50 nbsp new store is awesome! so glad there is an outdoor store in town! hopefully theyll get some some discount/return going. Users/WanderBee

20100130 14:33:52 nbsp I love the people that work here. Unfortunately their stock is limited compared to REI and such. I was looking for hiking shoes and although I didnt find what I wanted, the people were so helpful. Ill try and buy from here more often. Users/AlisaKim

20100718 13:26:13 nbsp I went in to get a upgrade doohickey for my camelbak, they had the drinking valve cover but no insulation ( I had to buy it from kens {{{;__;}}}) The lady behind the counter was super friendly, the store looked nice. Im going to be back for my outdoor needs!  Users/StevenDaubert

20110805 12:40:23 nbsp just got some vibrams from outdoor Davis, they were pretty sharp when it came to the sizing, and I got to use my 10 bucks off a $100 purchase from the green machine Users/StevenDaubert

20110923 14:37:35 nbsp Needed to buy some white crew socks for ROTC and saw this DavisWiki page. Upon arriving, I asked about what I needed and they had the item AND it was for sale. Not only that, but the salesman also told me about which products could also help me in my physical training. Recommended. Users/TiffanySun

20120714 12:12:20 nbsp As others have said, the people in this store are extremely nice and willing to answer any questions you might have.  There is a very nice selection of items given the size of the store, and you cant beat the convenience of having an outdoor store right in town.  Plus, they are dogfriendly! Users/CovertProfessor

20120723 23:46:42 nbsp Folks here are super nice, and very knowledgable. I wish they had a larger map/guidebook section. Users/CarlosOverstreet

20121023 19:27:12 nbsp The guys here are pretty nice and helpful, but I was a little disappointed by their prices. I needed a new bladder for my Camelbak, and it was about half the cost to get it at Big5, just across town.

And when my friend finally decided to get himself a camelbak, he saved a couple bucks by getting it at Kens Bike & Ski instead.

Not trying to rip on the place, its a nice store with nice people, but their prices are not very competitive.  Users/MasonMurray

20130217 17:42:05 nbsp I actually didnt find the staff all that helpful recently. Apparently theyve experienced a fair amount of shoplifting and, while they say hello to everyone when you walk in, after that youre on your own. They seem indifferent to customers, mostly just sitting at the desk and chatting to each other. Most customers came in, browsed for a minute and left, a few asked for items they didnt carry, and the ones seriously looking for things were thoroughly ignored. A few questions about products such as a book were met with blank stares. Given other readers compliments, it leaves me to wonder if maybe the weekend staff isnt the A team. I also heard the male cashier fussing to his colleague, who was ignoring about 5 customers, that Davis Wiki thinks that they only sell teeshirts. Actually they seem to sell mostly baby clothes.

Hi JaneBF,  Were sorry to hear about your poor experience recently.  This issue has been addressed with our staff and there will hopefully not be another incident like this.  Thank you for bringing it to our attention as our customer service is something we are known for, and I like to know if there is ever an issue.  Please never hesitate to contact the manager with any concerns.  Users/OutdoorDavis
