Outdoor Kids started as an Locally Owned Websites locally based internet business out of Jennys home in 1997, really before ecommerce was in full swing. At the time, Outdoor Kids was one of the few retailers that provided quality Outdoor Activities outdoor gear for kids at reasonable prices. In 2005, Jenny moved the business out of her home into a warehouse facility on Fifth Street. Upon moving into the office space on Fifth Street, they also opened a small retail store in the front part of the building. In August 2006, Outdoor Kids acquired a spot in downtown Davis at 232 E Street (former Avid Reader for Kids and Elements) and moved their retail store to that location, renaming the store Outdoor Davis Outdoor Davis. Outdoor Kids/Outdoor Davis still has their warehouse location on 5th Street Fifth Street where their internet business is still based. Because of the warehouse facility and internet business, Outdoor Davis customers benefit from a wide selection of equipment and clothing, regardless of the time of year.
