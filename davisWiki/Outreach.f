20070930 11:17:45 nbsp Can your laptop play the presentation at wiki:wikispot:Presentations/General_Audience? Users/JasonAller
   my laptop can play that, yes. but i wonder if people will want to go through the 16 slides at farmers market.
   The slides are great, but I agree with Jessica that facetoface communication and small flyers/stickers work best at this kind of thing.

20070930 12:37:25 nbsp I will table, and can bring a table maybe, but more importantly I want to be paid in stickers and I want to be able to give out stickers. let me know. Users/PxlAted

20070930 13:20:44 nbsp I dont have any more of the Davis Wiki stickers  there was much talk about producing a Wiki Sticker/StickiWiki Design Contest a new design, but most of the entries didnt work as real (cheap) stickers.  Reprinting the original design is probably a good idea, but I dont have the spare $100 or so to print em right now.  Theres a lot of people who want stickers, so itd be a worthwhile thing for someone to spend money on, I think  just use a design you find (I suggest the original or inverted designs on the design contesst page)  and print them up someplace (I used http://123stickers.com in the past).

Ive got a bunch of Wiki Spot stickers, which would be good for a table but in of themselves not really as relevant as Davis Wiki stickers.

I dont have any more wiki shirts.  I forget who has the silk screen  either Kristen Birdsall or Rob Roy.  Users/PhilipNeustrom

20070930 17:38:48 nbsp wikispot stickers would be better than nothing to give out and since there are no more davis stickers I withdraw my request for payment. :) I would also contribute $10 to a new sticker run of the old design but am too poor to bankroll the printing myself. Users/PxlAted

20071004 16:57:25 nbsp if anyone wants to use the wiki fish sign, just let me know. Users/PxlAted

20071104 15:28:40 nbsp Hi all, Ive been away from the interweb as of late but I still have several ideas for Davis wiki outreach. I will post several ideas when I get a more stable connection Users/StevenDaubert

20071108 09:28:55 nbsp I hope this isnt too offtopic, but Ive been exploring what it would take to get a wiki started in my own local community. User participation and community engagement seems to be one of the main sticking pointsand outreach is definitely a large component of this. Im a big believer in the attraction model of recruitment (focus on enthusiastic participation and others will be drawn to you!), but obviously getting the word out helps. Id love to help contribute ideas about this, and, obvious, to hear whats worked for you.  Users/Siona
  Hello, if you wanted to get a wiki started, the actual wiki itself can be gotten via wiki:wikispot Wikispot which is the same software we use here, made bigger to allow for multiple wikis for everyone to create for their communities, free of charge and all that jazz. The most difficult thing for this is to get the community outreach, get people to add content so the ball gets rolling,  other folk will likely add more in this regard. Where is the community by the way? ~DavePoole

20071207 10:19:31 nbsp In Discussing some issues with how to get people to participate one idea came to mind: Each Wikizen goes forth and converts 2 new wikizens by asking them to make 2 edits on the wiki and then find 2 more people to make 2 more edits each... Users/AlexMandel
  Sorta like a pay it forward.. but what if I get trolled in the end? Not bad but it lacks the oomph of motivation, why should folk do this. Perhaps a general campaign to capture more viewers as users, because most people know but dont add, perhaps then we should really promote signing in and adding something about what davis means to the person, too idealistic? ~D
  I was thinking such a thing should be done for inviting people to our next wiki gathering/bbq.  Users/JessicaRockwell

20080802 07:15:02 nbsp Weve offered to do a feature story on the Davis Wiki and a handful of the main members contributing to the site. We just need to know who those people are and have them contact us and be available for interviews and photographs. Check out the magazine at www.davislifemagazine.com. Weve also offered to link stories we do to the appropriate Wiki pages so that you have more info, quotes and photos for each page that weve done a story on, we just need someone willing to enter this each month. Users/CaryArnold

20090507 12:04:33 nbsp I need stickers, and this event should be repeated. With the cycling of UCD students every few years it is important to keep the wiki spreading or else all the people that know about it will move away!  Obviously not EVERYBODY but you get the point.   Users/MasonMurray

20091214 09:21:33 nbsp I remember seeing some flyers up for the Wiki when I was an undergrad.  I havent been on campus much lately, but I havent seen any of the flyers in a long time.  Are they still being put up anywhere?

Also, are stickers, flyers, or anything of that sort given out to local businesses that are interested?  Quite a few of the businesses are active on the Wiki, and I imagine those with generally good press on here would be delighted to put up some sort of a Look us up on daviswiki.org sign or sticker.  Good for businesses, good for community attention.

Another thought, has anyone looked into getting a plug in, e.g., one of the little coupon mailers that go out?  I dont know if the Little Green Coupon Machine would be interested, but it seems conceivable.  Likewise with that marketplace mailing that goes out in (at least) North Davis.  If people are going to the wiki to look up store hours and reviews on the businesses that advertise there, its free press for the businesses and free press for the wiki. Users/TomGarberson

   wiki flyer Flyers have always been kinda a DIY thing  if you want them up, print some out (or make some new ones!) and put them up!  We definitely could use some newer flyers (3,300 articles and counting! oh dear!)  As far as stickers go, I know Users/WilliamLewis did a printing run a while back.  William, did those come out okay?  If I sent you some $ would you be willing to do another run?  Users/PhilipNeustrom
  Ehh... I was waiting for more people to pitch in, but nobody ever did. I should do it anyway. wl

20091214 12:21:06 nbsp I / we can pay for it if you wanna just do an order of, say, 500 I will reemburse you Users/PhilipNeustrom
 A run of 500 sounds fine. Its $46+shipping... I was going to pay half of that. Ill order after I get off work.
   Thats for stickers?  How about some Wiki Spot ones?  jw
     I have a crapload of wiki spot stickers that I never gave out.  Will distribute to Davis soon.

20100616 15:24:47 nbsp It seems like this would be a good time to return to tabling at the farmers market.  Plus, theres a freshman orientation coming up in a couple of months!   There will also be intro weeks/orientations for the professional schools  law and vet for sure, and Im assuming business and med.Users/TomGarberson

20101010 19:07:58 nbsp If you need stickers, were down to supply them on the house.  Check out: http://www.stickermule.com/  Users/AnthonyThomas
