 The Best Towns in the U.S.; The New American Dream Towns 

Think Utopia doesnt exist? Maybe not yet  but these ten towns are making a play for perfection with adventurefriendly innovation and cool ideas for building smart communities. Plus the hottest concepts in urban revival, combating sprawl, and better hometown living.

Welcome to the Neighborhood
Weve found a new way of living

IMAGINE YOU HAD THE CHANCE TO INVENT A PERFECT TOWN from scratch. You could choose whatever features you wanted to make it a stimulating and satisfying place to live, and borrow liberally from the best of what other cities have to offer. Anything goes: You might start with French Quarter streets lined with paintedlady Victorians from Adventures Outside of Davis San Francisco. Maybe a Putah Creek river runs through it, with bridges and banks very much like the Seines  except for the Class III rapids in the whitewater park downtown. Solarpowered streetcars whisk commuters through lush greenbelts to art deco office towers, whose exterior walls double as climbing gyms. Theres free valet parking for bicycles on every block and a freerange chicken in every pot.

Creating an exquisitely livable town, of course, isnt quite that simple. But its not a fantasy, either. When we combed the country for the sweetest innovations and the freshest ideas for making neighborhoods better places to live, work, and playwith tons of green space, easy access to the outdoors, and bigthink visions for smarter, more sustainable everyday livingwe hit the jackpot. Plenty of real American cities, we found, are taking positive steps to soften the rough edges of our highoctane daytoday. Communities of all sizes are waking up and relearning old lessons: That many residents want the option of walking or biking to get from A to B. That locals will swarm to a towns natural assetsits shoreline or lakefront, riverbank or foothillsif the paths and piers welcome them. And that change starts with a willingness to look hard at your weaknesses and then play to your strengths. Your towns paperflat, like Davis, California? Build a network of bike lanes and paths. It rains a lot in Portland, Oregon? Transform urban rooftops into gardens of native plants.

To spotlight the new American dream towns, we started with a wish list of criteria: commitment to open space, smart solutions to sprawl and gridlock, cando community spirit, and an active embrace of the adventurous life. We looked for green design and greenthinking mayors, thriving Farmers Market farmers markets and healthy job markets. We found it alland then some: ten towns that might tempt you to box up your belongings, plus nine more whose bright ideas are well worth stealing. Check out these shining prototypes for what a 21stcentury townwhat your hometown, perhapscan be: cleaner, greener, smarter. Better.

Davis, California

POPULATION: 65,000 // MEDIAN AGE: 25 // MEDIAN HOME PRICE: $333,000 // AVERAGE COMMUTE: 20.6 min.

If more developments resembled Daviss Village Homes project, subdivision might not be such a dirty word. Trees shade the narrow streets, keeping the asphalt (and air) cooler during the hot Central Valley summers than in less enlightened housing tracts. Nearly 75 percent of the communitys 225 houses use solar power, reducing furnace heat in the winter. And its all linked by broad common spaces, winding pathways, and  heres a term you dont hear enough  edible landscaping: community vineyards and orchards yielding grapes, persimmons, cherries, almonds, and peaches. No town gives more leeway to bicycles: 51 miles of Bike Paths paths and 50 miles of bike lanes (among the first in the nation); special biketraffic signals at intersections; even http://www.biketalkradio.com/ BikeTalk on KDRTFM (KDirt). Citizen involvement is high on the list of civic values: The Worst Intersection In Davis Rush hour in Davis, goes a local truism, happens just before 7 p.m., when people are scurrying to their committee meetings.

PROGRESSIVE CRED:  If youre tall, dark, and herbaceous, this is your kind of town. Davis maintains a http://cityofdavis.org/pcs/trees/landmark.cfm Landmark Tree List and a http://cityofdavis.org/pcs/trees/master.cfm Master Street Tree List  as well as 31 parks, 20 the greenbelt greenbelts, and a 400acre manmade Vic Fazio Yolo Wildlife Area wetland. To compensate for every acre of farmland built upon, developers must preserve two acres of comparable land in its place. Culture gets a nod, too: 1 percent of all capitalimprovement funds is set aside for public art such as Town Art sculptures. And Central Park Central Parks yearround Farmers Market farmers market, says Mitch Sears, Daviss openspace planner, is a community touchstone.

LIVABILITY:  UC Davis, which employs one out of every three residents, keeps the local scene young and diverse. Land trusts, nonprofits, and green research programs, such as the National Institute for Global Environmental Change, abound. Daviss proximity to the Bay Area and the Sierra Nevada means that anything you can do on water, snow, rock, or dirt is never far away.

I Love Davis YOULL LOVE IT IF:  In the standard American turf wars  bike vs. SUV, farm vs. strip mall  you always root for the underdog.
