Amid the vast farmlands on the outskirts of the City of Davis, some very interesting places are to be found. Some of the roads that come into and go out of town (thereby passing through the outskirts) include:

  Drummond Avenue  enters south Davis and ends in a tbone with Lillard Drive which then becomes Mace Blvd
  Highway 113  heads toward our northern neighbors in Woodland and connects with Interstate 80 I80 in the south
  Interstate 80  connects Davis to the east and west coasts
  Old Davis Road  becomes California Avenue before it enters Campus from the south
  Russell Russell Blvd  runs from Davis towards our western neighbors in Winters
  See also the hefty list of County Roads county roads

Beyond the outskirts, you may find Adventures Outside of Davis adventure.

Ranches to be found around Davis include Mace Ranch and Wildhorse Ranch.
