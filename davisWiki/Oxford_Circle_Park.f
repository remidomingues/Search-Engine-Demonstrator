Oxford Circle Park is also known as Little Big Peoples Park. Its awesome. Its got a playground thats like a regular playground except, well, big. Theres a giant geometriclike pyramid with ropes to climb on and a weird thing that looks sort of like its supposed to be a basketball hoop and a hammock and a secret hideout in the air that spins(reminiscent of those torture cages but nevertheless very fun). There used to be this slide where people pee and a fireman pole and a bunch of other crap (see below). Of course, theres also a lot of grass.

One of the greatest things to play on at the playground is the merrygoroundyou know the type, the kind they have to remove because too many kids end up flying off of them. Nevertheless, the Big Peoples merrygoround is not for the faint of heart, nor for the sober. It is a highly popular location for the inebriated or people under the influence of a certain herbal treat.  The merrygoround is also sometimes referred to as the Mega Mobile. But either way, the Big Peoples Park can be enjoyed by those both big and small, so check it out sometime!


Most of the current equipment (one may notice a striking difference between the wooden tower and swings and the new stuff) was put in over the summer of 2002, replacing a weird disintigrating tirehammockthing. Users/KrisFricke would like to mention he was one of three people actively involved in choosing the current equipment, while on the City Renovations subCommittee for the park in the spring of 2002.

During Spring Quarter, the grass is filled with sunbathing students. Users/KenBloom wishes the park were not filled with nearly naked sunbathers.  Others dont mind as much.  Sometimes random drunk college girls will walk through this park and try to make out with you.  This is best to be avoided, no matter how appealing it may seem at the time.

The Big Kids Park also has a nine hole Disc Golf course.

 Old wooden structure 


The wooden playstructure in the park was removed on June 20, 2005.  The reasoning behind this move was that the the structure does not meet current safety standards and cannot be modified to meet them.  The structure was mostly wooden, and was extremely high off the ground.  There were two slides: a yellow, plastic spiral slide, and a metal, straight slide.  The structure was also home to a firemanstyle slide pole, which was quite fun to slide down because it was so high up.


The only wooden structure left is the swings.

20060504 18:59:59 nbsp Does anyone know what the rules are for using the barbecues? If we needed to reserve them for a day would we go talk to Student Housing or...? Users/AngelaPourtabib
  It is a city park. Users/NickSchmalenberger
  First come, first serve. You dont need to reserve for anything in the city park Users/SimonFung
  Technically, the picnic area with BBQs can be reserved, so its not first come first serve if there is an advance reservation.  You can call Community Services Department Community Services before youre going to use it to see if anyone is going to be there. Users/Community Services

20061009 12:57:42 nbsp Man... one of my favorite offthebeatentrack quirky fun things about Davis is now ruined. Screw you, City of Davis. Whats next? Are the giant dominoes going because people might trip and hit their heads on them? I LOVED the slides. Pure unadulterated kidstyle goofiness, all taken away because some bureaucrat got nervous. By they way, Im fully aware that Im unreasonably upset about this, but it really did make me feel like a kid who got his candy stolen by a stranger. Oh well. Users/BigDave

20090324 15:44:20 nbsp I miss the old tall wooden structure. It was scary high, and fun! It seems like someones always closing the cool high places. Like the top outdoor floor at the Death Star on campus.  That was the coolest view in Davis.  Then they blocked it off with some door. It just tempts me to climb around it, which is really dangerous!

20090818 01:58:29 nbsp Anything that is fun and dangerous usually gets removed by city, county, state, and government officials due to liability.

Stuff like this usually gets removed because someone was stupid enough to injure themselves on the equipment and actually try to sue the city for their idiocy. Users/IdealParadigm
