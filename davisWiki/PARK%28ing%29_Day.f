PARK(ing) Day is a worldwide event which occurs on the 3rd Friday each September.

The mission of PARK(ing) Day is to call attention to the need for more urban open space, to generate critical debate around how public space is created and allocated, and to improve the quality of urban human habitat â€¦ at least until the meter runs out!

A report on Daviss first PARK(ing) Day in 2012 by users/EfremRensi Efrem Rensi:

Parking day was a success.  I ended up having a real lawn, due to extra sod the Davis Friends Meeting Davis Friends had from a recent installation.  I borrowed 5 rolls of sod from them.  I cruised around downtown and found a spot at 3rd & F, right in front of Wheelworks.   Its two hour parking there.  I rolled out the sod and it was just enough to cover a parking space.  I laid out a beach towel and sat for a while and had a lunch from the sandwich shop around the corner.  I displayed the sign users/angel.york Angel made.  I wasnt sure if I should have it facing the cars or the pedestrians on the sidewalk.

I got a few waves and some confused glances.  A few people asked me questions about Parking Day, such as, what is it?  I was not able to give a clear explanation about the official cause.   I personally enjoyed the performance art aspect of it, but I did not feel a connection with the larger cause.

I was approached by a parking attendant who was not sure what to do about me.  I told him I was parked and since its two hour parking then I should have two hours.  I did stay parked there for about two hours, after which I was approached by police police officers who asked what I was doing and told me to leave.   One officer explained to me that when he was young, people knew what what they were protesting.

That aside, Im sure I drew some attention to Parking Day, and some to myself.  If there was any point to this then the future will tell, but I had an interesting few hours. Apparently, according to the Parking Day website, this is how the very first one went.  If I do this again Ill definitely be better prepared and informed.
