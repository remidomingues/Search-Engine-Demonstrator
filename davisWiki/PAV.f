I checked out your website and I think it could be good with some work, but at the moment it runs rather slow and the pricing and reviews for restaurants seemed somewhat arbitrary. I would advise, though, that you read the Welcome to the wiki/business owner page to see how you can make an entry for your website without resorting to putting up comments that may be deleted. Good luck! Users/JoePomidor
