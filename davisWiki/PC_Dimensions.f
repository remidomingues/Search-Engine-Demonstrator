PC Dimensions was a computer store located in Downtown Davis, in half of the space currently occupied by the Alphabet Moon toy store.  In addition to building and selling highquality custom PCs, the store maintained a modest selection of computer parts, software, and accessories.  Its computer repair service was held in high regard, even after the F Street store closed on relatively short notice and operations temporarily moved to a thenvacant medical office at 765 West Covell Boulevard  In 1999, its warranty obligations and computer repair service were transferred to Integrated Technology Partners, a Fairfieldbased telephony and computer networks consulting firm.
