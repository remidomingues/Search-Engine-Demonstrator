Once a popular LAN center, Bloodstrike closed its doors in 2005.  It has been replaced by Davis Judo Kai.


Being the son of Bob Jacobs, coowner of J & J Auto Service, I loved bloodstrike.  I could pop over there whenever I wanted to and squeeze off a few rounds to take care of some aggression.  I am really sad to see that place go.  I wish nothing but the best for the Lee family, and hope their next business venture is more successful. ~users/JosephJacobs
