20120512 21:12:18 nbsp I emailed Rich at PC Medic Mobile for help with ongoing computer problems Id been having and to discuss whether it was time for a new computer or just an upgrade. Rich responded to my message almost immediately and was able to come to my house as soon as it was convenient for me.  Rich was professional, efficient, knowledgeable and, most importantly, able to explain to me what was going on at every step of the way. My computer diagnostic skills are limited to restarting the computer, so I appreciated his patience for translating tech speak into something I could understand. After a thorough hardware and operating system check Rich helped me develop the most cost effective plan to get and keep me computing happily as quickly and cheaply as possible.  The whole experience was worth every penny and sooo much nicer than dealing with someone at a call center halfway around the world. In the end, Im sure Rich saved me more money than I would have spent at a retail store or through a call center tech. Users/JoaquinFeliciano

20120917 10:39:27 nbsp Rich built me a great gaming computer. Hes excellent at answering all my questions clearly, and patiently. Really seems to care about his customers. If anything goes wrong with my computers, hes the first one I call! Users/DianaTaylor

20120917 17:49:30 nbsp Rich at PC Medic Mobile helped me select a new laptop  my first!  He set everything up, ensuring a simple and easy process for me.  When it eventually started running more slowly, Rich did a check up and got it running smoothly and quickly again. Recently, I cracked the screen and once again contacted Rich.  He replaced it at a very reasonable cost, and saved me from having to purchase a whole new laptop.  The service was fast, professional and, best of all, affordable!  I highly recommend PC Medic Mobile.  Users/PatriciaKurata

20121211 08:55:34 nbsp I had my Asus laptop go completely unresponsive on me.  I called Rich for an appointment and he responded almost immediately.  He was incredibly helpful and polite during the tuneup, and I thought the cost was very reasonable.  I will definitely call him if I need computer help again. Users/samwall

20121214 12:10:52 nbsp Rich did a great job restoring my pc that was heavily infected with viruses! Got it back quickly and it was like brand new! He answered all my questions very clearly! He was professional and affordable! Thank you Rich! Users/StevenParker

20121228 20:13:29 nbsp I emailed Rich on Christmas Eve with the expectation that he would get back to me after the holidays.  He called me within a half hour and was out on the 26th to diagnose the problems (corrupted OS).  He offered me lots of options, including how to fix it myself if I wanted to try that repair first.  He returned the computer less then 48hrs later in good working order, having done more then promised.  He is definitely the first person I will call when I need to fix or buy a new computer. Users/ChristopherRyan

20130108 21:03:24 nbsp I emailed Rich for help after my computer started freezing after 5 minutes of use. He responded to my email and was able to set up an appointment with me within an hour. Rich was very helpful in walking me through the diagnostic and showing me each step that he was taking to figure out the problem. It turned out my computer had a corrupted OS and also way too many programs running at startup. He took my computer home and returned it the next day just in time before the quarter started. He ran into some problems putting Microsoft Office back onto my computer (which was not his fault), but made the extra effort to solve this issue, which I really appreciated. Rich also made great suggestions about how I can maintain my computer in good condition in the future. He was very responsible, patient, friendly, reassuring, and helpful throughout the whole process. He is definitely the first person that I will call for computer issues or for computer knowledge in general. He was affordable for a college students budget as well with his student discount and returning customer discounts!

20130203 20:44:18 nbsp Recently, I hired Rich of PC Medic Mobile to try to rescue my old (5+ years) Dell laptop computer after it crashed. I learned about him via the Davis Wiki, and in short, I thought he was outstanding. I left a voicemail for him; he returned my call within 20 minutes, and came by my house that same afternoon to take a look at my computer. After diagnosing the problem, he explained to me that it was fixable, but that the fix was very labor intensive (it involved disassembling the whole laptop to replace a single worn out part) and therefore costly. Given that my computer was also fairly old, as well as damaged (previously, Id dropped it, and busted one of its hinges), we decided that it wasnt costeffective to try and save it, and so I opted to simply replace it instead. Thankfully, though, Rich was able to recover my old data from my hard drive, and he even gave me a couple of generous discounts cause I was a student, and cause I didnt have a lot of data on my hard drive to rescue. The two services he provided (diagnosis and data recovery) cost me in total $130. In addition to that, Rich gave me a lot of information and advice about what to look for when picking out a new laptop, and even said I could contact him via email if I wanted his opinion on my final choice. Overall, I thought Rich was very personable, professional, organized, capable, and informative, and I wouldnt hesitate to call him again or to recommend him to anyone else. Users/DumindraGurusinghe

20130214 17:11:07 nbsp Rich provided great starttofinish support.  With no fuss or muss, he diplomatically filled in my many gaps in tech knowledge during the purchase and installation of my computer system, and tailored the system to my needs. Rich easily located and transferred the data from my old (dead)computer. He had me back to telecommuting within a day  and with far less hassle and cost than a big box store. Plus, Rich is a nice guy, easy to get along with and down to earth. He was recommended to me, and now I recommend him. Users/litil

20130410 14:45:32 nbsp Rich was phoenominal!  He answered his phone, first time, made an appointment for the next day, he was on time, AMAZING!!! I feel so refreshed!! My computer is working faster and cleaner.  He transferred some files from my PC to my new MAC, fixed internet issues and installed some drivers! I absolutely recommend him!   Users/kiverson

20130917 10:57:40 nbsp Rich was terrific! Prompt, professional, and very reasonably priced.  He charged one rate for the job, even though it took way longer than expected due to complicating factors in our system.  He walked me through everything he was doing and pointed out other issues I wasnt aware of and how to handle them. Definitely knows his stuff. Would highly recommend and will use again.  Users/TrinaMcMorrow

20140717 18:27:15 nbsp Rich did a great job fixing my laptop. I had a couple of issues...one being my laptop screen was completely broken off its hinges, secondly I broke the internal piece where the adapter plugs into the laptop. He was able to fix everything 100% and had it back to me within few days. (Only because he had to order parts which also turned out extremely inexpensive). I highly recommend using his services. Very professional and super friendly.  Users/LakeeshiaBrooks
