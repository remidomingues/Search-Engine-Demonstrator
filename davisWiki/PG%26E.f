This is the local office for Pacific Gas & Electric, the fine people who bring you your energy through pipes and wires. In April 2005, the Yolo County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to begin the annexation process to have SMUD (Sacramento Municipal Utility District) provide electricity to Davis, Woodland, West Sacramento and unincorporated areas of the Yolo County county instead of PG&E. The SMUD board of directors voted May 19, 2005 on whether to annex this area into its electricity service. SMUD ratepayers but not Yolo County ratepayers voted down an annexation proposal in 2006 that would have extended SMUDs territory to include Davis, Woodland, West Sacramento and the area between the cities. The local PG&E office was previously at 707 4th Street Suite 200, where the McCormick Building now stands, but the building was pwned by a tree so they moved to the current location.

I used to pay my bill at the office right up until they closed. I never did see a tree fall on the office. They posted notices about their move to Cousteau Place well in advance of their planned closure date. Perhaps the tree fell on the building just after they moved out. Users/MaxLucas

  /History

PG&E declared bankruptcy on April 6, 2001 due to their flawed business practices. Governor Gray Davis arranged a multibillion dollar bailout of PG&E. The multibillion dollar bailout is one of many factors that led to Governor Gray Davis eventual recall. Today, PG&E customers still bear the burden of this bailout in the form of above average electricity rates. This has continued for years and will most likely continue for some time.

4.8 million PG&E customers will pay between $7 billion and $8 billion of PG&Es bankruptcyrelated costs. That is an average of $1,458 to $1,667 per customer over nine years. This payment appears as a nonbypassable surcharge on monthly electric bills averaging $162 to $185/year ($14 to $15/month). This has led to higher monthly electric bills for millions of people.

Many people still feel animosity towards PG&Es corrupt management that is responsible for its terrible business decisions and multibillion dollar debt. Customers will still be paying PG&Es debts far into the future.

Baseline PG&E rates in September, 2009:
Natural gas (methane): $0.96476/therm ($.032927/kWh or 109.333MJ/$)
Electricity: $0.11531/kWh ($31.220MJ/$)
  This is the reason to heat with gas instead of electricity; electricity costs 3.5 times as much as gas.

Gas meters measure volume and are calibrated in 100s of cubic feet (Ccf), but PG&E bills you in energy, measured in therms. Convert volume to energy by multiplying by the conversion factor (1.028123 therm/Ccf PG&E natural gas).

Volume: 100 cubic feet  1 Ccf  2.8316846592 cu. meters of natural gas contains approximately 1.028123 therm  102812.3 BTU  108.472719MJ  30.1313108 kWh of energy and costs $.991892.
Energy: 1 therm  100,000 BTU  105.4804MJ â‰ˆ 29.300111kWh which costs $.96476 is contained in approximately 97.2646269 cubic feet (Ccf)  2.75422752 cu. meters of natural gas.

  In essence, your gas meter reads dollars.

Rough energy calculations:
Itll cost you approx. 1 cent to burn up a cubic foot of gas, but you get 1 megajoule  of energy when you do so. 1 MJ (megajoule) is 1 million watts for one second. This is a good deal, considering itll cost you 3.5 cents to get that same megajoule in electricity. PG&E uses the US therm (different than the European Unions value, of course) for gas energy, its equal to 105.4804 megajoules (approx. 29.3kWh). For reference, a gallon of gasoline yields 135 MJ; at $3.00/gallon thats 45 MJ/$.

You used to be able to pay your PG&E bill at Ace Hardware (the southern housewares building) until 6 pm daily.  As of 2006, this is no longer the case. Kims Asian Food is no longer listed as a payment center as of 2011.

Things to remember when using this option:

     Bring your bill or 11 digit account number with you.
     Retain the receipt for your records (you will need this if you call us about your payment).
     Authorized Neighborhood Payment Centers only accept cash, check or money order for payment
     Payments made by 5 p.m. post to your account on the same day


20050517 17:45:16 nbsp Davis residents would stand to benifit with a transition from PG&E to SMUD. SMUD is publically owned and managed with an elected board and they have more investment in renewable energy sources. Users/MikeSiminitus

20080313 14:44:42 nbsp I would like to know if anyone else is getting suspicious charges on their PG&E billsour gas usage bill mysteriously more than quadrupled even though we didnt change our usage at all. I know gas prices increase this year and baseline gas prices increase during the winter, but it probably shouldnt jump up $80 when usage (without running the heater, btw) remained the same...

Please start a dialog if youve had the same problem...there could be something fishy here, since it wouldnt be the first time PG&E hasnt been completely honest... Users/Julianna
   It could just be that the meter reader read something incorrectly.  It is pretty common and usually fixed with a quick phone call.  What did they say when you contacted them? Users/JabberWokky

20081105 19:41:32 nbsp The perfect example of why a monopoly is horrible for customers. Horrible F$(#$#king customer service, terrible accounting practices.  Strongarm tactics to force customers to settle or face shutoff.  Impossible to reach real people at times who can actually answer anything. After the gas shut off in South Davis they forget to actually turn my back on.  Today I call and they tell me sure they will come Sometime today.  I leave work at 12:30 per PG&Es advice and now at 7:39 I finally get a call saying they will be here to turn the gas on after they shut if off.  I have more to tell but its impossible to condense into a short story, but basically when SMUD comes back on the ballot I encourage all to vote for the opportunity to have competition in our electric and gas provider as PG&E has F%$#(ked me so bad over the years.  Waste hours of my day because they cant narrow down an appointment only for them to show up 20 minutes to 8pm.  They cant narrow down appointments to better than an 8 hour window??? give me a break..  Who else could stay in business with this type of service model???   Users/loneshark
  http://law.onecle.com/california/civil/1722.html California Civil Code 1722 requires them to give you a four hour window, and provides for damages (not to exceed $600) if they fail to show in that window.  That only governs new contracts.  Service restorations have different rules, but they should still honor a four hour appointment.

20090108 21:30:19 nbsp Re:Julianna, I too had a HUGE bill last month and another this month.  For the month of October, my bill was $275 when it should have been around $50(I live in a small apartment with no washer/dryer)and had barely used any appliances that month. l called PG and E and the girl on the phone asked me if I had had any parties or guests, as if that would account for the $275 bill.  After an hour and a half of not getting anywhere with her, I decided to go in and talk to an actual person who might be able to help me.  The man at the PG and E office I dealt with was pleasant enough, but the woman who also helped me was not.  She again tried to make it seem like my bill was normal, but told me theyd look into it.  I later received a bill for $90.  I paid that (even though it was still too high) only to find that my next bill was for close to $400!!  I went in again, and as I explained that my bill could in no way shape or form be correct, she actually rolled her eyes at me.  I am still dealing with this mess.  Somethings going on here for sure.

20090812 16:20:08 nbsp PG&E has horrible business practices, they overcharge, and they will lie to their customers in order to get a little bit of money. If SMUD comes back on the ballot, I am voting for them. There needs to be some competition in Davis, same goes for Comcast. Users/IdealParadigm
  If it ever makes it back to the ballot it wouldnt introduce competition, it would switch from a for profit utility to a publicly owned utility. So it wouldnt introduce competition, but it would take the profit motive out of the mix. Users/JasonAller

20110401 06:54:16 nbsp Alright.. I suppose I will play devils advocate on this one. I have had pretty decent experiences with PGE over the past couple of years. I received several bills that did seem a bit high and, after investigation, found there to be a leak in the gas main leading to my apartment. They fixed the leak, reduced the bills and I also had them shut off the gas to my apartment altogether since A) I am almost always in my room when in my apartment and B) when the heater is on it does not heat the bedrooms unless you leave the doors open, which I never do... So, I never use the heater anyway.

Last year, I was laid off from work and discussed the issue with PGE. PGE helped me set up a plan to maintain my utilities, making delayed payments with no overcharges or extra fees and treated me with respect even though I felt like a less than for months after being laid off.

Every time I have to speak to anyone at PGE I have always been greeted with friendly and professional attitudes and intelligent responses. Perhaps things have changed over the past year or two, I dont know. What I do know is that it seems my experience with them is rare if the above comments are to be taken at face value. Users/WesP
