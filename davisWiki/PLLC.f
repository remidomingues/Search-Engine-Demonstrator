Describe Users/PLLC here.


20090208 17:41:34 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. Please dont Creative Hair delete pages or peoples comments. If you have a comment or minor change for the page, please do so, but eliminating the entire page without explaining why is disruptive. Users/robinlaughlin

20090208 17:43:40 nbsp Howdy! I keep reverting your edits because the page is already doing fine on its own and doesnt need to be remade. By the way, you share the same IP address as Users/KC, which is pretty solid evidence that you and they are the same person. That sort of thing is generally frowned on around here, because pretending to be more than one person is kinda unethical. Hope all this helps you understand why there have been reverts and such on the Creative Hair page. Users/JoePomidor

20090208 17:45:56 nbsp Ah, also, I have been making sure that the comments put on the page have the proper attribution of who said them. This is important since the wiki allows people to change pretty much any content on a page, and so the only real stamp of veracity is ones name. This means a comment without a name means nothing, and so will either be attributed to the person who actually said it, or deleted. Users/JoePomidor

20090208 17:48:12 nbsp It looks like KC and PLLC were both editing from the same IP address. It could be that they are both the same pseudonymous person? If that is the case they may just be removing their own comment. Situations like this can be avoided by Importance of using your RealName using your real name. Users/JasonAller

20090208 18:00:36 nbsp Hallo again, The best summation I can give as far as comments go is, its ok to edit or delete your own, no matter what page. The big thing is just not to edit other peoples comments, as that tends to offend. However, it is OK to delete other peoples comments on your user page if you so desire. I deleted your comments off my page, since that seemed to be what you were asking for, but in the future you can do that sort of thing too by clicking the edit button at the top of any given page, next to the title.
