20081013 19:47:49 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. Over time the Wiki Community has gotten pretty good at spotting what we refer to as sockpuppets; users who create more than one account and comment on or edit the same pages in an attempt to make their opinions seem as though they are held by many more people. The best response if you are caught in the appearance of being a sockpuppet is to introduce yourself and contribute in a positive manner to pages other than the one youve been editing.
