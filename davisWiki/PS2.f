20080528 19:56:50 nbsp Hey, Paul. I did revert/change a couple of your entries so I wanted to give you an explanation. It seemed like you removed quite a bit of the negative information. While it is negative, it is also true. I was at the meetings and know some of the folks involved. I was wondering why you chose to delete it? Is it a question about it being true?

Feel free to send me a message back...

20080528 22:21:22 nbsp Hey, I agree that in the scheme of life these things are not all that important. However, as phillip said, there is no reason to delete it. Sure it is a little negative, but people have to live with what they did. Check out my page, being an ASUCD senator isnt much, but by having that info out there it provides a history, and lessons on what not to do for future students. I was involved via mediaboard (I was an designee at the time) Users/AndrewPeake

20080528 22:39:13 nbsp it means I went to meetings on behalf of someone who was on the board. I later was a rep. Media Board oversees the aggie and kdvs. Did you work at the paper? Users/AndrewPeake

20080529 01:06:12 nbsp Hey thanks for all the new info about Aggie stuff. My uncle used to live in Martinez... what do you do there? Users/JeremyOgul

20080529 09:04:42 nbsp Hey, I read what you http://daviswiki.org/Users/PhilipNeustrom?actiondiff&at_date1212035730.2655101 wrote on Philips page. I do think its interesting and important to have all the details; this is a wiki, not an abridged dictionary for Davis. Maybe its not a resource you could quote in a paper but its helpful in giving visitors and residents a relevant history and background of Davis. Unfortunately sometimes negative things happen but that doesnt mean we should censor them.  Users/ElleWeber

20080529 14:42:46 nbsp Things on this website have appeared in articles about me over the years. While the Aggie Ed board revolves continuously, the wiki provides a certain amount of institutional memory. For better or for worse info here stay forever  which I think is a great resource so we can all learn from past mistakes or resurrect old ideas that never came to fruition. Id like to take back a few things Ive said over the years because I have since either learned better, or my intent was lost, etc. But live and let live. And let the wiki admins worry about bandwidth usage and storage capacity. Users/RobRoy
