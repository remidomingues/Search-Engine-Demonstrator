With campus real estate crunch, the university started moving service units off campus in the late nineties. Repro Graphics was the first unit relocated to the PSL Building, and was joined a couple years later by various units of Information and Educational Technology.

If this isnt what you expected, you might be looking for the Physical Sciences and Engineering Library.

Also referred to as the Hitler Tower, it is a hotspot for Airsoft because of its symmetry and multiple levels, as well as hills and bushes which provide Vietnamstyle airsoft play. The tower in the middle makes for a great base, as does the garden around the back. When playing airsoft here, be aware of the houses around the place, where people can see you, and the patrol cars which stop by every once and a while.

The best place in davis for a fortress style airsoft match also has a easy roof to climb up for sniping.


Yeah, kind of a scary building.  It looks kinda like a fortress with the large block of concrete in the middle by the entrance.  It seems as though it was meant to be defended.  I can just imagine trying to walk up the steps and having arrows shot at me from directly above or having burning tar poured from above.  yeah... Users/GeorgeLewis

I went there when I was first hired by IET. It was harrowing. In addition to riding to the ass other end of town, I was then asulted by this building which is just as intimidating inside as it is out.  Users/ArlenAbraham

I worked here too. My coworkers and I were sick all the time. When we moved yet again to another building, we stopped getting sick. Coincidence? Actually, I kind of liked the building, disregarding the getting sick part.  Users/JessicaLuedtke

Most people who work in this building are exceptionally friendly people.  Users/MichaelGiardina
