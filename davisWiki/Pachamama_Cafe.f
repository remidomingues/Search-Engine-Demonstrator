Pachamama Coffee Cooperative opened the Pachamama Cafe inside the Davis Food Coop on G St.  It serves coffee grown by Pachamama coop farmers and roasted in Sebastopol by Pachamama.

They sell selfserve drip coffee, Custom Drip Brew, espresso drinks, cold brewed coffee, and an array of iced and hot tea.

They use 100% organic ingredients, and as many as possible come from companies that give back to the farmers (keeping with the spirit of Pachamama).


The Cafe opened in August 2008 and is still developing the small space it leases from the Food Coop, but it looks nice now and serves very high quality coffee and tea that can be enjoyed while shopping or sitting outside at the Coops shaded patio where WiFi Hotspots WiFi is available.

They also have a stand at the Saturday Farmers Market where you can order most of their drinks except espresso drinks.  Cans of coffee beans cost $10 a pound, or bring your empty Pachamama cans to be refilled for only $6 per pound.

20080922 10:11:01 nbsp Drip bar was looking pretty proper last time I was peeping scene at the coop, but I no nothing about coffee so I look forward to hearing what you have to say! Users/StevenDaubert

20080922 18:41:47 nbsp This is my new favorite for coffee locally.  The custom drip is fantastic.  Only small complaint is that once its all in the cup, its not as hot as it should be.  I think it might be that if they arent serving a lot of customers when you go in, the ceramic filters are cold and absorb a lot of the heat form the water.   Or maybe its the distance the stream of coffee falls through the air cools it off a bit.  Seems like if you heat the filter and set the cup right under the filter it wouldnt cool as much.

20080923 14:06:05 nbsp I work at Pachamama.  CoffeeSnob, you should let me know its you when you come in so we can talk coffee and you can give me some suggestions for improvement (like what MatthewPearson did here. thank you MatthewPearson, I had been wondering how to keep the drip hotter and I hadnt thought of heating the ceramic.  Ill definitely look into the best way to do that.)  I would really like to serve the best drinks orderable in town, so any help is appreciated. Users/KernHaug

20081023 11:06:25 nbsp Hey Kern, what do you look like? Ill look for you when I visit.

Sorry I havent updated my impressions. Until Ive thoroughly sampled the coffee in secret shopper fashion at least as much as I have with the other cafes in town, I wont be giving my opinion. Since the CoOp is so far from my house, I have to go out of my way to visit.

Initial impressions:
 Barista seemed actually interested in making the espresso.
 Milk was steamed better than any other cafe in Davis, not quite microfoamy though.
 Proportions on the cappuccino were off, more like a latte.
 Espresso did not come through the milk, may be because of proportions or may be because of the espresso. Espresso was not on the menu (this was before they had the bigger menu). Users/CoffeeSnobDavis

20081025 23:20:50 nbsp Im currently the only male employee.  And my headband (as required by the deli) is a tie.  And man, yeah, steaming/foaming milk well while getting good cappuccino proportions is tough.  I had it down pretty well on my home machine, but definitely have to practice at work (which is tough because not many cappuccinos are ordered).  Thanks for the feedback. Users/KernHaug

20090125 00:27:21 nbsp I havent had many chances to get a drink from your hands, Kern, but I have had many from your coworkers. Im afraid the overall verdict is not good :(

How do you guys get trained? Any required reading, like Professional Baristas Handbook by Scott Rao or Espresso Coffee: Professional Techniques by David Schomer? Road trips to Temple Cafe or Old Soul Co in Sacramento? I saw your suggestion box and it looks like you guys are making an effort to improve.

^Here are my suggestions, Im too lazy to write it on paper. Users/CoffeeSnobDavis

20090606 13:43:39 nbsp Holy shcamoly their iced coffee is like liquid crack. Not only does it taste amazing, but itll make you bounce off the walls for hours. Users/TJJ
