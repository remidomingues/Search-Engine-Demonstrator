Pachamama Coffee Cooperative Davis is a drip coffee bar inside the John Natsoulas Gallery. When you buy coffee from Pachamama, you are buying it directly from the farmers who own the company. The board of directors are comprised of members from the five cooperatives. 100% of the profits from the coffee go to the five producer cooperatives that own the company. Over 100,000 small scale, organic coffee farmers own the company. The downtown location serves organic and direct trade coffee as well as fair trade and organic tea.

I also appreciate the politeness of their staff. It seems that they are all passionate about coffee, and they wont give you a sideways glance if you ask for your coffee iced (which Ive expressed at some upperscale coffee shops). It is a little on the expensive side but well worth it! Users/lunelectronique
