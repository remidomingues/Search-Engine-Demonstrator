Pacific Auction Company is a locallyfounded charity fund raising operation. They offer services in live and silent auctions, both locally and across the country. Pacific Auction prides itself on being a fullservice business, and will manage the preparation, set up and execution of auctions. That way you are free to focus on your major donors, sponsorship solicitations, or other aspects of the event. However, if the fullservice option is not needed, they can also provide consigned auction items to help raise more money and enhance the look of your auction. They are committed to working with you to find the best fit for your particular event.

So, if you have a nonprofit which wishes to raise money through an auction, contact them. Local clients include Explorit Science Center and the US Bicycling Hall of Fame, among others.

The Looking Glass, a picture framing shop, is located within their space.
