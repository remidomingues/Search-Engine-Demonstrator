 PACIFICO COOPERATIVE COMMUNITY 


Pacifico Cooperative Community is a students studentbased Cooperative Housing housing coop, located at the end of Drew Circle, on Unitrans W & M bus line, as well being nestled right up against the South Davis Bike Path &  Putah Creek Greenbelt Putah Creek Parkway. The purpose of Pacifico is to provide cooperative, lowcost studentbased housing (some nonstudents live here too) for those attending UCDavis and other schools in Davis and Sacramento communities. Nonstudents may also apply. Pacifico strives to engage in safe, cooperative, living that further the principles of cooperation through mutual, selfhelp living at a minimal cost. To this end, each resident will contribute 4 hours in workshifts per week (cleaning, cooking, gardening, shopping for supplies, etc.), and there are opportunities for leadership and involvement through our two coordinator positions and community engagement opportunities.

Pacifico is also often looking for applicants for their two compensated Coordinator positions, who will also be members of the coop. These positions will be given a rent stipend of $250 and full workshift credit for their positions.  The coordinators will, respectively, be responsible for Maintenance and Membership services.  The coordinators will work with the fulltime staff and the membership at large to make sure that the services offered by Pacifico are high quality and affordable.  More information can be obtained by contacting Johnathen Duran at jduran@ych.ca.gov.

There are two separate buildings: C, and D buildings (respectively). A and B buildings are currently closed. Ones experience can vary greatly there depending on which building/floor youre in, due to the different housemates, and the different arrangements that may have been made or groundrules in each area (ie, some have authorized companion animals, some are quieter than others, some are student only, some mixed, etc). Depending on whether you want a place to live quietly by yourself or you want a place to socialize with others will determine how you feel about living here. Like most cooperative living, the members are usually friendly to outsiders too. A deposit is needed to secure a room for future occupancy.

Each of Pacificos two buildings are comprised of twenty small singleoccupancy rooms, four larger singleoccupancy rooms, two small doubleoccupancy rooms, and two larger double occupancy rooms, and one of the buildings has a studio apartment for the manager who lives on site. Additionally, each building has a fully equipped community kitchen, large dining area, furnished community living room and laundry facilities. Each room includes computer DSL Internet access as well as phone and cable hookups. Visually, it seems more like a dorm (shared bathrooms, communal lounge space, communal dining area, communal kitchen) than Agrarian Effort (etc) on campus, which are structured as houses. Pacifico is home to a diverse mix of students and singles from within the local area, the U.S. and abroad. Because of the low cost, available benefits, and convenience of familystyle living, Pacifico is a time and moneysaving choice for many international, transfer, and reentry students  or for any graduate students graduate or undergraduate students who want to give coop living a try.

Beginning July 1, 2011, Pacifico officially became affiliated with Yolo County Housing, who bring management support and assistance with cooperative education and community organizing. The previous management company will no longer be employed. In the process, the members of Pacifico have had the opportunity to become more involved in the daytoday decisionmaking and there is a growing core of coopers willing to contribute their time into improving their coop community and housing enjoyment level.

 History 
Davis Campus Cooperatives (DCC) operated two (later four) student housing coops on Parkway Circle in the late 1980s and early 1990s, known as the concrete coops. Cooperators and bloggers Sarah Brady and Alfred Twu http://itsacoop.blogspot.com/2011/06/pacificoifyoubuilditwhowillcome.html  wrote in 2011:
 This grand project grew from a meeting between Davis Campus Cooperatives and the Japanese Consumer Cooperatives in 1988.  DCC was a young coop consisting of two small houses that had just opened that year.  From the meeting, DCC received a commitment from the JCC to loan $400,000, which it used to gain support and additional loan pledges from the City of Davis and other NASCO student coops towards the opening of more coops.

 In 1998, an opportunity came up when a new market rate apartment development needed to fulfill its citymandated inclusionary housing requirement.  The projectâ€™s birth as an inclusionary housing project necessitated new construction and also determined the size and location of the project.  The developer provided the land, and the http://nasco.coop North American Students of Cooperation (NASCO), other coop, and City of Davis loans were used to leverage traditional financing from local bank First Northern Bank which covered the remaining 60% of the cost.

 Initially, three identical buildings were constructed to house 84 students.  To maximize efficiency, Pacifico used a doubleloaded corridor plan with minimal common areas.  Small common areas were provided on the upper floors, with the main kitchens on the first floor.  A large community building was to be put off until later.  To honor its funders and Coop values, the buildings were named Kyoto, Unity, and Rochdale, though in practice the address letters A, B, and C were more commonly used. 

The first three buildings opened in 2000, with the fourth added four years later. The project has always been a studentoriented housing coop, but many have criticized the initial design. Those who know about the idea of a community building with a kitchen have asserted that building it in 2004, instead of D, might have saved the project.

Pacifico was operated as somewhat of a hybrid between a cooperative and an offcampus dorm: the general architecture http://itsacoop.blogspot.com/2011/06/pacificoifyoubuilditwhowillcome.html isnt very conducive to communal living, although it does allow residents more privacy than the On Campus Coops. Rather than being fully or partiallyselfmanaged, like the On Campus Coops, DCC selected MBS Property Management, a professional management company located in West Sacramento. Due to inconsistent marketing and lack of education  problems which began under initial management  Pacifico members havent always identified themselves as a cooperative or even realize that its a coop when they move in. As a result, some residents are apathetic to the concept of cooperative living and look at Pacifico as just a cheap place to live. This lead to http://www.theaggie.org/tag/pacifico/ many problems with vacancies and management, which were not completely solved by subsequent changes.

Over time, however, each house has developed a different atmosphere and chemistry between housemates; and many residents have chosen to live at Pacifico for years and worked hard to improve their house. As one member put it: Pacifico is a place for personal improvement and interpersonal communication, not meant to be only a cheap place to live!!!!!

MBS Management and other factors lead to dissatisfaction from tenants and (presumably) disappointing revenues for DCC. As NASCO was both part of the initial financing, and had experience with offcampus student cooperative housing, they were consulted, starting in 2003. DCC sought partnership with NASCO in 2005, and they agreed to take over management beginning September 1, 2006. As noted above, this lasted until July 1, 2011.

There is a Pacifico Student Cooperative Housing/Comment Archive Comment Archive pertaining to previous eras of management.


20140423 12:32:23 nbsp Pacifico has changed much over the years. Looking over the history of articles and comments about Pacifico, its easy to think this place isnt for you or isnt a great place to live. That has changed.

With Yolo County Housing operating as management (with an incredible, proven track record of management)Pacifico is extremely well maintained, with low levels of cooperation that make for an excellent entry experience to cooperative living. Unlike some of our counterparts in town, we dont limit participation to students which means you get a local American student experience, an international student experience, and an older, wisened, American experience...points of view and interactions that many of us find valuable.

Were a great place for short term residents (were the only place in town that does 3, 6, 9, and 12 month leases), and what we lack in rigid cooperative expectation we make up for in spontaneous cooperative activity, individuality, and wonderous/strange encounters.

Give Pacifico a try. You wont regret it.
