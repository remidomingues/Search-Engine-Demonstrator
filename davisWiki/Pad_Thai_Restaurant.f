20070414 12:04:07 nbsp Pad Thai is the best Thai food in the Sacramento/Yolo region that we have found...and we have tried quite a few. It is a hole in the wall but the food is unbeatable and the service is friendly. I highly recommend it to those who love traditional Thai food. I rate this place a little higher than Thai Spice on Braodway in Sacramento for those who want a comparison. Users/rpatte

20070525 22:46:47 nbsp Id say that this place is around the same level as the places in Davis (which means it is quite good).  Funny that the place is named pad thai considering that was the worst dish we ordered (well below 2k, recipe, or Nakorn).  However, they have the best Massaman curry i have ever had, light with all white meat chicken and a subtle lemmon grass flavor.  Just excellent. Users/MattHh

20070726 14:47:49 nbsp I went in yesterday to pick up some food to take home. After I ordered and paid, I asked how long it would take. The lady told me that their cook wasnt at the restaurant, so Id have to wait for her to drive there and then wait some more for her to cook our order! I told her I didnt have time to wait that long and asked for a refund. She disappeared into the kitchen, making several phone calls. After another 5 minutes of waiting, I insisted on getting my money back. She got angry and said something like You cant expect the food to be ready in 10 minutes! I responded with the fact that she couldnt run a restaurant with an on call cook without informing customers of this before they ordered. She disappeared into the kitchen again and the young man behind the register told us he didnt know how to refund money on ATM. I ended up getting my money back in cash.

Ill be driving to Davis for Thai from now on.  Users/Aggie03

20080613 11:24:44 nbsp After having ordered food from Pad Thai over at least 30 times now I think it is my favorite Thai restaurant in Woodland or Davis.  The service is usually execellent, but they do sometimes have their quirks.  Highly recommended any of the curries. One of the veggie dishes with the chowfun noodles are really tasty.  You can also phone in orders for pick up which can be pretty handy.  Grabbing a red curry and making rice at home is a good way to feed 23 people cheaply. Users/ZachariahJohnson
