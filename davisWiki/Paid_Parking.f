 Frequently Asked Questions About Paid Parking 

Q:	Why were parking meters installed in the E Street Plaza Parking Lot?
A:	Downtown Davis has changed quite a bit over the past few years, with its eclectic mix of restaurants, shops, offices, and residences.  In the face of increasing demand for the most soughtafter parking spaces in downtown, the City of Davis and the Davis Downtown Business Association (DDBA) are introducing paid parking this Fall in the E Street Plaza Parking Lot.  The E Street Plaza Parking Lot, located in the heart of downtown, provides a convenient alternative to circling the block over and over for onstreet parking or having to park further away than you want to.  The longterm parking will enable customers and visitors to spend more time downtown without having to move their vehicle.  The two multispace parking meters are scheduled to be installed and operational in early September.

Q:	How much is the parking?
A:	$1.00 per hour (or, $0.25 every 15 minutes).  Payment will be required between 	        8:00 am6:00 pm Mondays through Saturdays, except Holidays.

Q:	How long can I park?
A:	The parking meters will allow you to pay for up to 4 hours of parking at one time.

Q:	Do I have to pay for a whole hour even if Im just making a quick visit?
A:	No.  You can purchase time in 15minute increments at a rate of $0.25 for each 15minute increment.

Q:	If I decide to stay longer can I add time to the parking meter?
A:	Yes.  The parking meters allow you to add more time without walking all the way back to your car.  Just walk to the nearest meter, select the “add time” option, and enter the transaction code that is printed on your receipt.  When your transaction is completed, you’ll receive a new receipt with your new expiration time.

Q:	What payment options do the parking meters accept?
A:	The parking meters will accept credit cards, bills, and all coins (except pennies).  If you pay with large bills, keep in mind that the meter does not provide change (or refunds for unused time).

Q:	Why are there only two parking meters?
A:	The two parking meters, or paystations, are “multispace” meters that allow you to pay for any one of the 58 numbered parking spaces in the E Street Plaza Parking Lot.  These new meters reduce visual clutter (versus installing “singlespace” meters for every space in the lot), accept a variety of payment options (credit cards, bills, coins), and allow people to add more time without walking all the way back to their car, among other benefits.

Q:	How do the new parking meters work?
A:	After parking their vehicle, users should note their parking space number (which is painted on the ground) and proceed to either of the two paystations, where they will be prompted to:
1.)  enter their parking space number,
2.)  indicate the amount of time to purchase (up to 4 hours),
3.)  insert their payment (credit cards, bills, and coins), and
4.)  retrieve their receipt indicating the expiration time.

Q:	Do I have to return to my car and place the receipt on my dash?
A:	No.  The receipt is for your convenience and verification of payment.  It shows your expiration time, so you’ll know when your parking meter time expires.

Q:	Will disabled placard holders, electric vehicles and motorcycles have to pay to park in the lot?
A:	Vehicles displaying a valid disabled persons parking placard or license plate are allowed to park in any one of the three designated disabled parking spaces in the lot free of charge.  Electric vehicles (ZEV and NEV only) and motorcycles are also allowed to park in the designated “EV” and “motorcycle” parking spaces free of charge.  Any vehicle parking in one of the remaining 58 numbered parking spaces must pay to park in the lot.

Q:	Where will the parking meter proceeds go?
A:	Net revenue from paid parking in this lot will be set aside into an account to explicitly fund enhancements to the parking lot (landscaping, lighting, signage, etc.) as well as other projects that will improve parking convenience within the downtown.

Q:	How do you enforce the new parking meters?
A:	Parking enforcement officers will print a report at the meter that shows which parking spaces have been paid for and which ones have not.  Vehicles parked in an unpaid or expired, numbered space will be cited.
