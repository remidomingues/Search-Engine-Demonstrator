20140812 20:50:12 nbsp My son went to this preschool last year, and we loved it.  Anne is so kind and caring with each of her students.  She gets down on the floor and plays with them and encourages them to follow their interests.   She does a variety of activities each day, one of which is playing with musical instruments.  I loved coming back to pick my son up and see him smiling as her played the drum to an African folk song or Mozart.  The 2 outdoor play areas are also great with a fenced front yard that has water tables, sidewalk chalk and places to paint.  Then the backyard is filled with beautiful flowers, chickens, swing set and other places to explore.  We couldnt be happier and will be signing our child up again this year. Users/Angiebp

20140819 21:09:56 nbsp I feel fortunate to have found this lovely little preschool.  My son loved the 2 years he spent there.  He thrived in the comfortable, homelike environment the school provided.  Teacher Anne is so knowledgeable and able to help kids learn all the important preschool skills with a gentle, patient teaching style.   I was continually impressed with all of the art projects my son brought home.  They were creative and fun and my son enjoyed making them.  I am excited for my other kids to experience this school.           Users/CamilleStephenson
