About the Club

Paintball club is open to everyone whether you are a beginner or an experienced player. Dont feel shy about coming out to play!
We play once a month regularly at Davis Paintball Center. Occasionally we may venture out to other fields such as Capital Edge in Sacramento or Midway in Vacaville.

In addition to paintballing, members can participate in other social club activities such as trips to the local pistol/rifle ranges, games of laser tag, or some nerf games with the Nerf Club.

Playing Schedule

RecBall occurs once or twice a month on a Saturday. Come to our meetings to find out when. We try to accommodate all our members.
