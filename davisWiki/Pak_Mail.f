20070402 15:41:43 nbsp I went here the other day with a very light manilla envelope. I wanted insurance, and they asked if it had a monetary value. I said no (it was irreplacable though so I didnt want it lost.)  They said they could do signature required. The cost came out to be about $15. GreenThing

20070524 00:02:11 nbsp yes pakmail is far pricier than the post office or the UPS store.  However, the tradeoff is better customer service and no $5 charge to tape a box.   Users/wesleywang

20070602 20:10:41 nbsp We have experienced great service and reasonable prices. Yep you could save few bucks at the post office but there is always a HUGE line. In fact the poeple are still in line there now waiting for hell to freeze over. Well go back to Pak Mail very often. Users/Hailey

20070629 16:29:14 nbsp Pakmail Davis is a wonderful store. They are always so helpful. There prices tend to be on par with everyone else, but you get professional packing and the best customer service around. Its definetley worth your time to check them out. I ship all my bikes through them. Tell them APEXBIKES sent you. Users/ApexBikes

20070725 17:09:09 nbsp We use Pak Mail at work to send out packages FedEx and US Mail, and I have had only good experiences. Now I will not go to the Post Office ever again! They are extremely helpful and friendly, and will get you in and out quickly. Users/EricWecker

20071113 12:55:24 nbsp Highly recommend Pak Mail. They are always nice, fast and professional.  Users/MyaBrn

20080118 16:27:17 nbsp We love this place.  They always give us all of our shipping options, and have a great attitude. Users/DavisMan56

20080212 01:30:56 nbsp Been very happy with the service here.  I was surprised that the owner/manager recognized me and remembered my box number, weeks after I had signedup (and had shaved my beard!).  Theyll sign for your UPS packages, which was another big selling point for me (have you ever had to play a game of Attempted Delivery tag with a UPS driver?). Users/DukeMcAdow

20080225 18:48:27 nbsp Ive only ever been here to drop off prepaid DHL packages, but the customer service has been good both times. Tonight, they were open well past the usual closing time (I brought in a package at 6:30pm)! Users/Ami

20080226 21:06:45 nbsp Ive been using Pak Mail since I discovered them a couple of years ago. Scott, the owner/manager, is SUCH a nice man and a pleasure to do business with. I recently had an insured package dispute with USPS, regarding a highvalue package that I had sent to an APO address. It was a complicated issue, but since I sent the package through Pak Mail, Scott did all the following up and tracking with the post office. What incredible service, and such a relief that I didnt have to sit on hold on the USPS automated phone system for three days of my life. Cant say enough good things about this business. Users/ABlack

20080517 23:27:52 nbsp One thing that Pak Mail does very well is custom shipping cartons.  I recently had an oddshaped item I needed to ship, and it didnt fit well in any of the usual boxes.  Scott said he could make up a box for me, so I gave him the dimensions and he had it done a couple hours later.  It cost me a couple bucks more than a generic box but it fit perfectly and was done much better than I could have if I tried to make a box on my own. Users/MattMasuda

20080527 14:12:56 nbsp Had a good experience getting a document notarized today for $10. Users/JohnLin

20090722 17:39:58 nbsp I paid for an item to be shipped at Pak mail, then the next day it came back in the mail with no postage. I was worried because this same thing happened to me at the Post office on 5th and Pole Line about a year ago and it was a huge hassle. I went in to Pak Mail and they took my package and shipped it with no questions asked! I was so releived, because when it happened at the Post Office Id ended up paying again! :(

Pak Mail is better than the Post Office every single time, there is never a line, their supplies are always fully stocked, and they remember their clients. :)  Users/DaniLC

20090804 10:41:58 nbsp REALLY nice guy, and really helpful, too.  I had to ship a dead XBOX, and he helped out a lot.  Great place, and I plan to head back again. Users/apbare
