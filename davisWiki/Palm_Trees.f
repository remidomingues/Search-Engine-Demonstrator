Palm trees are one of the many trees that grow well in Davis.   Popular types include the European originating Mediterranean Fan Palm, the somewhat more local California Fan Palm from Southern California and the Mexican Fan Palm.  They can be found in the Arboretum Arboretums desert collection.

A notable pair of trees are located in front of InNOut Burger.  They form the middle X of the Big W configuration from wiki:wikipedia:Its a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.  The entire store is heavily decorated in palm trees.

Another business surrounded by palm trees is Anderson Farms Co..  When driving on Mace Boulevard near where it crosses over Interstate 80, the tall palm trees are very noticeable.

If you see a tiny bush palm tree, it is likely a Cycads cycad like the sago palm.

Local things named (or apparently named) after the tree include Three Palms Nursery, Best Western Palm Court Hotel and the nearby Palms Playhouse.
