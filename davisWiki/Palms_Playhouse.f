Palms Playhouse (or just The Palms) is a concert venue that primarily hosts folk/bluegrass/Americana performances. Past performers include the Mad Cow String Band, Mumbo Gumbo, Janis Ian, Tom Rush, Dar Williams, the Waifs, and the Nields. KVMR occasionally broadcasts live shows from The Palms on their On the Road Live program.

Once located in an old barn off of Cowell and Drummond in Davis, it moved to the Winters Opera House in late 2002 to make room for new housing developments. Other locations in Davis were considered, such as the Varsity Theatre and Historic City Hall, but renovation costs were too prohibitive. Despite the lack of heating and cooling, the rickety folding chairs, and general lack of space, musicians and their fans returned to the old Palms again and again for over 27 years. Activist songwriter Utah Phillips performed at the final concert on August 24, though the real star that night was manager Dave Fleming as he took the stage one last time to say farewell to the old shack.

The new Palms seats about 220 people and is fully heated and airconditioned. Located in downtown Winters, shopping and dining are just steps away from the venue. Dave still mans the ticket box at the entrance and announces the nights performers. Tickets are available at Armadillo Music with a $2 service charge and at the door (only if show isnt sold out in advance) with no service charge. Other ticket outlets outside of Davis are listed on the website.

The following refreshments are available:
  Bottled water, snacks, soda, coffee, tea  $1.50
  Beer  $3+
  Wine  $5+

Shows are technically 21andover due to the bar. The Palms has been working diligently to become allages again ever since it moved to Winters. That said, the age restriction is apparently never enforced.

The closing of The Palms was featured on an episode of http://www.californiaheartland.org/archive/hl_718/index.htm California Heartland on PBS and was the http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/Content?oidoid%3A12911 cover story in the August 22, 2004 issue of Sacramento News & ReviewFootnote(Giles, Mindy. http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/Content?oidoid%3A12911 Splendor in the grass.

2013032021 1:53:09 nbsp Palms cancels Michelle Shockeds April 24 concert. Censorship based on third party news stories about her antigay rant (or riff)? Did the Palms staff talk to anyone who was at Shockeds Yoshis Sunday night concert? Or, perhaps, was the Palmss staff there? Open minds want to know. Or do Palmss staff just take what they read on the Internet at face value? Users/ZootSuit

20130321 13:20:35 nbsp Re Michelle Shocked: perhaps The Palms didnt want to take a chance on selling tickets to a potentially unpleasant experience? Users/KeithRancor

     Palms audiences could be Shocked, even. And bourgeois Winters cant afford that. Users/BrianKenyon

      Short, Sharp, Shocked, one of her albums; shes been a hillbilly stirrerupper at least since the 84 Demo Convention in SF, street protesting corporate contributions to both Demos and Republicans. Users/ZootSuit

If you want to hear an audio of the Yoshis concert, go http://littleaustralia.blogspot.com.au/2013/03/michelleshockedaudioofrantlyingin.html here.  Given this and some other statements she made afterward, I think the Palms called this one right for now. Users/HiramJackson
