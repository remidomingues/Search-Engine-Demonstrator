20100607 13:39:24 nbsp Thanks for your work on the Pet Pals page, Pam!  Theres nothing wrong with soliciting comments, so long as they actually come from discrete users.  Some folks will make extra accounts and leave bogus comments on their businesses pages, which really skews things.  Thanks for clearing it up!  Ill work a little bit on the content of the main page when I have a chance, probably this evening, to make it less advertisey.  It doesnt need to be completely emptied out, by any means.  Just a little less promotional.  My advice would be a bulleted list.  Like I said, Ill see what I can do when I have some time.  And, again, thanks for your effort! Users/TomGarberson
 I just went ahead and adjusted the language.  Feel free to adjust the descriptions if youd like.  Just bear in mind the key distinction: it should be informational rather than promotional in nature.  Again, thanks for your effort in working with the wikis guidelines! tg

20100607 14:34:02 nbsp Thank you. I appreciate the info and editing with our Pet Pals Page. Your changes seem just fine to me. Please note, all of the folks who posted for us are indeed real Pet Pals clients.:) Including the negative one.:( I did try to reverse the posts to have the most current ones first. Is that ok? Again, appreciate you help and input. Thanks much, PD Users/PamDanzik

20100607 14:39:29 nbsp Im actually not sure what the general take is on reversing chronological order.  Because new comments appear at the bottom, itd be a lot of work to maintainsince each new comment would need to be moved up.  On pages where there are a lot of comments, its common to move older comments to a comment archive.  In this case, though, I dont think thatd fly.  With only one negative comment, thatd come across as whitewashing or covering up the negative experience someone had.  My advice would be to just let it fly asis.  Almost every business on the wiki has a mix of positive and negative reviews, and readers will recognize that fact.  It sounds like a lot of your customers really like the service, so you shouldnt have much to worry about.

Also, if you havent checked it out yet, theres some good general info for a business owner/representative at the Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner page.  Have a look when you get a chance. Users/TomGarberson
