 Candidate Statement 

Hi Aggies!

I’m Pamela Nonga and I want to be your next ASUCD Senator because I love UC Davis and want to give back to my campus. I am a third year Communication and Political Science double major from San Jose, California. I’m the current President of Davis BlackBook and a member of the Davis College Democrats. I have previously written for the California Aggie as an opinion columnist, served as Secretary of the Black Student Union, and participated in the UC Davis Washington Program.

I am running for ASUCD Senate with the NOW slate because I want to use my skills to improve the college experience of my peers and to unify our student body. I am determined to make education more affordable and to make UC Davis feel like home to every person attending this school. My goals will be achieved through the following platforms:

AGGIES REUSE BOOKS!
Students are paying way too much for textbooks.  As a senator, I will provide an efficient and affordable alternative to purchasing textbooks by expanding Aggie Reuse to include a textbook subdivision. The current options of the bookstore and online vendors are profit driven while Aggie Reuse is student focused and ASUCD run. This will keep money in students’ pockets by directly linking together those looking to buy books and those looking to sell. Finding the textbook you need will be as easy as using your Kerberos login or going into Aggie Reuse. Additionally, I will advocate for more online and open source textbooks, which do not require the costs of printing and manufacturing.


UNITE STUDENT ORGS
I know from firsthand experience that student organizations are a great way to meet new people and find your niche on campus. I want to work to bring organizations together, so that they can put on bigger and better events and to foster campus unity. We have a great variety at UCD, from cultural to social to careerspecific to environmental, but they do not interact with each other enough. Once a quarter, I will bring student organization leaders for a social where they can share their current projects and plan for future collaborations. I will also work with the Center for Student Involvement to centralize information on student org leaders, events, and issues. Finally, I will work to provide funding and publicity for programs and events put on by multiple orgs.

I am so excited to represent and serve the students of UC Davis.

Remember to vote PAMELA NONGA #1 and NOW #26 for ASUCD Senate and SANDSTROM / BOTTOMS for PRESIDENT and VICE PRESIDENT on February 1922 at elections.ucdavis.edu!
