20120417 19:53:53 nbsp I have danced at Pamela Trokanskis Dance Workshop for 10 years. I have studied Jazz, Modern/Contemporary, Improvisation and Earth Rhythms. My daughters danced here from ages 414 and remember classes here as fun, challenging, wonderful for creative expression and learning dance technique. This is a great place!

20130506 10:15:04 nbsp I started dancing at this studio in 2006 and have been there ever since. The first time I called the studio, I heard a message on their answering machine talking about how everyone can dance at any age and I knew this was the place for me as an adult who just wanted to keep dancing. The quality of the training here is far beyond any studio I have taken classes at. The teachers care and make sure students use good technique to keep them safe. I mainly take jazz and modern/contemporary classes, but Ive taken ballet, dance team, break dance, dance team, and hip hop occasionally. There are even opportunities for everyone to perform if they want. Its an amazing place and and excellent community. The dancers are friendly and encouraging. Users/MicheleTobias

20130508 13:53:09 nbsp I started dancing at this studio about a year and a half ago, after trying nearly every studio in Davis and Sacramento. I have to say it is THE BEST dance studio in the entire Davis/Sacramento area! As someone who moved from the bay area not long ago, I would even say that this studio is comparable and even better than some of the best studios in the bay area. Another bonus this studio offers is lots of performance opportunities for people of all ages and skill levels. If you really want to see your dancing improve with high quality dance instruction, no matter where you are as a dancer, then take classes here. Users/SaraDelorena

20130524 13:06:31 nbsp I’ve taken many classes at the Pamela Trokanski Dance Workshop over the years, and the instruction has always been consistently excellent.  Prior to moving to Davis in 1989, I had taken many professionallevel ballet and modern classes in the SF Bay Area and was surprised to find that level of instruction here.  Pamela has the unique ability to structure the classes so that both the aspiring and professional dancer receive the training they need, and if you are dancing just for fun, she shows you the respect of giving you corrections (rather than just focusing on the aspiring and professionallevel students) and providing sufficient challenges to foster growth and progress.  This is the most humane, responsible studio I have ever attended: if you have physical limitations, she shows you alternatives. Another great thing: this really is a “workshop.”  The choreography portion of most classes consists of choreography in process for upcoming concerts, rather than dry exercises.  Users/JanFiore
