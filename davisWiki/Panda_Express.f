Panda Express is fast, cheap Chinese food, and is known for their signature orangeflavored chicken dish. Panda Express is a chain that is most commonly found in Malls mall food courts, where the prices are less than those found in the Davis location. Similar to the Chinese Buffets in town, the food is premade and served cafeteria style to customers. Panda Restaurant Group, Inc. also owns HibachiSan, which used to share their building. One can smell the oil from Panda Express all over The Marketplace parking lot.

This Panda Express is notably more expensive than its analogous mall locations. A twoentree plate costs $6.25 after taxes.  An Panda Express vs. Davis Noodle City experiment was performed to determine just how cheap their food is, and found that a downtown restaurant that makes food to order, Davis Noodle City, was cheaper by the pound and was arguably quicker if you permit calling in an order ahead of time.

Nothing at Panda Express is vegetarian options vegetarian. Even the mixed vegetables are cooked in chicken broth. Dont bother if youre vegetarian.

Upon purchasing food here, go home and take their online survey.  Upon completion of the survey, you will be given a code that you can use to get a free entree on your next twoentree plate purchase.  They also occasionally offer a free entrée to promote a new dish, such the free Kobari Beef on September 29, 2010.

Panda Express sometimes offers coupons for free items. http://www.pandaexpresssocialmedia.com/uplate/coupon.php?sourcewallpost coupon link

There was a Boston Market in this location years ago.

20051030 19:43:27 nbsp I find their Gourmet Chinese Food slogan to be quite humorous; I cant think of anything further from gourmet. However, theyre the only Chinese place in town that provides nutritional information even if their serving sizes are way off when it comes to steamed rice. Users/AnnaJones

20051103 10:26:05 nbsp In terms of quantity, is this place all that much cheaper than other Chinese places? Ive heard their Orange Chicken entree costs $6.59. Do they at least give large portions? Users/CraigBrozinsky

20051215 17:35:06 nbsp While my only experience with Panda Express is at mall locations (where I was rather unimpressed), I think Panda Express is not unique enough to Davis to breath added life into this otherwise cursed location.  I think they should put a cool restaurant like a DINER in there.  How about Mels coming back?  They used to be in the U Mall before it rennovated. Users/JaimeRaba

20071126 15:02:47 nbsp The panhandlers around The Marketplace have invaded this restaurant, and the staff doesnt do anything about it. On Saturday, my husband and I took our 16 month old there for lunch. There were only a few people in the place; as we were sitting down, a scratched and disheveled homeless man approached us. He would not leave and started to make a move towards my son. We blocked the homeless man, but he kept trying to get around us and go for my boy. My husband screamed repeatedly at the man to leave, I grabbed my son, and began calling 911. All this time, the staff actually cowered in the back. Not once did they come out or try to help. A 20something guy sitting nearby came over to guide the homeless man out the door, but the bum attacked the guy! He began hitting him, and still the staff hid. I relayed this to 911. Once the bum realized he was outmatched by the guy, he left quickly  before the cop came of course. On the way out, a staff member cleaning tables mumbled to me (I dont think she spoke much English) something like, Oh, bad thing. If you have to go into this place, keep your cell phone handy, your small children away, and be prepared for aggressive panhandling seemingly condoned by the staff. Users/NoelBruening

  Hmm. i was wondering what had happened to all the panhandlers recently  Users/FredChen

        They started invading Longs. Im not even allowed to throw them out! Users/thelonepiper555

20071203 00:36:37 nbsp Unfortunately, the title is misleading. When I first went there, I had expected them to serve panda, but well, it seemed too good to be true. Anyway, Ive been there many times, and heres what I have to share...

Only seen one panhandler, though that was probably on the same night as the person above me.

This place is expensive. A two plate entree with a drink and Federal Taxes is a little over $7. If you have more time than money, you can go to Safeways to buy a drink and come back to Panda Express. However you might need to sign up for a free Safeway Club Card or else the outrageous nonmember price will hit you. If you go through all that, you just saved yourself 30, maybe even 40 cents.

As for the food itself, well, if you are experienced with Chinese Cuisine, you might find it soso for Chinese food, and a little bit too greasy. If you arent, Panda Express is pretty good, and saucy, right? Most people get a two entree plate. A woman or man behind the counter will then scoop up and plop your choice of a side, and two entrees. As for the sides, theres the steamed white rice, the fried rice, and the chow mein. Personally, I prefer the chow mein. Even though its tasteless, I enjoy the texture of the soft noodles in my mouth, and the savory softness goes well with some of the entrees. The fried rice sucks. The steamed rice, on the other hand, complements the entrees well (as well).

Of the entrees, never get the Black Pepper Chicken. In their haste to crank out as many bulky restocks of the food, the onion slices that are featured in the Black Pepper Chicken entree are not caramelized probably. That means it is still white and somewhat raw, and will require breath mints afterwards, unless you are alone. The other dishes are okay, nothing memorable. Orange Chicken is featured (which is simply Sweet and Sour Chicken, but orange colored) seems to be able to trick others with its promoted hype. But I had it, and its nothing special. I always get Broccoli Beef, because I like Broccoli, and it seems like they cant possibly screw that up. The regular Sweet and Sour Pork is too soggy. The Zucchini Tofu, is interesting. But since it is pretty unpopular, chances are it isnt fresh. (Meaning the cooks dont restock it as often as the other entrees). And since it isnt fresh, its pretty unpopular...

Bottom line, this place is fast food and you knew that before walking in. Users/R

20071203 02:57:54 nbsp six something for a two item with chow mein/fried rice. Kinda pricey for what you get. Place is clean though. Users/KaiWan

20080115 05:28:43 nbsp i always get a 2 entree plate with chow mein, orange chicken, and mandarin chicken

nothing else seems satisfyingly edible or tasty
Users/FredChen

20080128 16:51:34 nbsp I think basically if youre in a hurry, and just want a quick bite to eat that isnt fast food, unless you are a vegetarian or vegan, this isnt the worst place you could go. If all else fails, theres always the adequate appetizers. Users/thelonepiper555

20080918 15:28:43 nbsp @Porkfoo: panda express is the typical chinese fast food, lots of grease and rice You should look at the food your mom makes. Most chinese food is greasy and has rice  not just fast food ones. Users/shalimar

20080930 22:05:55 nbsp Went to panda and got pieces of chicken in my 100% vegetarian bowl. Absolutely disgusting/vomitinducing. How the fuck did it even get in there? Not going again. DO NOT RECOMMEND to any vegetarians who just want a quick bite WITHOUT PIECES OF CHICKEN HIDING AMONG THE EGGPLANT.  Users/triscuitqueen

  Oh my Gosh! There was food in your food? You poor vegetarian! Users/ColinDoyle
  20081002 15:19:46 nbsp To the commenter above, Panda Express explicitly states that nothing they serve is vegetarian. Even the steamed veggies are cooked in chicken broth. They have this on a sign in the store and on the website; this info is also on this page. Thus, it was only assumed to be vegetarian, and as such, you cant really fault them for it. Panda is not for vegetarians. But, there food is still good if you are really craving greasy orange chicken :) Users/ascapoccia
  It reminds me of my veggie burgers that I make with barley, onions, carrots... and stew beef.  My vegetarian roommate asked to try some and I pointed out that vegetable does not mean vegetarian.  An assumption of cooked vegetables being vegetarian  especially in a fast food restaurant  is a bad move.  Note the third paragraph at the top of this entry. Users/JabberWokky

20081002 23:11:11 nbsp the orange chicken is delicious and the chow mein is tasty Users/ellenislove

20090119 22:10:21 nbsp The manager was very rude here.  It is not posted that you cannot bring dogs in, and seeing as we walk there with our dogs, we typically bring them in with us.  Tonight she yelled at us, when she could have calmly asked us not to bring them in.  We will think twice before coming here again. Users/jadeeyes1113

20090320 13:27:32 nbsp My housemates eat this stuff.  Doesnt look too good.  To the above poster: It is a health code violation to bring animals into restaurants.  It was unfortunate that you were yelled at however. Users/BenLee

20090404 22:35:45 nbsp This place is pretty much what youd expect, foodwise, and so I wouldnt even bother to comment except to mention how poorly run it is.  The times that I have gone, there is always a huge line just waiting to get your plate with rice or whatever, with nothing much going on in the center area or at the cash register.  If anyone related to management is reading this: weve known about the assembly line method since the early 1900s.  It works.  I recommend it.  The first person should be doing rice/chow mein, then pass to the next person, then pass to the next person, then to cashier.  If one person tries to do many different things, the line doesnt flow.  Second bit of free advice: teach your people to talk to one another.  The cooks finishes a plate of food, but doesnt tell the people who are dishing the food.  Or, someone dishes up a plate of food, but doesnt tell anyone that it is ready.  No one expects amazing food here (at least I dont), but I do expect fast food, since its already made!

To the person with the dog above: they have outdoor tables.  Thats where our dogs hang out while we sit next to them and eat our food... as someone else pointed out, you cant bring dogs into restaurants.  Personally, I think its a stupid law, but thats the law. Users/CovertProfessor

20090507 12:17:57 nbsp While it may not be fair to generalize a chain based on a couple of bad experiences, I have had several with Panda Expresses in other places.  The food has been decent, but nothing special.  However 2 out of 3 times Ive gone there I have been ill.  One time was in a Mall, and you cant expect much from a mall food court, but the other time wasnt.  Now Im not saying anything about this particular one, but after that I wont eat Panda Express.

20100723 15:50:50 nbsp Its an AmericanChinese fastfood joint, what kind of food do you expect? Its not terrible food, but you could do better. If you are craving something Chinesey and this is your best option it isnt the worst choice. Those who say its the worst food in Davis are clearly exaggerating because there are worse eateries; indeed, simply peruse this wiki and youll easily find a handful of questionable restaurants.  Users/blastoff

20100727 22:25:58 nbsp If you think Taco Bell is Mexican food, youll probably like Panda Express. Users/JimStewart

  I dont claim that Taco Bell serves Mexican food, but I do find their items pretty tasty. Panda Express chow mein, while it may not be up to par for all the Authentic foodnazis out there, tastes pretty decent. Pretty damn good for 3 dollars though, and its a huge portion. Users/TheShah
   The thing is that Davis has so many fine Chinese and Mexican restaurants, that can serve you authentic or popularized Chinese or Mexican food, it seems sad to eat at a place that puts quantity, speed and profit before quality.  The cost and portion size becomes less and less a factor with age. users/jimstewart
    Oh, I agree with you wholeheartedly. But as a college student, I wish I could afford to eat quality food more often. (Especially Thai food, mmmmm...) And I mean afford in terms of both price and time. Users/TheShah

Update: the Kobari Beef is pretty tasty.  Slightly spicy, with a good kick from the leeks.  Id say its better than most of the entrees there, although Im generally not a huge fan of Panda, so feel free to take my opinion with a grain of MSG.  Dont expect a full meal out of the freebie; it comes in a tiny little togo box.Users/TomGarberson

20110209 18:40:17 nbsp I love panda their sides are kinda meh, but beijing beef and sweetfire chicken are always awesome, along with the creamcheese wantons. Obviously not real chinese food, but still damn tasty, in my opinion. Then again, I did basically grow up on fast food my whole life. Users/AndrewJacobs

20110310 18:34:05 nbsp Got obviously overcharged, and got three different opposing explanations before they finally agreed to give my money back. And of course, they wanted to just give me extra food, trying to push that option three times before finally agreeing to give my $2.25 back. Have some integrity please, and learn to apologize when youre wrong instead of being incredibly rude; you just lost out on a previous longtime customer.  Users/ScottMeehleib

20110421 18:59:03 nbsp I dont care how much my Asian friends hate this place and how much crap they give me for going there, Panda Express is still my favorite Chinese food place. Period. And I will love it forever, especially the orange chicken. Users/ElizabethWood

20110622 15:35:14 nbsp THE MOST RUDEST people Ive ever met, they seem like they are forced to be nice but arent really respective of you. I was about to pay at the front register and was deciding if I wanted anything else, and the Mexican girl at the front yelled at me to pay and I said Give me one minute and she yelled to speak up, thats right YELLED not asked nicely. If I werent hungry that afternoon, I wouldve straight up yelled back at her and left without the food.

Also, the food was horrible waste of my money. Users/AndersonDaily
  It sounds like she may have been hard of hearing. Also, how does her race enter into it? users/JoePomidor
     Simple identification of the employee the complaint was about?  I do agree that specious accusations of racism or complaints with racist overtones do pop up on the wiki, but this seems more like basic identification (you could equally ask what her gender had to do with it).  People of all colors or genders can be rude, unable to hear, volume unaware, or whatever happened (me, I tend to be as loud as the loudest person in the room, which I have to consciously avoid doing). ⁓Users/JabberWokky ʝ⍵
   If I were working in that kitchen, with the clanging of woks, people yelling back and forth, etc., Id probably be hard of hearing, too, and maybe a bit frustrated with people who were supposed to give their order to the people taking orders.   Users/CovertProfessor
  In reference to stating the employees ethnicity, I do find it troublesome that it was used in the sentence above. Mainly because it means that white is still the default. If it is just for identification purposes, then each time we describe anyone, their ethnicity should be stated, including that of white people.  For example, the above sentence would read ...the white girl at the front yelled at me...

20110709 18:28:03 nbsp I guess I wasnt clear with the amount of anger I had writing this. Ok I agree with the amount of loud noises happening in the kitchen, but I still dont get why she told me to hurry up when I was still looking at the other foods in case I wanted other things to eat. Yeah, she yelled at me but why couldnt she be professional and ask sir are you ready? or not instead of yelling at me to hurry? I dont know, I thought places like these are suppose to act professional but I guess their manager doesnt discipline their employees appropriately. And with the race issue, it was because I was angry and I just had to point that out because most of the Mexicans Ive encountered here in Davis seem to be loud, obnoxious and bossy. Users/AndersonDaily

20110714 07:49:07 nbsp I just started a job at Panda Express. I like it so far, but the registers are incredibly hard to use.... Its interesting to see so many conflicting opinions about the place on here. Regardless of how the food is, (because Im vegetarian), it pays extremely well, and we do a good business.  Users/SiRJenk

20111105 16:45:43 nbsp This is the worst restaurant in Davis! Never go here! Users/emc2

20111114 20:28:22 nbsp I spent a year shredding the gnar in Tokyo so I know Chinese food and let me tell you, Panda Express is the REAL DEAL. ITS THE BEST CHINESE FOOD IN DAVIS and maybe the WORLD!!! I eat here every day if i get the chance. Unfortunately Im in Hong Kong for the rest of the year so I cant get good Chinese food here :( Users/KCSlater

20120514 15:51:13 nbsp Up until recently, Panda Express was part of my weekly rotation of lazy college student cooking and reasonablypriced takeout. Its not because the food is fantastic or that the prices are dirt cheap (though if you make use of the coupon on the back of the receipt, you do get a pretty good deal), but mainly because it was so convenient to walk across the parking lot and get a styrofoam box of warm food in a few minutes.

I dont think anyone should walk into a Panda Express and expect gourmet or remotelyauthentic Chinese food their dishes are tasty in their own way, and their portions are decent. With the exception of one visit out of dozens, Ive found the service to be good. Bear in mind that good at a fast food restaurant is not the same as good at a fine dining establishment, but the folks working the counter are generally quick and responsive, even if I had to repeat myself over the clanging of woks and food pans. Theyre not there to wait on you hand and foot, and some will be visibly impatient at a particularly indecisive customer (I dont blame them, I have a hard time resisting a frown or eyeroll when someone takes 5 minutes to decide on their second entree, too), but overall, Ive always been satisfied with my meal and will continue to go.

Free Orange Chicken.  As it is free, Im not sure I care who cooks it. Users/DavidBarnum

20121116 13:44:49 nbsp I find it laughable that there are so many negative comments here for a place that is cheaper than nearly every other asian restaurant in Davis. I also find it laughable to read comments like who goes here? Want to know who goes here? Everytime I go there is typically a line of between 15 to 20 people....yet we keep seeing comments on sites like this saying who goes here for a place that makes by far the best Orange chicken in the area if not the world.  Users/RandyUCD

20130718 14:18:41 nbsp I really dont know why I keep coming back here. Its not bad if you want cheap fastfood that isnt a burger, but the service at this location is absolutely terrible. Several times now Ive gone and had to wait in line while a single worker helped a single customer in front of me as they waffled back and forth deciding what they wanted for their second entree. Other workers were literally just walking around, doing nothing, with their hands in their pockets while I stood there waiting, getting angry glares from the sternfaced cooks who have obviously been working there way too long. Its FASTFOOD, I shouldnt have to wait 5 minutes for someone to take my order when there is no one waiting in line.

There are also panhandlers galore out front on the nearby lawn. This seems to be where they like to hang out in the Marketplace.  Users/Chronoz
