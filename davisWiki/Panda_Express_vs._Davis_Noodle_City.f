The Panda Express (PE) Franchise is welladvertised for their Orange Chicken and their thriftyness, We tested these assertions by comparing them with Davis Noodle City (DNC), a local restaurant that has Orange Chicken on the menu, but does not consider it one of their specialty dishes. Thus, if DNC comes out on top, that means one of their nonspecialty dishes is better than PEs best dish. Note, this experiment does not test whether DNCs best dish can beat PEs best dish. This experiment was performed on Sunday, November 6th, 2007 at 5 PM, by Users/CraigBrozinsky and 3 others.  It appears to be the first formal example of a Business Showdown on the wiki.  Hopefully others are soon to follow.

 Speed 
Average travel time between PE and midpoint of Anderson & 8th was 5 minutes, and the average travel time between DNC and midpoint of Anderson & 8th 5 minutes. The DNC team called in their order as they left the parking lot of PE, and were given a receipt at time9. When the team entered, the owner told them Wow, youre quick! But so are we, and pointed to a bag on the counter. The PE team received a receipt at time14, five minutes longer than the DNC team. Based on these findings, if the teams started at the midpoint, both teams might have gotten their food at the same time, but it is unknown when DNC completed the order. Bottom line: Panda Express is no quicker than a local place, and the opposite may in fact be true.

 Quantity

We measured the three PE items (Orange Chicken, Chow Mein, and complementary rice) at 37.5 oz. The Chow Mein and Orange Chicken from DNC items weighed at least 48 oz, but a scale limitation couldnt give an estimate above this amount. DNCs food cost $4.04/lb and PEs cost $4.54. Bottom line: Davis Noodle City wins.

UPDATE: This info is out of date as of March 2011. Orange chicken at DNC is now about $9.00 for dinner and therefore considerably more expensive than Panda Express.

 Quality

Even blindfolded, the participants were able to tell which food came from which restaurant. The tasters agreed that PEs Orange Chicken was much sweeter, and that DNC was much spicier, tasted more like real chicken, and actually had an orange flavor. 1 person preferred PE, 3 people preferred DNC. The Chow Mein from PE had more flavor than that of DNC. However, putting the Orange Chicken sauce over the DNC Chow Mein led 3/4 tasters to prefer it by far. Bottom line: Most preferred DNC, but individual preferences exist.

 Freshness and presentation 
We all agreed DNCs food looked better, and their inclusion of Bok Choy gave them freshness points. PEs noodles looked and tasted like they had been out for a few hours, and DNCs seemed very fresh.

 Summary 
Panda Express does not live up to its reputation of being cheap and quick. A local restaurant, Davis Noodle City was arguably quicker, definitely cheaper, had a better presentation, and 3/4 people found it the tastier Chinese Food Chinese Restaurant.

repeat and see if this the results are duplicated!

Personally I figured DNC would kick some ass in this. Users/StevenDaubert

20080913 22:46:13 nbsp I would rather pay for DNC than get PE for free. Users/Aaron.Curtin
 I dont go to PE, personally I resent them for the food, the hibachisan name (even thought its irrational resentment) and the fact that they replaced the decent but pricey pizza joint, which replaced beloved boston chicken/market.  Users/StevenDaubert

20090308 20:51:45 nbsp My girlfriend and I prefer Panda Express orange chicken. Users/OrofinJackson

20090308 21:40:44 nbsp I feel this is like comparing Taco Bell to El Mariachi Users/EricaMacGregor
  Thats an apt analogy!   Users/CovertProfessor
  Id love to see someone do that! Though, unlike Panda Express, Taco Bell does have items that you wont find at a Taqueria, and is open until 1AM. There are certainly days when Id prefer a Nacho Cheese Chalupa to a Nopales Burrito! Users/CraigBrozinsky

20090329 20:14:23 nbsp Ive never seen a Panda Express with a drive through, their food doesnt use MSG like Taco Bell, and they have panda shaped hedges out front.
Say what you want about which one tastes better, but Panda Express is definitely no Taco Bell.

Davis Noodle City has strange jiggly fat on all of their chicken dishes, while El Mariachi has nothing but delicious lean cuts of meat. The two restaurants can only compare in the number of snobbish comments about authenticity on their wiki articles.

Also, Panda Express has a few thinks I cant get anywhere else in Davis. Their fortune cookies with a touch of vanilla, the only truly spicy chicken dish in Davis, and beijing beef. Users/OrofinJackson

  A quick search of Taco Bells Ingredients on their website indicated to me that there is no Monosodium Glutamate in any Taco Bell item, either. So, in terms of food, Taco Bell and Panda Express may be analagous. Maybe not in terms of exterior garden decor, though... Users/TheShah
  I have seen several drivethrough Panda Expresses, including one as close as Natomas. I would also argue that, if you actually look at the nutrition information, the Panda Express menu is significantly more unhealthy than Taco Bells in general.  Users/ScottMeehleib

20100729 16:51:19 nbsp I like the idea of a VS page comparing all types of local businesses..  anyone else? Users/WesOne
 That could be trouble, what if we did a Droms vs Bizarro world? we could start a Wiki riot.  :)
  I love the idea! We should apply for a research grant from, say, the National Institutes of Health to fund these experiments. Users/TheShah
  Yes!  Im so in. tg

More reasons why Panda Express and Taco Bell are incomparable:

You can see everything the chefs are doing at Panda Express. At Taco Bell, which usually seems to be employed by social degenerates (no offense if youre employed there) you have no idea what theyre doing in those back rooms. My best friend worked at Taco Bell for a year and he refuses to eat fast food now. Hes seen things. But hell eat at Panda still because you can see everything.

Taco Bell consistently gets failing grades for cleanliness in their restaurants. Its consistently in the top 10 worst fast food lists by NBC. Enjoy the cockroach legs and rat feces.

Panda Express serves delicious unseweetened china mist tea. Taco Bell has raspberry Brisk.

Billy Mays signed a contract to advertise for Taco Bell just before his death. Coincidence?


At this point Im just procrastinating from finals studying and I think you probably get that I like Panda Express a lot more than Taco Bell. Users/OrofinJackson

20110307 16:26:28 nbsp Are there any other restaurant comparisons? Users/ThanhVu
  People thought it was a good idea and created a Business Showdown page, but no one really followed through.  You could be the one who inspires everyone to try again!   Users/CovertProfessor
  I was thinking the other day (as I tend to think about totally pointless things) about how interesting it would be to compile a list of every pizza place that delivers in Davis.  Then have a group of people who all initiate a call to one of those locations at the same time to place an order for say a medium, pepperoni pizza to get delivered.  We could create a big chart to compare size, cost of the pizza, delivery fee, speed relative to delivery, speed of order, temperature of delivered pizza, overall quality and so on.  This would of course require lots of hungry folk, lots of cash to spend on a silly project and people who would waste time thinking about something like this...not to mention that true scientific method would dictate we do it at least three times and wed have to decide if we wanted to try this during a slow or busy time of the day.  Im gonna stop now. Users/OliviaY
   Pizza... did someone say pizza?  Mmmm.   Users/CovertProfessor
    There is a wiki get together proposed for May 7th or 8th... Ill bet most would deliver to Slide Hill Park, and if they didnt, that would be data too. jw

20110310 21:25:13 nbsp Being that DNCs chicken is not breaded and quite expensive for Chinese food, Silver Dragon would have probably made for a better comparison against DNC. As it stands, its like comparing apples and oranges. Users/ScottMeehleib
  Yeah, like comparing something reasonably healthy that tastes good, and something that tastes like fried breading with sauce on it.   Users/CovertProfessor
    Haha, yeah. Maybe I should have said like comparing apples and Twinkies. ;)  SM
