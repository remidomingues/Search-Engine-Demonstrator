Panera Bread opened on August 31, 2012, filling half of the location previously home to Blockbuster.

Panera Bread features a vast menu of various items ranging from sandwiches to salads. They also have a wide variety of bakeries bakery items.

You order at the counter and you are given a number to display at your table or a paging device. Your food is delivered to your table, or is given to you when you present the lit and buzzing device.

This Panera location features free 802.11g WiFi.  This is much slower than modern 802.11 WiFi, and is unencrypted.

20120902 16:33:36 nbsp I had their signature turkey artichoke panini.  It cost $9.00 and came with a bag of chips. It was just ok.  I can go to togos. who has very fresh tasty bread and get a half sandwich and salad, or $6.75, and its a meat salad.  Not so impressed with Panera that its going to divert me from other places where i can actually PARK. Users/DavisLurker
  Or, one could go across the street to nonchain Zias Delicatessen and get a yummy Roma sandwich (turkey, provolone, artichoke) for less money... (about $6 iirc).   Users/CovertProfessor

20120903 15:02:31 nbsp I stopped in and tried one of their sandwiches.  The food was good, although very expensive for what you get, and as others have mentioned, Zias is a great alternative.  It is comfortable though, has a nice atmosphere, and slow, free WiFi. Users/IDoNotExist

20120910 14:17:31 nbsp It has over priced processed food. Their soups come from a can. The sandwiches are all bread. Zias is cheaper and way better!  Users/ashleyinthemist

20120910 15:25:01 nbsp I guess its nice that a business is finally filling in the old Blockbuster spot,  but its not exactly a stellar addition to the Davis scene, especially when, as others mentioned, Zias is so close and generally superior. Users/ScottMeehleib

20120917 11:16:49 nbsp I for one am happy that a Panera was added to Davis.  It is one of my favorite places to go for lunch, so I appreciate having it nearby.  I dont go for sandwiches so Im not sure about their quality, but I do very much enjoy their mac and cheese dish.  It is to die for, great taste and portion sizes.  The new chicken stew is also very good, especially in a breadbowl.  Any of their soup is great in a breadbowl really.  The service was pretty quick for such a busy time (there was a line almost out the door), and I enjoy the outdoor seating thats available.  I definitely see myself coming here for lunch from time to time. Users/IndigoShell

20120917 15:51:34 nbsp I for two am pleased with the addition of Panera to our City.  While I totally enjoy Zias and will continue to go there, I also enjoy variety and Paneras sandwiches and salads have always been pleasing.  I have utlized the free wifi while I was there, and while a bit slow, was completely serviceable. Davis has grown a lot in the 22 years I have lived here and while small businesses are fully appreciated and give our City character, having something well known and comfortable is positive as well.  Im happy the space was revitalized so well and Im hoping Panera can provide jobs and tax revenue to the city for years to come.   Users/loneshark

20121007 18:45:52 nbsp Disappointed in Panera. Food quality was very mediocre, and it was very expensive for the food portion and quality. $9 for a sandwich and chips  I can go to Subway and get a bettertasting sandwich and chips for 1/2 that price. :(

20121012 08:16:48 nbsp Sandwiches are tasty, but rather pricey.  Between that and being across the street from Zias, most people (esp. Davis people) are going to support the nonchain restaurant. Users/DavidBarnum

20121022 11:17:00 nbsp Nice atmosphere, way too crowded all the time. Got the creamy tomato soup, as good as I remembered. Workers are all really professional and friendly. internet is a bit slow, but okay for doing work as opposed to browsing. Overall nice place to study, though I wonder if thatll be inconvenient for Davisites just looking to get some food? Users/HannahToru

20121128 08:59:35 nbsp Loved Panera when I went for the first time when I lived in SoCal a couple years ago. Every time I come now, specifically to the Davis location, the food and service seems to get more corporate and fastfoody. Very pricey as well. Ill be taking my business to a nice sit down small business in Davis for the same price from now on. Users/Christinah

20121204 10:51:55 nbsp Seems like most commentors here prefer to support local businesses over a chain like Panera Bread. Which is fine, but just because its a chain brand doesnt mean they wont provide you with an enjoyable lunch. The workers here act professional but theyre certainly not corporate drones they are as human and friendly as the best of Davis natives (pretty sure most of them are working students). I eat here less than once a week, but at least two cashiers have memorized my name and would greet me warmly when I come.

They probably are a bit pricey, but so far my visits have been very pleasant, and I havent felt like Id rather have gone to a different place for lunch. Users/RedPyramid

20121211 14:01:59 nbsp Id never been to a Panera Bread before this one, and I must say Im not very impressed.  Though I love what theyve done with the interior since Blockbuster was there, the food left much to be desired.  I had the Signature (read: more expensive) grilled cheese sandwich sans bacon and a cup of the tomato soup.  The sandwich was disappointing because it was grilled two different ways: on one side of the sandwich, it seemed to have been buttered and grilled on a flattop, but the other side seemed to have been put down on a traditional grate grill.  Maybe this is how they do things, but to me it seemed sloppy and unorganized.  The soup at least was tasty, if a bit on the salty side.  Bottom line, the food seems somewhat overpriced for the money.  If it were tastier and more in line with the prices I can get at other places in town, I would eat here.  For me, its not about the chainstatus of it but rather the quality of the product. Users/Michi

20130213 16:31:31 nbsp I had lunch here this past Sunday.  Very good food, decently priced (a little high compared to some Davis lunch specials, reasonable by any other measures), and friendly service.

They REALLY need to do something about studying students taking up 75% of the tables, though.  There were numerous 4seat tables (I was with a party of four) with a single student, laptop out, studying or Interwebsing away, taking up the whole table.  The only free tables inside were 2seaters (not near each other), so we were forced to move outside.  Not the end of the world, but we were pretty cold by the time we were done eating.  And the same tables were still occupied by the same students  most of whom werent even eating or drinking anything.

Even though I liked the food a lot, I kinda doubt Ill be coming back unless they fix the seating situation. Users/TomGarberson

20130318 13:32:03 nbsp I agree that they need to do something about the studying students.  I have been there for lunch and dinner and it is difficult to find a place to sit. Many of the tables are taken by one student that looks like they have only purchased a drink.  If they could create a section for diners only maybe that would solve some of the problem.
