Davis has its share of panhandlers, people who spend time asking other people for something, usually money.  Some panhandlers may be honest folk living a different lifestyle, others may be having problems in life (mental health or addictions, even severe fiscal hardship due to the topsyturvy economy) that make it difficult to get through life, while others are malicious con artists who approach you with a fabricated story to justify their need.  While some are homeless, not all are. Be wary and use common sense, yes, but also remember to be be kind... you just never know, it could be you given the right set of circumstances.

 Where to Find Them 
  Anderson Plaza  Sitting on the benches outside Albertsons.
  Covell Boulevard Covell offramp on Highway 113 (both northbound and southbound)
  Outside Chipotle in downtown.
  InNOut Burger  At the Olive Drive exit.
  The Marketplace
  Oak Tree Plaza  East end often has a panhandler or two.
  Oakshade Town Center  There is a pretty fearless guy with a bike who will approach you even if youre getting in your car.
  University Mall  At the west exit, there is often a panhandler claiming to be a veteran sitting under the shade of a tree.

Panhandlers are often homeless, but they also include lazy people who just want the money youve worked for. Users/ApolloStumpy

20051121 09:56:16 nbsp I would contend that panhandling is one of the most difficult jobs there is  those that think otherwise should try it sometime when they are feeling lazy and want some easy money. Users/SorryAboutThat

20100530 20:41:30 nbsp Ive encountered a nicely dressed man twice in front of the Orange Court on E Street who has a whole story about being stuck in Davis after his car broke down and he just needs a few more bucks to get a train ticket back to Oakland.  He shows you his ID and seems to be an honest guy, but now that Ive seen him give the same story twice several months apart, Im seriously doubting his story. Users/MicheleTobias

20100602 11:36:52 nbsp You know, its not that all panhandlers are lazy. A lot of them HAVE jobs and STILL dont make enough money for rent (like me), and its really upsetting for me to hear that people consider us lazy. I work 13/hrs/wk and spend 20/hrs/week looking for a second job (without luck, I might add) and the rest of the time I fly a sign that says cant make all rent, anything helps and when people say that Im lazy are out of their minds. I work hard to keep a roof over my head and its upsetting when people think Im going to spend their hard earned money on something stupid (occasionally I will take the money and use it to buy household items such as toilet paper and laundry detergent or dog food, but Im definitely not wasting it on alcohol or cigarettes. But I do know people who fly a sign just to get Brandy, and I get angry and kick them out of their spot. If you ever see me at CVS just say hi and be cordial. Im not a bad person. ;3 Users/Mogitha

20101130 22:01:30 nbsp As much as it seems the panhandlers are just lazy or seeking a fix, I am finding myself to be near the same line Users/Mogitha is on having been laid off of one job earlier this year and now having my hours reduced to one shift at another... It is shameful and it is nothing to be proud of. Hopefully another opportunity will present itself before I need to take this desperate step. Been looking with no luck thus far...  Users/WesP

20120720 13:06:54 nbsp Lately, Ive been seeing seeing a family in the Marketplace shopping center, and at University Mall.  Its the father, mother, and at least 1 small (approximately 4 year old) child.  They appear to be of Indian or Middle Eastern ethnicity, and seem to be genuinely in need... according to their sign, they are just seeking help with basic needs.  Can anyone shed light on who these people are? Users/OldDavis73
