Describe Users/PapaJ here.
Thanks for mentioning the change in management at Papa Johns. Do you think you could give more details on the management history? I know Papa Johns has been great about donating pizza to groups like Amnesty International and schools, so Im curious who is responsible for it. Is it a locally owned franchise? Thanks. People should know how nice you guys are!  Users/NickSchmalenberger
