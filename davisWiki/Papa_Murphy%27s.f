Papa Murphys is a North American chain that sells Take N Bake Pizza Pizza that is handmade and raw. Pizzas can only be sold whole and not by the slice since they are not precooked. The different types of pizza sold are regular pizzas, thin delite pizzas, stuffed pizzas, and calzones. Regular pizzas come in 3 sizes: medium, large, and family. Delite (thin crust) pizzas only come in large. Stuffed pizzas and calzones come in large and family sizes. In addition to pizzas, side items are also sold such as cheesy bread, cinnawheels, salads, and homemade cookie dough.

Employees try to be as helpful and accommodating as possible when taking orders. If youre nice to the cashiers theyll gladly help you figure out all what can and cannot be done when it comes to toppings, etc. Pizzas can be made halfandhalf, in fourths, thirds, and even by slices (which is especially great if a guest is a light eater or have a picky child).

Papa Murphys does not deliver and you cannot dinein. The big white thing in the back is a giant freezer, not an oven, so Papa Murphys cannot bake your pizzas either. If a pizza is purchased under the assumption that it is baked, the employees will happily refund your money when asked.

When ordering by phone make sure to ask about the monthly special(s).
There are often fliers in the mail with discounts and coupons.

20050917 10:10:00 nbsp Yeah... if you go for the thin crust pizza, you can get enough for two meals for 57 bucks, depending on how many toppings you get. Totally awesome. Users/ShaunGeer

20060321 21:53:25 nbsp I got a veggie pizza here once, but it was the worst pizza I ever had. The pizza dough must have been sitting around for a while because the crust was nasty sour. Users/PattyLouieJunior

20090802 15:19:27 nbsp Ad sent to my house stated that they accept American Express. When I went to pick up my pizza they wouldnt accept my Amex. I tried to explain the ad; they just gave me attitude, read the sign on the door, no Amex. Buy your pizza next door at the grocery store. They respect their customers and appreciate the business, regardless of your method of payment. Users/busthead

20090906 21:30:29 nbsp I really like their Chicken Artichoke Delite. Mmmmm marinated artichokes... and bacon! Its really good and not a bad price. Users/KaprilWooley

20091105 21:02:04 nbsp I just came from here and the girl who served me on the phone and in person had to be the most polite and courteous food service employee I have come across in years.  I just had to join the wiki just to say that.  Havent tried the pizza yet but Its a favorite so I already know its good :) Users/soldieroftafari

20091111 11:16:51 nbsp Best pizza deal ever. Wait for the coupons to arrive in the mail (there are always Papa Murphys coupons in the mail) and you can get a large pizza for only $5.99. And its delicious. I like to follow the instructions for a crispy crust. I occasionally add my own toppings. One time I asked for a cheese pizza with the cheese on the side; and they did it without any questions or snide remarks. When I got it home I added some ingredients to the sauce and added my own toppings. It was like making my own pizza without having to deal with making pizza dough. Delicious.  Users/GJC02

20100428 22:36:36 nbsp whats with the overly negative description? and there is in fact a very large difference in quality between supermarket pizza and papa murphys. . .

20100428 23:29:34 nbsp Papa Murphys has always been a solid choice, you just have to have an oven! Users/StevenDaubert

20100428 23:31:53 nbsp I love getting pizzas here. There are always coupons available and you can almost always get a family size for under ten dollars.  Users/hankim

20120412 18:19:16 nbsp I enjoy their pizzas as a fun treat, especially the DeLite flavors. Good prices. It is especially nice in the winter as its a good excuse to warm up the house with the oven. Plus, you get pizza aromatherapy. Users/gurglemeow

20120412 21:59:32 nbsp Im surprised I havent left a review here before.  Papa Murphys isnt the best pizza in Davis, but it is fairly good and just so darned cheap.  A constant stream of coupons (annoying, really... except when you get a craving for Papa Murphys!) and the stamp cards make it even cheaper.

A couple of cautions: while the pepperoni and the veggie are quite good fresh, theyre definitely subpar as leftovers, either hot or cold.  The veggie gets a little soggy from all the vegetables, while the pepperoni just isnt very tasty.  That said, the Hawaiian is as good for leftovers as it is fresh, and the Cowboy is still darn tasty.

The deLites are pretty good, but I always prefer a regular crust to the superthin one.  I havent tried the toppings on a regular crust yet, but I imagine thatd be tasty.

The one thing thats missing is a good BBQ chicken pizza.  Oh well.  Lifes tough. Users/TomGarberson

20120927 12:19:24 nbsp The big white thing in the back is a refrigerator. You will not find a freezer in ANY Papa Murphys store. Its fresh pizza exactly as you create it, hot and bubbly from your oven when youre ready to eat it! Sure beats a cold pizza from a cardboard box! Users/SherylBraun
