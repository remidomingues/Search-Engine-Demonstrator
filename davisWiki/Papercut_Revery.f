Papercut Revery is what happens when four hot guys form a band and write songs about dead chicks and greek dudes. If you like Cursive, Dredg, and good music in general youll probably like this band too.

Papercut Revery is!

Chris Knight  Vokillz, Guitar Arya Zarrinkelk  Bass and sexy poses Stephen Kurshner  Drums and Sweat Chris Saito  Guitar x 5.2

Weve been a happy, loving family of 4 for just over a year now. Weve played up and down California, including your moms house. We burn your thatched roof cottage with the fire of rock. We will poison your soul with the laced wine of roll. We will dam your rivers with an avalanche of dead girls... Because thats how you do when you settle for nothing short of complete world domination.
