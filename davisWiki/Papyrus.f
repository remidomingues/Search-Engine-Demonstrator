Papyrus is a chain stationery store. This location sold greeting cards, paper, and gift items. You could also order fancy things like Weddings wedding invitations and graduation announcements from them. They generally had a sale table up front if you were in the mood to buy random trinkets.  The location was next occupied by Pinkberry.
