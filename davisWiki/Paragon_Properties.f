Paragon Properties is a Property Management property management company started in 2011 by Lisa Navarro, formerly of Lyon Real Estate.

Currently, this company is known to manage the following rental properties in Davis: Casa del Rey Apartments (411 1st St)


20120721 18:58:01 nbsp Lisa Navarro of Paragon Properties recently took over management of Casa del Rey (411 1st St) from the previous property manager, who retired. So far, my dealings with her have been thus:

1) I was charged $65 for leaving a mattress next to the dumpster during moveout. I leave it to the reader to judge whether this is reasonable.
2) I was charged $37.50 for a cleaning fee despite cleaning the apartment thoroughly upon exit. I was informed that this was a routine cleaning charge which is charged to every tenant upon exit. Routine cleaning charges appear to be in violation of California Civil Code Section 1950.5(e).
3) To top it all off, the arithmetic on the itemized receipt was incorrect, and thus the refund check amount was less than what I was owed.
4) She has been generally unresponsive and hard to get a hold of. There are numerous instances of this, but one glaring example was the difficulty in scheduling an initial inspection of the apartment in order to assess potential damages or charges upon moveout. Eventually, I was denied the initial inspection in violation of landlord responsibilities as per California Civil Code Section 1950.5(f).

You may decide for yourself, based on these experiences, whether you wish to enter into business dealings with Ms Navarro. Further reviews may be found at the wiki page for Lyon Real Estate, where Ms Navarro worked previously. Sadly, at this stage I cannot recommend dealing with Paragon Properties either as a tenant or a property owner. Users/Annoyed

20130130 16:41:44 nbsp Serenus Hua was a tenant in an apartment building I managed. My experience was this:
1. When he moved out he left his queen size mattress propped up against the side of the apartment complex. When I called him to ask him to remove it, he denied it was his. I knew it was his because I had just seen it in his apartment when I did the premove out walk through. He later admitted it was his and complained about being charged to have it removed. Davis waste removal will not pick up mattresses with the regular garbage, and  I dont know anyone in the industry who charges $20 to haul a queen mattress to the dump. Im not inclined to spend any amount of time searching for the best deal for a tenant who should have removed it themselves.
2. I dont have routine cleaning charges. I only charge for the cleaning that is necessary upon a tenants move out. Some tenants, such as Serenus, do not understand that dirty kitchens are not acceptable.
3.  I made a .50 (yes, thats cents, not dollars) error on the security deposit disposition. I subsequently apologized for the error and issued another check immediately.
4.  I am quite easy to get in touch with. I correspond by email, phone calls and even text messages. I asked if he would like a premove out inspection, he said yes, and one was done.  I did not deny a move out inspection. Instead of scheduling a move out inspection a week in advance, Serenus wanted to be able to call me when he was done moving and have me come by. He had no idea when that would be, he just wanted me to be on call for him.

If you are the type of tenant who is inclined to lie, leave your personal property and your apartment for me to clean, never say a word to me about any issues but then attempt to paint a picture of me as a bad property mananger, then I also would recommend that you do not rent from me.

20130321 00:05:12 nbsp I dont like to get into extended arguments on the internet; however, potential renters from Paragon Properties should be aware of the following:

1) Her claims, stated above, falsely state the chain of events, and I have documentation, in the form of saved emails, texts, receipts, and check copies, to prove this. For example, I have a message from her stating that the $75 cleaning fee is standard upon moveout, and that she would generously split the charges with me (resulting in $37.50 being taken out of my security deposit). As stated above, such a charge is not legal according to California law. There are other errors and falsehoods in her story, but I dont have the time or energy to discuss them all.

2) In my case, I was forced to send her copies of her own receipts and checks in order to get any of my security deposit back from her. The arithmetic error, by the way, was $5, not $0.50. However, the reason her check needed to be reissued was because two separate banks rejected it as invalid, due to Ms Navarros multiple errors and crossouts while filling out said check.

3) The moral of the story is If you must do business with Lisa Navarro, be sure to keep all receipts and documents. Better yet, just avoid Paragon Properties entirely. Im not sure if my experience was the result of malice, or incompetence, but either way, its just not worth the headache. Users/Annoyed
