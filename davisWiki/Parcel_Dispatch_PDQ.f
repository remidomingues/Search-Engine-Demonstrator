20060810 17:40:07 nbsp Lynn Christensen has won an Enterprise voters choice award for friendliest business owner or something to that effect.  I think hes won it more than once.  He is a really nice guy. Users/JanelleAlvstadMattson

20061108 12:43:16 nbsp I always go here for notaries and Ive been here once to get a shipping quote. Everyone is extremely helpful and friendly. Its good to see that the owners won awards to attest to that fact. Great guy. Users/LiRic

20061108 16:48:16 nbsp These folks have been in business here for ages.  We shipped business packages so we were in there at least once a week. Lynn and Laura are always friendly and helpful (they own the place) but their workers are real nice too so they must be nice people to work for. Its a great place to mail stuff and they have boxes,tape, greeting cards and all that stuff.  Lynn says the PDQ stands for Pretty Darned Quick in spite of what anyone else thinks the D stands for.

20070519 04:32:16 nbsp I walked in with a broken bike frame around 4pm (think 2 1 foot on a side triangles).  They packed so small I figured I could fit them in a standard box.  The owner ran over to the bike shop, got me a old bike box (cheaper than a new one, not to mention reuse is better than recycling), then rebuilt the box to be about 2/3rds the size (again cheaper), packed it with peanuts, and sealed it up.  Total cost was $18 and the box was delivered by 9:30 am then next day.  Basically great service from great people.  Highly recommended. Users/BillBroadley

20071222 15:09:48 nbsp Outstanding customer service for years these folks really know how to deliver! :)  Very professional, friendly, honest almost to a fault (if they think you can ship something more cheaply via the post office, they tell you), helpful even to last minute people like me who rush in stressed & worried & find their troubles being all eased by this great team.  Really you just couldnt ask for them to do it better & the fact that they are a very hands on Mom & Pop operation in Davis makes me all the happier to go there.

20080702 17:01:11 nbsp Great customer service saved me money!  I brought in a large box that was going to cost $45 to send UPS  they repacked the box so it would be smaller and cost $28 less.  When I suggested they keep the change from my $20 they didnt even take the tip and just said they do this all the time. Users/rachelss

20090105 17:16:40 nbsp Ive had a lot of good luck here. I went in once to send a package to Southern California, and after helping me box it up super small they sent me to the Post Office where itd be cheaper. Ive gotten a lot of fingerprinting done as well, and the guy who does it is nice and cute. Too bad I dont know his name. Users/ChristyMarsden

20090209 03:13:02 nbsp I had my fingerprint done here the other day and also had to send a few things out. The staff here seems diverse and very friendly. Ill be returning if I have to send out any packages. Thumbs up! Users/TonyaNN

20121101 09:38:56 nbsp I went there for the first time yesterday to send a fax. I had never sent a fax before and they didnt make me feel stupid, they were extremely helpful and explained the process and did it all for me. I wasnt even sure which part of the  document to fax, told them what the person had asked for and they helped locate the right spot. I would wholeheartedly recommend them. Their price was way better than other places as well. Only $1 per page. Users/RG
