The book, called http://books.google.com/books?id_L4DnxWOJK4C&dqbaby+signs&pgPP1&ots2eBJ4lMWWq&sigcbgLX6_oAaraXuxETnR0JGTjRc&hlen&prevhttp://www.google.com/search%3Fhl%3Den%26q%3Dbaby%2Bsigns%26btnG%3DSearch&saX&oiprint&cttitle&cadonebookwiththumbnail Baby Signs, has been further developed into the https://www.babysigns.com Baby Signs Institute.
