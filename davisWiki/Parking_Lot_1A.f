The former Parking Lot 1A may have been built on the former site of a 4,000 year old Patwin sacred burial ground and village. The remains found there were moved to a new site under the supervision of a Patwin representative, and http://www.news.ucdavis.edu/search/news_detail.lasso?id7919 planning from then on took into account the wishes of Patwin representatives. There is a Native American Contemplative Garden that was built partially as a result of this finding.
The lot was replaced by the Mondavi Center.

During its construction in 1999, 13 Native Americans of the Patwin tribe were found to be buried at the site.  http://broadcast.ucdavis.edu/search/broadcast_detail.lasso?id421 this article makes mention of it, though the centerpiece is the Native American Contemplative Garden.
