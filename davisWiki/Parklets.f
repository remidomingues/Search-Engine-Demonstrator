Davis now has one parklet, with perhaps more parklets to come.  The parklet is located on E Street in front of the (nowclosed) Beach Hut Deli, Sugar Daddies, and Thai Canteen.  However, you dont have to purchase food from these restaurants to sit there; you can bring your own food if you like or just hang out without eating.  Two parking spaces were eliminated in order to increase the seating area and to make the seating more pleasant (before the parklet was put in, a car might pull up right next to your table.  Now the area feels a bit more buffered from the street).
