Nestled inside the Ushaped Hunt Hall lies a little, unassuming building: the Frank G. Parsons Seed Certification Center.  What do they do in this building?  Well, address(certify seeds, 38.543462, 121.751055), of course!

This building is apparently covered by a wiki:Wikipedia:SEP_field Somebody Elses Problem field, because after a year of working in the PES Building, Users/BrentLaabs finally noticed that this building exists.  Also note that this page hasnt been created until well after the wiki had covered every other Campus Buildings campus building.
