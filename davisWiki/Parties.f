Generally, there are two kinds of Parties: Students student parties and nonstudent parties. Student parties, usually thrown/attended by UC Davis students and sometimes Davis High School students, often revolve around alcohol and may be loud. Nonstudent parties may also have alcohol and be loud but also probably have more of a purpose to them, such as a birthday party, a graduation party, or other celebrations.

Of course, there are also Political Party political parties.

The AIM name Davispartyscene used to deliver residents a list of parties in pseudorealtime  some believe such a service might cause partyproblems or an excess of unwanted guests at parties. Perhaps a better solution would be the daviswiki.orgs Events Board. Another funky site, Facebook, also has a similar partyadvertising feature. If, in the future, an AIM bot for parties becomes available it will likely get its own page on the wiki. Toasts Cheers!  Users/StevenDaubert wonders about UCDparties (wasnt it around before partyscene? and of course the related VIP parties bot...)


 How to Throw a Party 
Heres where we school you in how to throw a party of the drinking, Learn to Dance dancing and hooking up variety.

 1. Get a noise permit, especially if a band is playing. Be sure to describe the kind of music on the noise permit folk, blues and reggae is a far easier sell than death metal  if you are having death metal, call it rock. Permits may be difficult for undergraduate students to get. see Noise Violation

 1. Talk to neighbors about your party well in advance, making sure they understand how long it will last and how big it will be.  Be honest and give your neighbors a paper with the party date, your name and phone number. Ask them to call you if the noise gets too loud or if your guests get out of hand  theyre more likely to give you a call before calling the cops! If neighbors do call, be responsible and ask your guests to keep it in control.

 1. Make a Costco food run. Provide some sort of munchies, or people become too drunk too fast. As the host, you may be held responsible for any Tragic Events injuries/accidents that occur as a result of somebody getting too drunk at your party.

 1. Plan your alcohol needs. Two to four kegs should be sufficient for a large undergraduate students undergraduate party unless you are providing hard liquor. Make it a BYOB party if you expect minors or drunks  police will hold you responsible for supplying liquor to minors. Graduate students Graduate student parties require fewer kegs and guests are more likely to contribute to your party in the form of alcohol or snacks.

 1. Anchor(prep) Partyproof your house. Spend a little money on some cheap wood stakes and a roll of black plastic, easily found at Hibbert Lumber, to create a wall around your yard and extend your party zone. Have your sober person monitor the entrance to be aware of who is attending your party and shield any acts of debauchery. Keep in mind that encouraging guests to party outside increases your chances of a noise violation!

  Close all doors and windows because police can enter through any open doors and see through open windows  this leaves you subject to the Plain View law which justifies subsequent searches.

  Make sure theres plenty of toilet paper and guests have sufficient bathrooms bathroom access... neighbors get bummed out to find your guests pissing in their yard.

 1. Be proactive in dealing with problem guests. You have just as much right as your neighbors to call the police if things start getting out of hand! To file a police report or for general information, press 0.  ... To speak to the dispatch center press 5.

 1. If the police arrive keep in mind that you can always use the line, Officer I do not consent to any searches. This, however, doesnt protect you if officers either enter through an open door or they have reason to search because of acts visible through open windows/doors see #prep Partyproof your House, above. If you experience a legitimate violation of your rights, we encourage you to post your experiences on our Police Misconduct Stories page in addition to reporting the incident and taking legal action.
