 Our Philosophy 
Children are curious – we encourage and value that!

Children create their own understanding of the world – we make sure that they actively tackle concepts!

Children engage in critical thinking – we structure tasks so that even young children can analyze and appraise what they are learning!

This is not a place for drill and worksheets, this is a place for children to think curiously, creatively and critically!  Come and see what your child can accomplish with a partner in learning!

Nice, friendly, informal atmosphere.

20090405 22:22:46 nbsp Jeri has been an unbelievable help!  My 7 year old went to her not reading and in a few short months reached grade level.  Her style both appeals to him (she is silly and knows how to talk to a little boy) and made reading finally click for him.  I cannot recommend Partners in Learning more.  It is a nice familyowned atmosphere, incredibly effective, and surprisingly affordable.  If your child is struggling in school, do not wait!  Call them ASAP.   Users/CharlieMurphy

20110209 14:16:12 nbsp My daughter’s reading progressed by leaps and bounds with tutoring by Partners in Learning. Moreover, her increased confidence carried into other subjects at school. She wants to go to tutoring. And she loves her tutor. Partners in Learning takes an individualized and personal approach to their students. I’m so glad we found them. Partners in Learning is one of the best things we have done for our daughter.  Davis parent of 2 Users/ErikaJensen

20120416 17:51:56 nbsp Partners in Learning has been very useful for my boys, and they do a great job accommodating them with tutors to meet their specific needs and learning styles.  We have used them for about 45 years now, and plan on using them in the future!

20130805 15:24:42 nbsp My son Christian receives tutoring in Math and Reading with Beth at Partners in Learning. She is great with him. Beth has a knack for getting him to open up and show what he is capable of. She uses a method of praise and encouragement that gives him a desire to push on when a subject is tough. Call Partners in Learning. You will see your child become more confident and skilled academical right before your eyes.
