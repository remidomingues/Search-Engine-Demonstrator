The Parties Party King of Davis title was invented by some students at Sac State in reference to Users/RobRoy Rob Roy while in conversation with former KDVS KDVS DJs DJ Kyle Melton (son of Barry Melton The Fish) when Kyle was hanging out at the dormitories there (2002). Some Sac States students talked about how they do not party in Sacramento because there is no centralized scene there, but instead they travel to Davis on the weekends. The students referenced Rob mainly because he had the most recognizable name of anyone living at the Pirate Ship, a house that hosted many House Shows live music shows in Davis. Kyle brought this up at a show at the Charred Dog House and Users/JenndelaVega Jenn de la Vega was so amused by it that she started to popularize the phrase.

Rob was flattered by it so he referenced it on occasion, most notably in the backyard of 748 Mulberry version of the Pirate Ship when some people told everyone that a keg was empty while also filling up their own cups  this very much angered Rob. He also referenced it during his Winter 2005 ASUCD Election campaign for ASUCD Senate, most notably in his RobotMedia music video.

Rob had a change of heart over the title in the summer of 2005. His engagement with Users/SharonZimmerman Sharon Zimmerman ended and he essentially went into hiding, spending most of his time in the Lower Freeborn basement of Freeborn Hall at KDVS recording music for his Sterling Riot project (with the exception of making presentations to the incoming class of 2009 during Summer Advising). He also severely reduced his alcohol intake at this time.

Since he no longer lives in a house that hosts frequent events and he really has been too busy since entering the political world to really deserve the title Party King, he has abdicated the title. Although, for the sake of Local Monarchs monarchal history, it could be said that whether he wants the title or not it will forever be connected to Rob Roy.

In late 2005, it was said that Users/JoshuaHeller Joshua Heller was next party king of Davis.  During the summer of 2006, Heller moved out of Davis.  Its not yet clear who will take over the throne.
