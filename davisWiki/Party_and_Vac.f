20050205 03:57:16 nbsp I think, but am not entirely sure, that the store is two seperate stores that take up two units of the complex but are run by the same people.  I took my vacuum to Kellys Sew and Vac at 1776 East 8th St. to have it repaired, and walked through the party area to the counter in the back (used also for the party supplies) to drop off the vacuum.

20050226 02:01:10 nbsp For a place selling vacuum products, they sure have a surprising amount of glitter all over the floor. Users/CraigBrozinsky

20050915 12:56:32 nbsp Just ordered a part for my Vacuum there, nice guy. Yeah, its way in the back, past the party supplies.  He quoted me a price $8 less than the nearest place in Woodland.  Seems nice enough, too. Users/DavidBenjamin

20070415 09:30:24 nbsp I adore this store.  In my hometown, okay next to my hometown, there was a Wishing Well which sold all sorts of random party favortype objects in bulk.  About once a month I would go there and stock up on bouncy balls (which I used to get peoples attention) or those Party Snaps (that you assault your friends with).  I didnt think we had anything of the sort in Davis but once again I was delightfully proved wrong. Users/KirstenOnell

20071111 20:12:54 nbsp Does anyone know if they have pi√±atas, and if they do whats the price range? :) Users/gurglemeow

20080404 12:39:36 nbsp In reference to SummerSongs comment: I heard that it used to be 2 seperate stores at one time. Then the Owners got to know eachother and fell in love. When the owners of a vaccuum store and a party store really love eachother a  Party & Vac is born. Users/MyaBrn

20080414 17:48:47 nbsp aww, i love this place. they have so many fun, inexpensive things  Users/ReginaGunn

20080427 01:36:05 nbsp They do have pinatas.  We bought one for a birthday party but we never filled it with candy so it became a pet within our apartment, named papageorgio.   I bought a belt from here that couldnt be found in ACE and the price was fair.  Users/heyitsdimo

20080510 09:48:34 nbsp Does anybody know what their return policy is? Users/juliebeans

20080706 01:29:34 nbsp I like the party part, but the vac part is a bit lacking: we ordered a belt for our vacuum and never heard back, then when we called we were told that actually the belt didnt exist so it hadnt been ordered...we found it ourselves online later after about 4 seconds of searching.

20090220 13:49:22 nbsp They were really nice about refilling the mylar balloons that I took in  that type of balloon can actually be reused quite a bit! Users/MargaretaLelea

20090329 08:46:24 nbsp While I have had good experiences purchasing party supplies here, I have had two bad experiences with sewing machine repairs now.  Hoping the first time was a lark, I brought my machine in because it was having problems sewing through a specific material.  I left a note and drew out how it was incorrectly sewing and taped some sample material to it and explained how to reproduce the problem.  The machine wasnt ready when they said it would be, and when it was, they walked out carrying the machine by the covers handle, even though there was a note taped at the handle saying not to lift it by the handle.  I took it home and discovered they had completely disregarded my note and the machine still had the same problem.  I brought it back and the store was ~ 30 min late to open.  When I asked about the repair, the man said that my machine cant sew through that material, to which I responded that I have been sewing through that material for six months.  Then he stopped to take a call and helped another customer in the store in the middle of our conversation.  When he returned, he went on to say that my needle had been backward, which I find very unlikely.  He did tell me how the thread can jump, and I appreciate that, and the solution was that I went home and adapted my machine with some scotch tape and it was fine.  I ended up spending $50 for very poor service.  The Woodland sewing machine store on the other hand has excellent service and although I prefer shopping locally, it is definitely worth the trip.

20091105 15:19:49 nbsp I really enjoy this store. The husband and wife team are very helpful. Their party supplies are always up to date and if you are looking for something specific they will get it for you. I needed some St Pattys day items for Halloween and they pulled out the boxes from the back to help me out. The prices are pretty good and the quality of stuff is excellent. My roommates and I have also taken our vacuum to this place to get serviced. They completely cleaned out the vacuum and unclogged the tubing. They did a great job and the fee was very reasonable. It was like we had a brand new vacuum cleaner. This is also a great place to get balloons.   Users/ElizabethBarthel

20110410 01:36:39 nbsp Expensive in there and the guy isnt always to knowledgeable about the products. I was going to a game and decided to go all out and get some hair dye for team spirit. He assured me it would wash out...It didnt :( I ended up shaving my head. Users/Dozer

20110419 23:02:08 nbsp This is one of those cool amateur family stores where you can find a lot of random things that you might need for a costume or a party. I found a really awesome uniform hat here, the kind an oldfashioned cop would wear. Users/jsogul

20110528 16:02:24 nbsp I would not recommend going to this place if you need a vacuum repair. I took my (albeit old) vacuum cleaner in to get fixed and was quoted a price of ~$200. When I brought it to a different store for a second opinion, they cleaned some hair out and it worked just like new. Needless to say, I will never bring anything back there to be repaired.
