Note: In California, Pasilla is the name given to the Poblano chile, even though they are completely different variants. Keep this in mind as you read the following entry and when you go grocery shopping. http://www.gourmetsleuth.com/equivalents_substitutions.asp?indexP&tid1744 (real) Poblano chile, http://www.gourmetsleuth.com/equivalents_substitutions.asp?indexC&tid2323 (real) fresh Pasilla chile

The Pasilla chile is a relative of the Bell Pepper and is a staple in Mexican cuisine. Davisites might enjoy cooking with this chile if theyre bored of the more popular traditional Bell Peppers that are available at all grocery stores. Theyre also excellent substitutions for the nonCA Pasilla chile and Chile Negro (the dried nonCA Pasilla).

If youre looking to buy fresh Pasilla chiles in Davis, you can likely find them at Farmers Market and any of the many grocery stores and ethnic markets. They look like elongated green Bell Peppers and are about a third as spicy as red Tabasco Sauce (10001500 wiki:Wikipedia:Scoville_scale Scoville units versus 25005000 SU for the sauce). When choosing a fresh Pasilla chile, pick the darker ones with a firm, wrinklefree skin.

The dried Pasilla chiles are black and come in bags about the size of your head. Look in the foreign food sections of the pseudomulticultural Albertsons or the North Davis Safeway. The flavor of the dried Pasilla is reminiscent of raisins and bell peppers, and they are often used as a paste or powder in Southwestern and Mexican recipes.  To release the full flavor of these dried chiles, boil in water for about 10 minutes or until soft.

Heres a simple recipe you may want to try as an introduction to the Pasilla chile (feel free to experiment):
 Grilled & Stuffed Fresh Pasilla Chiles 
 Ingredients: 

 Directions: 
Prepare the chiles by cutting all the way around the stem so that you can remove the stem and seed base in 1 piece. Keeping the stem and top intact, trim off any seeds and membranes, and remove any seeds left behind in the chiles. Blanch the chiles for 2 minutes in lightly salted boiling water. Remove the chiles, refresh in ice water, and drain.

Combine the grated cheeses in a bowl and mix well. Stuff each chile with about 1/2 cup of the cheese mixture. Do not overstuff or pack the cheese in too densely. Replace the stem and top of the chile.

Cook on a grill over a medium fire, turning frequently until the cheeses are melted and the chiles are hot all the way through.

Serve on a bed of your favorite salsa. Enjoy!
