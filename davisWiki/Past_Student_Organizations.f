While there are many active student organizations, there is a long list of past student organizations that have become moribund, ended in either a whimper or bang, or simply became something new.  Some may resurface, or their cause be taken on by new groups.


Past student organizations include:

  Public Health for Undergraduates  No longer active
  Junior Investors and Entrepreneurs  Founded in 2007, became the Student Investors and Entrepreneurs in 2010.
