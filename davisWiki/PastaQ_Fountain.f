The Pasta? Fountain is a Water Fountains Water Fountain and a piece of Town Art.  The fountain, which is next to the Pasta Q restaurant, conists of a circular path down which water pours and finally falls into a grate.  You can sit in the benches just beneath it, or if youre a kid, stick your hands in it and be mesmerized.
