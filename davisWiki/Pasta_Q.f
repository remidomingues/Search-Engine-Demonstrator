Tres Hermanas opened at this location in September 2010.




Less expensive than Osteria Fasulo and more classy/Yuppies yuppie than Davis other Italian restaurants, Pasta? is an ideal place to have a Decent Well Liquor drink, go on a Good Ideas For Dates date, or eat some pasta. The appetizers are uniformly good, but the pasta itself is variable in quality  the salmon fettuccine is delectable but the pesto is obviously canned. According to their menu, fresh pastas include ravioli, fettuccine, and gnocchi, but do not include string and tube shaped pastas.

Fresh and dried pasta dishes tend to cost the same here, but dried pasta can be bought anywhere and cooked by anyone with ease. Fresh pasta is more expensive for purchase, typically tastier, time intensive for the average home cook, and sometimes requires expensive equipment. A good dried commercial pasta can rival fresh pasta, but given the rarity of fresh pasta in American restaurants, choosing the fresh items may get the best bang for your buck. Pasta? is run by real Italian people so they should be trusted as to its authenticity instead of some standard people already have in their head, possibly Olive Garden. The creativity and skill of the staff is more important than adherence to a standard.


There is also an unusual combination bench and fountain on the corner. If youre curious, one of the businesses directly above is The Style Lounge.

There are also Pasta? restaurants in:
  Palo Alto
  Mountain View


Directly in front of the restaurant is a PastaQ Fountain fountain.

They run a pretty good bar during the school year, which is sadly closed during summertime.

  Pasta? was one of the bars Davis Life Magazine visited and wrote about in their http://www.davislifemagazine.com/Content.aspx?m1/1/2009&cId2483 2009 review of seven local bars.


20050425 14:13:29 nbsp Ive had the Fusilli con salsiccia a couple times and thought it was pretty good.  We did have an odd experience once when all of our group happened to order dishes with different sauces but the dishes all came out with rather similar looking orangey sauces. shrug We happened to go for their opening night and it was pretty neat to have the owner wandering around checking on the dishes and talking to the patrons. Users/RussBowlus

20050608 21:01:36 nbsp Not worth it.  Better to make pasta yourself or drive to Sac.  This place purports to fill a gap in Davis dining, but is consistently mediocre, betting on students not knowing the difference (or caring about the difference) between good italian and overcooked pasta in secondrate sauce. Users/EllenWoodall



I like to get the Tarantina because they always do a great job with the mussells and you cant ask for a better staff. I am first generation Italian and they get it extremely close being from Napoli and Forenza. It confuses some people who arent from back East or overseas to eat here because it doesnt taste like Olive Garden which your mediocre tastebuds think is delicious. The bar scene at night is really chill too. Users/JonathanNasca

20050620 01:53:29 nbsp A restaurant should superbly make simple dishes, or make dishes too complex for the home cook. The menus simplest pasta dishes, the Angry Pasta and Pesto, were lacking in depth. The Angry Pasta was dominated by bland herbs, and lacked the intense hints of garlic and spice that normally flavor this dish. The pesto was an oily, weakish green sauce devoid of nuttiness. Indeed, one of the staff revealed it to be from a jar, a cardinal sin for a cuisine that thrives on fresh ingredients. Ive been told the ravioli and gnocci are worth trying. Their regular pastas are okay quality, but I couldnt tell the difference between them and good quality dried pastas. Their seafood pasta dishes are good, but the overuse of dairy products makes their pasta sauces too uniform in character. The appetizers are great, and I enjoy soaking up the musselss sauce w/ bread. And for the record, Im from a predominately Italian region of NY, have been to Naples, and detest the Soylent stylings of Olive Garden. Users/CraigBrozinsky

20050711 19:48:11 nbsp I had a rather homophobic experience here from a waiter and I have no plans on going back Users/BobGill

20050717 15:59:24 nbsp Even the bread was stale. Does it get any more pretentious than this? Users/NoelBruening

20050726 17:20:11 nbsp I love their Spaghetti Bella Napoli the most.  They are mostly polite, and depending upon the times you go, their service can be pretty good. Users/MindyYang

20050726 19:11:54 nbsp I ate lunch here months ago.  My girlfriend had, and liked, the gnocci, and I had raviolli in the pink sauce (mix of normal and the creamy sauce).  Service was fine, food was alright but pricey for what you get.  Users/Edwins ES

20050728 01:08:53 nbsp Cant say that Ive had their namesake plate however I did get the vegetarian sandwich (full of roasted veg and pesto) and asked them to put proscuitto in it...and they did! I got hooked up fat plus I wasnt charged extra. The balsamic vinegrette could have been tastier but not bad. Our bread was actually quite good and it flowed like crazy. But do NOT get the tiramisu. It was most disappointing, which for an Italian place, it should not. But their chocolate tartufo was worth it. ) But for some reason we were not given water. This has been a trend lately. Strange. Users/KarlaFung

20050810 19:01:35 nbsp One of my favorites, good dishes are the gnocchi, ravioli (shrimp and lobster on special were amazing), and the Tarantina. Service is good, the bread could use a little work.  Users/MelissaPytlak

20050816 19:24:47 nbsp In spite of all the nasty comments, I have to give them a very strong recommendation.  I had about 20+ people there for dinner for my 21st birthday, and everything went without a hitch.  Unlike some businesses (cough cough Caffe Italia), Pasta? had no problem with a wishywashy number of guests (so long as they had a general idea of how many people).  They asked how I wanted the tables to be arranged (hee hee Last Supper style), and there wasnt a glass of water or a bread basket that ever made it to empty.  They gave us two servers; everyones drinks/appetizers came out at the same time, and miraculously, not one person was left playing with their fork waiting for the entree to come out...everyone received theirs, hot, at the same time.  Further, EVERYONES order was right, which is often surprising, given that Chevys cant get a twoperson order correct to save their lives.  I also appreciate the fact that they have a decent number of nocheese and vegetarian options (with a certain special someone of mine being lactose intolerant).  They have excellent fettucini alfredo and that tomato/clams (mussels?) pasta dish is superb.  Gotta give them props.  Users/JulieEickhof

20050819 15:13:32 nbsp I went here once on a Thursday night with a few friends of mine. After about ten minutes after arriving, this absolutely ridiculously drunk guy came up to my friend at the bar, unsuccessfully hit on her, told me that he was sorry, but your friend is FIIIIINE, then bit her on the shoulderblade. Beware of the sketchy clientele at the bar.  Users/JoannaHeiple

20050823 12:38:39 nbsp Their fettucini alfredo is not impressive.  Since fettucini alfredo is a classic, and they cant seem to do it right, Im not quite impressed by the place.  Fuzios is better. Users/AndreaPasiliao
  Well, if theyre claiming to be authentic Italian, this is understandable. Although Fettucine Alfredo was invented in Italy (ca 1914), its neither traditional nor popular there. But your point is taken combined with some of the above comments, it seems to be the case that both their authentic and americanized dishes are lacking.

20050922 17:07:45 nbsp The owner and maitre d are from Bari, on the Adriatic coast not far from Taranto.  So eat the seafood dishes, they are close to the heart of the restauranteurs.  Its my favorite restaurant in Davis...but I think olive oil, garlic and mollusks are three of the four basic food groups. Users/MarcusSitz

20051104 19:39:32 nbsp If you like clams, their Bella Napoli is really really ridiculously good! Ive been comparing similar clam dishes in Strings and Cafe Italia, and nothing compares to this. For one thing, Pasta? serves it with the shell so it tastes fresh and oh so juicy (unlike the canned and bottled versions that the other restaurants seem to use)!! The Tarantina is also a good mussel dish with calamari and spicy tomato sauce. Service is fairly good, depending who you get.  Theres always someone to provide more bread and water, so thats nice. You can also call in for pickup and theyre pretty quick to prepare your order.  Users/MarianneDominguez

20051121 15:17:00 nbsp Strangely unauthentic Italian food for a restaurant owned and operated by real Italians.  But for an American audience, it beats Olive Garden or Strings.  I had the Penne Norcina, which was pretty tasty.  My wife could not finish her extremely overcooked Gnocchi.  The coffee (by that I mean espresso) is better than most restaurants or for that matter most cafes in Davis.  They use Miscela dOro coffee.  My shot was pretty good, though a little long.  Overall pretty decent, but it is what it is. Users/DjzayValenta
  Nevermind!  Dont bother!  I went there this last Friday with my wife.  Not only had they raised the prices on the mediocre food YET AGAIN, but service was spotty at best (again) and the food was worse than normal.  On top of that, my wife and I had the exact same dish, and we BOTH got sick.  I  have been to Pasta? a half dozen times simply because it is convenient and I didnt have high expectations.  Now I will never go back.  Since they keep raising the prices, they are now about the same as Caffe Italia.  I will go there from now on. Users/DjzayValenta

20051121 16:20:54 nbsp I think the pretentiousness is amusing.  The food is pretty good for the money, and Ive found the service to be worth a higherthannormal tip.   The fact that this place is next to a train station and is in a generally pedestrianfriendly area seals the deal for me  Ill happily go back. Users/GrahamFreeman

20051123 22:13:01 nbsp Pasta wasnt cooked ideally, and the salmon kind of tasted like it came out of a can (too silky to be fresh/real). Not bad, just kind of oversalted. The bread was good, as was the salad. Service was pretty fast, although the waiter was inconsistent with his service to our table. He still got a decent tip for being friendly. Not really authentic, but Im not going to cross it off of my list.   Users/AndrewLeonard

20051209 15:38:27 nbsp Last night I saw the owner doing coke in the bathroom. It was awesome! Users/ArlenAbraham

20051214 10:46:27 nbsp This place is kinda disappointing. I like the atmosphere and found the service pretty impressive, but then, why does the food suck? I dont understand why the pasta I ordered was such a small dish, or why it tasted so bland. But Im not willing to pay $9 for crap food. I may go back to see if it was maybe just what I ordered. SS

20060107 09:54:31 nbsp This place seems to garner a bevy of negative comments. Fortunately (for the restaurant), I dont agree with them. I went there last night for dinner and overall it was a great experience. We had a 7pm dinner reservation, but due to a crazy amount of people all showing up at one time, it took 5 minutes for them to seat us. That did not really bother me; it was nice to see a restaurant so full of life. Once we were seated, we had bread and olive oil  as soon as we got to the last piece, our waiter showed up. Walter, our waiter was a really cool guy from the Adriatic Coast of Italy. We ordered two pasta dishes  one straight from the menu and one with a special request (no cheese). The request was graciously accommodated. Our food came out very quickly, despite how busy it was. After dinner, the waiter offered me a traditional Italian afterdinner drink  Italian espresso. Overall, Pasta? was a great, pretty authentic experience. I will definitely go back there again. Users/GregHirson

20060113 10:10:02 nbsp My wife and I went on a Friday night and the service was atrocious. The bartender was surly and incompetent and the waitstaff harried and inexperienced.  I spoke to the owner/GM about it and he said they were a few waiters short that night but it was most definitely a poorlymanaged and poorlystaffed establishment.

20060113 14:59:44 nbsp The gnocchi isnt baked.. its just boiled.. a bit of  a letdown if  you know your gnocchi. Users/JulienBiewerElstob


The gnocchi is just the type of dumpling pasta, the words after it will let you know how it is prepared and FYI the most common i.e. default preparation for gnocchis is to boil, followed by baking, followed by a simmer in light Northern sauces. Jonathan Nasca


20060130 14:04:03 nbsp Whats with the question mark?  Are patrons supposed to guess that theyre going to have pasta? Users/JohnNapier

20060212 00:48:27 nbsp Simply put this place sux. I was hoping for a better selection of pasta and antipasti. There wasnt. I went here with my dad and we found the food so god awful that both of us were gonna puke. My relatives are Italian and coming from a very Italian family I have to say this place was an insult. To top that off the chef kept on coming over to us to validate whether the food was good or not. The only response that I could dignify was uh... We also had the merlot here and sadly it was bland and very odious. Also avoid the bar unless u want to have a horribly bad taste in ur mouth. If you really want some good Italian food go to Osteria Fasulo. For even better Italian food make the drive to the Italian Quarter in SF, North Beach to be exact.  Users/MikeMele

20060222 19:27:34 nbsp Theyre desserts are really good, especially the chocolate fondant cake and the chocolate souffle. :) Users/VivianPham

20060315 21:19:39 nbsp I recommend the bruschetta, spaghetti tarantina and spaghetti bella napoli. Waiters are a kind of creepy.  Users/JessicaFu

20060319 18:20:35 nbsp The food is decent.  I always get the Tarantina.  Girls, prepare to be hit on a lot.  It doesnt matter if youre underage.  The waiters will probably hit on you. Users/KevinRollins

20060319 19:21:25 nbsp Decent food. Not really authentic at all, imagine like.. decent Americanized Italian food trying to be authentically Italian, and that is what this place tastes like.  It always seems to be busy though.  The prices arent too bad either, but granted, it is just pasta. Users/JulienBiewerElstob


Wow this is the most ridiculous comment . Have you ever been to Italy? Just because this doesnt taste like the Olive Garden or Sbarro does not mean its not authentic which it is (for Neopolitan food) so you may want to cut out on the wordly talk ....Jonathan Nasca



20060504 20:04:47 nbsp Ive been there several times.  The only bad thing that ever happened was that they forgot our bread but really it just saved us calories:)  My husband and I almost always get  the fusilli con salsiccia.  We can share that plate then share a dessert and it ends up being a relatively cheap date in a cute restaurant.  I also had my husbands graduation dinner there and although we were all late after the ceremony, they did a great job serving, and everyone went home happy! Users/JenCam

20060526 08:56:29 nbsp Dissappointed. The atmosphere was excellent. It looked very nice inside and out, but the food was questionable. The menu looked like it only have two sauces, and I went there with my family, tried both sauces and not impressed. Definitly overpriced, notsogood pasta? Users/AlexKang

20060820 14:03:56 nbsp Ive never been to Italy myself, but it seems hilarious to me that anyone would defend this as being in any way authentic Italian food. Perhaps dishes are OK for the price: if you take into consideration the location, rent, etc. but why open up a restaurant and then be forced to serve medium/smallish portions of crappy pasta? And on that note: why open up a restaurant called pasta ? that doesnt serve housemade pasta?  Anyway: have eaten there three times, food was disappointing price seemed high for level of mediocrity. Would recommend against eating there. Users/DianaChristofersen


Wow, youve never been to Italy and yet you find it amusing that the food is considered authentic?  I lived in Italy for 3 months.  Go to Italy, and then come back.  Many of the dishes are exactly what you would find in Italy.  Seems a little naive..... annoyed user

200608903  20:47 nbsp  I went there today for dinner and the service was so slow.  Im talking about waiting forever to just get our orders and then FOREVER to get the check.  You would think that they would want the money but apparently not... it wasnt even that busy either!  The food was only okay and to be honest, probably wouldnt eat here again.  Had the tube pasta with italian bacon and onions.  Bf had the gnocci, not great.  And the bread was cold :(  The only redeeming part of dinner was how the waiters refilled out water very quickly (the only thing that was quick that night).  Sorry, but in my opinion, if you want to have pasta, dont go to Pasta with the question mark.  Users/KatYu

20060921 14:20:33 nbsp I dont know why there are so many negative comments here. My boyfriend and I eat there regularly and weve always left happy. I was particularly impressed when I ordered this seafood dish one time (cant remember the name, but I want to say it was the Taranto) that contained mussells and calamari. I wasnt in the mood for mussells that day so I asked them to leave that out. Not only did they get that part correct, they gave me A TON of extra calamari. I have to say that alone earned them major brownie points. It also didnt hurt that the pasta sauce (nice and spicy) was just about perfect. The Penne Norcina is also quite delicious if youre not a tomatoe sauce person. Hands down the best Italian restaurant in Davis, especially for the price (low to moderate for Italian). Users/TiffanyHsieh

20061009 16:40:18 nbsp You would think that since theyre called Pasta? they would have good pasta. But things seem to all look similar and you can maybe try goin to safeway and buy a good sauce and cook it yourself for like 1/10 of the price.   Users/KiwiSelina

20061022 07:25:57 nbsp I generally like this place.  We take our 20 month old daughter there a lot and the atmosphere is very pleasant and she likes their gnocci.  I agree with many writers here that the food is not anything to die for but once you accept that this is not a top notch Italian place the food is fine.  However, any time we have been when it is crowded has been rough in terms of the service.  And this past Friday night was a disaster (it was homecoming night).  Simply put, they did not have even close to enough staff.  It took 30 minutes or so for them to even take our order.  We got our salads 20 minutes later.  And our food never came.  We finally ended up leaving.  The staff was trying hard but they just did not have enough people.  On a positive note  they told us we did not have to pay for the salads.   Users/JonathanEisen

20061110 21:34:31 nbsp Agree with all the Gnocchi comments. Its not very good. It has a good location, but not much else going for it. Users/ErwinSena

20061114 23:34:09 nbsp Pasta? Overpriced? Mediocre food? Annoying staff? Yes. Users/DavisDavis

20061128 17:17:14 nbsp Ive been to Pasta? (goddamn that question mark is annoying) several times with my girlfriend, and a couple times with her and another friend.  I like the gnocchi, but I also dont pretend to know anything about authentic Italian cuisine.  If youre an average guy and you like pasta, chances are youll like it.  The service is usually slow, and the wait staff can be pretentious.  Also, some of the waiters seem to think that its ok to only refill the drinks of the ladies that you are with, and ignore your requests for water.  If this happens, just do what I did; dont leave them a tip.  I spent half of my meal thirsty because they wouldnt bring water.  If my girlfriend didnt insist on going back (she likes the salmon dish,)  I wouldnt go back. Users/DominicCardenas

20061205 15:28:44 nbsp Went to Pasta? for lunch on a Friday, and had a great experience.  We went with a native Italian, and we joke on the way in that they probably dont speak Italian here.  But, we did have a native Italian waiter, and he was great.  He spoke Italian with us, and gave us gift coupons.  Food was good  I recommend the Lasagna or the seafood pasta (Tarantina).  One of us had a more bland pasta dish.  Id give this restaurant a 4 out of 5.  Users/RudyGramage

20070206 18:09:10 nbsp Pasta?  Probably closed?  Last night?  Because?  Mondays?  Are slow? Users/JeffSpeckles

20070214 21:19:09 nbsp Worse service ever! Hostess was a buffoon. Server did not great me until 40 minutes after I sat down. Manager was a complete Jerk. It was on Valentines Day too. If you want a special occassion ruined, go to Pasta? in Davis. The one in Mountain View has better service. I honestly think the drive is worth it compared to wasting a minute of your life at the one here in Davis. Users/JennaStallard

20070219 11:41:41 nbsp I went here with friends and the second we walked in my girlfriend complained that the place smelled absolutely foul and weird. The food is overpriced for the stupidly small portions they serve you. Everything looked like a waste of money, so I bought the Bruschetta appetizer. I will admit, it was very fresh and tasty with the tomatoes, but each of the four pieces of toasted bread was not worth a dollar. Two of my friends paid 9 dollars each for like 8 pieces of ravioli. I think this place is a horrible waste of a cool name, location, and Italian ambiance.  Users/CoreyPham

20070228 18:26:14 nbsp I could make most of their dishes better at home, which wouldnt be such a bad thing if the prices were lower. But theyre not, so thumbs down. Users/BriannaBetancourt

20070310 20:55:01 nbsp The gnocchi with norcina sauce is good. The muscle/clams appetizer is very good. The insalata Caprese is good. The prices are a direct result of the location. If you want good service, request to be seated in Walters area. Quite a few of the servers are Italian. Walter is from Bari, Italy, and is the best server in the place. Its always clean, and the food is the best Italian in town.  Users/CeciliaGabrielli

20070701 03:07:10 nbsp Pasta? is silly. Its the only bar Ive ever been kicked out of, and it was when my friend and I were the _completely_ sober drivers. Apparently, we had to much to drink. I will give em this: they can make some strong drinks at the bar. Users/MichaelAWoods

20070728 19:33:01 nbsp Really disappointing food. I was excited when it opened but after my partner and I ate there once, we never returned. The marinara, cream and pesto sauces were either bland and tasteless, too oily, or overly creamy and lacking in flavor. The bread was stale and the salad was poor. Id argue that their sauces taste canned rather than fresh. Honestly, I make much better pasta at home! Users/GradStudent06

20070810 15:23:21 nbsp Ugh, disappointed for the second time. the first time i went i thought i just ordered the wrong thing. Second time wasnt any better. The food their is poorly seasoned and they try to compensate for it by adding lots of salt. Service is ok but nothing special same goes for the ambiance. Definitely not worth the prices. Better off just going to the Bistro for a couple more bucks. Or Cafe Italia if you want to stick with Italian food.  Users/AmyYang

20080120 23:01:50 nbsp Very bland food.  Im not a fan of this place. Users/Dr.Lindsay

20080121 23:31:21 nbsp An honest question: How many of the Its not authentic comments here are from people who know what real Italian food is? The cuisine of Italy differs dramatically throughout the country. The majority of Pasta?s dishes most closely resembling those of the southern regions. Another issue is that truly authentic Italian food doesnt match the American pallet, for the most part, and would not thrive in an area lacking a large Italian population.

With that said, I have always found the food to be tasty, although the restaurant is understaffed at times. It seems to always be packed on Friday and Saturday nights, so going other nights of the week may be a better option if youre in a hurry. It seems satisfied customers go back, and unsatisfied customers write about it on the internet.

20080202 02:27:11 nbsp Just got back from there during the night club hours. Had an aweful experience. I asked the bartender (Some douche with a Goatee) to get me a patron on the rocks. He comes back with a glass full of ice and patron about 40% full. I tell him that drinks on the rocks are supposed to be drinks filled with ice, and then filled with your choice of beverage. He responds with, Do you want me to get you a smaller glass? Drinks on the rocks are 1 shot of alchohol filled with ice. I tipped him out of pity. What a loser. Dont go there Users/Jonny

20080209 18:19:34 nbsp Pretty good but on the salty/heavy side. That seems par for the course for Italian restaurants for some reason. Dont know why, because its not normal for your average Italian homecooked meal. Still, I dont understand the bevy of negative comments.  Users/StellaChiara

20080218 14:01:55 nbsp I went there with my daughter last week and it isnt more classy than Davis other Italian restaurants.  That is only technically true at best.  The salads are downright boring and the pasta dishes are just okay.  Fuzio is better.  The pasta there is more interesting and they are about the same price.

However, Thursday night my friends and I were hanging out at the bar...and the bartender was a COMPLETE jerk and extremely rude. I asked him if he could make a mojito...his reply uhhh you really expect me to crush up a bunch of mint leaves just for you while all these other people wait? A simple no would have sufficed. Needless to say, I am not going back there again for drinks.

20080316 20:06:21 nbsp To the patron on the rocks comment, you clearly have never worked in a restaurant or bar, otherwise you would know that the standard pour for any single alcohol, rocks, up, or however you order it, is a simple few second count that is equivalent to a shot.  He could have put it in a smaller glass if it made you feel better, but its still the same amount.  He happens to be the best bartender in Davis.
Honestly, I think all of you who have insisted on critizing the restaurant so strongly should all give yourselves a taste of the retaurant business before complaining.  I have a feeling those comments would be quickly retracted. Users/italia7

Their nightclub can be good fun as well with a core set of really good DJs who each spin once a week...usually no cover... Friday a french DJ plays a mix of electronic/pop. Other nights are House...HipHop... Gets crowded and can be difficult to get a drink sometimes but they started a beer only table, and that seems to be relieving some of the pressure on the bartenders so they can turn out mixed drinks much quicker. Yeah, about the Patron, what difference does it make whether you have the same amount of alcohol on ice in a small glass (so that it looks full) or in a larger glass (so that it doesnt look full)? Maybe a drink on the rocks is supposed to traditionally be served in a short glass, but so what?

The staff and bartenders are really pleasant, and all of the female servers are very easy on the eyes, which is never a bad thing. Never had a problem with service. The bartender with the goatee is actually a great guy. Stop in to have a drink and chat with him on an uncrowded night and youll see. There is a female Brazilian server / assistant manager who is particularly sweet and charming. The manager Marcello is Italian and is a great guy as well. The food is really good for the most part, some dishes better than others. Fish dishes are usually great!

To provide a different perspective from some of the complainer comments, I think the price/portion value is quite good actually. They give you a lot of food. Someone mentioned being disappointed paying 8 bucks for a spinach salad that consisted of spinach leaves and some toasted walnuts. Well, this might come as a surprise to believers of the Supersize It philosophy, but the American assumption that more is better is not always the case. Some salads are simple, and the ingredients in the salads are listed on the menu. If the spinach salad didnt sound good to you for 8 bucks, then why did you order it? Duh! To me that kind of reaction translates into Im cheap and cant appreciate simplicity so I feel ripped off if everything under the sun is not thrown in my dish. I have tried Caffe Italia several times, for breakfast and dinner, and have left every time thinking the food was absolutely horrible... horrible as in the worst food in Davis... particularly at that price point... its not even authentic American Italian let alone authentic Italian Italian... but I guess you do get to draw on your table with crayons at Caffe Italia, so depending on the artistic skills of your dining companions, you might walk out with a priceless piece of artwork... Id rather skip the meal and pay my little nephew to sketch me a masterpiece! So to say the prices at Pasta are starting to approach the prices at Caffe Italia as if it were a bad thing doesnt really make much sense to me.

If you grew up thinking the Spaghetti Factory is where its at as far as Italian is concerned, you should probably stick with Caffe Italia. Otherwise, give Pasta? a try, youll probably enjoy yourself. Users/davisfugitive

20080508 19:40:19 nbsp Ive arrived in Davis in April and I can say that this is the best place to have lunch (and dinner during the week). Of course it will not be the best dinner ever during weekend due to the huge amount of people there. Users/Fede

20080509 19:42:20 nbsp Pasta? as a place to party on ThursSat nights seems to have replaced Sogas. Its definitely a lot nicer, cleaner (doesnt smell like beer stained carpets), and bigger. Oh yah, the toilets are also not clogged every 2 seconds. I also feel like there are a lot less sleezy, older dudes at Pasta?. My only beef with this place  the bartenders. Theyre rude, arrogant, lack bar tending knowledge, and seem like they hate their jobs (Im speaking of two in particular, Ill let you guess which ones). You have to wait a decent amount of time to get a drink (I guess like everywhere else), but the atmosphere is great if you like to dance!  Users/UCD4thyr

  To the Person above, The Bartenders at Pasta? are amazing especially Dante and Damien, they are never anything but nice and make great drinks, if you were a Davis regular you would know they were the bartenders at Cantina also and kept the place running over there, The DJs are now great, listen to what you request and actually play it too.  Users/DavisResident23


I completely agree with the above comment  the bartenders are fabulous and extremely knowledgeable  better than anyone else in town.


20080513 23:49:25 nbsp Ive eaten here for both Dinner and Lunch. Lunch is pretty good, but can get expensive if you dont do their 8 dollar deal. Dinner is really good. My husband and I both love the mushroom appetizer and my husband LOVES the Gnocchi with white truffle cream sauce. Yummy. Very rich and creamy. Users/JamieParker

20080530 22:28:19 nbsp The pasta is still very good.  Unfortunately, the portions are miserably small and not a very good value, even for very tasty pasta.  Fortunately, they serve bread with the meal, so you have enough food.  Unfortunately, if they run out of bread (as they did tonight), and arent able to get more (because their bread supplier, Village Bakery, has shut down for the night, you are left with a very small portion of tasty but overpriced pasta, and the desire to do something about that hungry feeling you still have by finding another place to get something inexpensive.  Despite this place having the best pasta Ive found in Davis so far, I dont go here very often because of the combination of high prices and tiny portions (even with the normally available bread).  If they lowered their prices, I would come here much more often.  If they gave you enough food that I was not really hungry afterwards, I would come here more often too.  But the combination of small portions and high prices means that I rarely get dinner here.  Given that pasta, or its ingredients, are very inexpensive, and that it would probably only increase their cost by a few cents to increase the portion sizes, and that they would pick up much extra business (and therefore profit) if they did so, I would think that they might want to provide larger portions.  But hey, I dont run the place... Users/IDoNotExist

20080614 17:52:50 nbsp Went with 2 friends, had the Carpaccio, which was pretty good (Im certainly no expert), friends had pasta dishes.  Like most other Davis restaurants, I only order things I cant make at home (this eliminates pasta and chicken dishes).  Verdict: only go here if theres a particular Italian dish youve never had before (or never had right or cant get elsewhere in Davis), its worth the money to know its made correctly.  Inexplicably crowded after 10pm on ThursdaySaturday nights.  Drinks are about average for Davis, people! Users/davisGeek

20080614 19:00:41 nbsp Perhaps it is crowded then because most restaurants in Davis close by 10, and most of those that are left are fast food or pizza places.  Note that the kitchen appears to close about 1/2 an hour before the restaurant does.  (I learned this the hard way.)   Users/IDoNotExist

20080705 14:46:35 nbsp I enjoyed Pasta Q! Im quite picky about Italian eateries in America because they are usually really bad. (Not a fan of americanized cuisines.) Pasta Q actually tasted good. I had their clam pasta which was delicious, a bit light on flavor but good. They used cherry tomatoes which was a bit disappointing, would ave preferred sundried tomatoes. The service was good. Atmosphere is okay. Love how they refill the bread! Users/islandboy12

20081025 03:52:09 nbsp Just ate here tonight with my girlfriend. It was a good experience. She had the dumplings, I had the pasta al pamadoro. both were very good, however I must say the portions could be upped a bit for the price. We were treated very well and were seated and served promptly. I recommend Pasta? and will be going back soon. Users/smittyhoy

20081026 16:00:52 nbsp I went here a few times, once for lunch, a couple times for dinner.

Ive always had at least a decent experience here.  Most of the food ranges from slightly above average to really good, though I usually stick with the safe stuff like fettucine alfredo/al Pesto, gnocchi, or the lasagna.  Of those dishes, their gnocchi and lasagna particularly stands out.  Service has always been friendly, and the interior feels clean.

I must comment on the bread here.  When I came for lunch, I could not stop eating it, especially after asking for butter (yank, I know).  Both the times I came for dinner, however, the bread was a little tough and perhaps even stale. Users/BrandonWong

20081028 15:45:43 nbsp I had fettuccini alfredo with chicken, and it was nothing remarkable. I could make it myself at home with no effort. Its fairly overpriced considering how bland it was. I was not able to finish my portion, but people with bigger appetites can easily finish it in one sitting. Overall, I wouldnt go there again. Users/Kiran

20090109 15:07:55 nbsp My reaction after eating there for dinner last night was, Meh. Users/OscarSabino

20090203 16:28:55 nbsp I have been to Pasta? four times in the past year and a half. The first time the place was good, had the clams in spicy tomato sauce on linguini and my husband had gnocchi with truffle cream sauce, which he raved about. But that experience wasnt enough for us to remember to come back for a long time. The second time I went for lunch with girlfriends and sat outside. Again, it was good, but not enough to want to come back any time soon. The third time was in Dec. 08, about 8 months after that last lunch. This time our experience was MUCH more impressive. Having arrived at the height of dinner hour, we opt to eat at the bar. Being just the two of us, it wasnt that bad, however, the bartender was very busy and did not pay as much attention as a waiter would have. We ordered the house salad, which lacked in dressing big time, although knowing Italians and Italy that is how salads are served there. For dinner that night we ordered the Lasagna and the Gnocchi again. Both were EXCELENT. The Lasagna reminded us of Lasagna we ordered in Venice and drooled over. It was to die for. As an Italian and a cook, I was impressed. The gnocchi again was very good and impressive, if not extremely rich. The bartender seemed to have noticed his lack of attention towards us and asked us if we wanted dessert. We declined, but a few minutes later, he had a huge plate of tiramisu for us. It was good, for had a nice espresso flavor, thick cream and good chocolate powder on top. No charge for dessert. The next time we went was about a week later, we remembered our yummy entrees from before this time. This time we were seated immediately, even though it was crowded, we had a very nice waiter, though he forgot a few things, and plenty of really good bread. This time we ordered some penne with sausage and mushrooms with a light cream sauce and the simple pasta with pomodoro and meatballs. All very tasty and we were very pleased with our experience there. So, out of all our experiences, I say Pasta? is coming up in the world. It’s one of the better restaurants in Davis. I will totally be going back. Users/JamieParker

20090219 17:19:43 nbsp I went to Pasta? for lunch today, and I was quite impressed. I have always considered in that tier of Davis restaurants, like Bistro 33, which are quite trendy, rather expensive, and not totally worth the money. However, Pasta? is an exception to that: for $9 (not as cheap as my usual restaurants, but definitely doable even on a student budget) I got the best plate of gnocchi Ive ever had, which isnt saying all that much because I dont eat Italian that often, but it was definitely quite tasty and VERY filling, especially since I indulged in a good deal of the free bread with olive oil and vinegar they have out at lunch. Very tasty, and I wont need dinner until much later tonight.Users/StephenHudson

20090220 01:25:17 nbsp absolute awesome place, great place to take someone, the atmosphere is perfect and the staff is very friendly.  the food is great although pricey, but you cant go cheap right? Users/alexdavis

20090228 14:45:12 nbsp Ive never had lunch or dinner here, bu as fas as after hours, Pasta Q is managed by and employed with some of the most unfriendly people in the Davis nightlife industry.  They never extend any sort of courtesy.  They charge anyone who isnt a UCD student three dollars to get in even if its 5 minutes till last call, and then its damn near impossible to get a drink at their miniscule bar.  Theyve kicked out my friend as he is ordering a $50 round.   A bouncer called my friends girlfriend fat and basically tried to start a fight with our group.  Every time I ask a bouncer to let me in real quick through the back, they look at me like I am a criminal and insist I walk around and get in line.  If youre a townie like me, boycott this place for their ridiculous cover charge for nonstudents.  If you like the upscaleness try Bistro or Sophias, if you like hiphop, dance music, or dancing, try Little Prague, and if you like a large crowd of ciggarette smokers go to G street, if you like a crowd of predominantly students, go to Froggies. But if you like asshole roidmonkey bouncers and bartenders who pour like Mormons minus the smile, go to Pasta.  Users/GreezySweezy

20090308 21:28:22 nbsp In response to GreezySweezy:

The $3 cover charge applies every night, however you receive a $3 discount if you present your student ID. Allowing more people to enter for free a mere 5 minutes before last call is counterproductive because those who enter will want to spend extra time drinking the beverage(s) they ordered at the last minute, thus preventing the staff from emptying the bar and cleaning everything in a timely manner. The bar actually loses money by allowing this to happen because it has to pay its employees to stay longer, negating the profit that would be made off of your drink.

As far as entering real quick through the back is concerned, do you have any idea how many people attempt to avoid the line and cover by getting a friend or just going in for a second? It makes far more sense for the bouncing staff to prevent those who do not have hand stamps already from doing so. Otherwise one of them would have escort the individual to make certain they do return promptly, thus leaving the entrance which he is being paid to secure.

I was not present, nor do I know the details about your friend being kicked out while ordering, but the chances are he was behaving in a belligerent manner. The staff would not attempt to get rid of a paying patron for no reason. The fact of the matter is that the bar staff attempts to help customers in order in as timely a manner as possible, and the bouncer are there to escort out those who are a danger to themselves or others.

The bottom line is that there are established policies and a primary entrance for a reason. Contrary to your apparent belief, you are not better than everyone else who frequents the establishment, and you deserve no special benefits. If you visit the bar in the future, or any bar for that matter, you will find that your experience will be exponentially better if you leave your superiority complex at home. Users/5thyear

20090315 22:14:01 nbsp Had dinner here and the food was mediocre.  I had the fetuccini with salmon and it wasnt good.  It tasted weird.  My boyfriend had some sort of rigatoni and it tasted like I couldve made it at home.  Not worth it.  The good things were: the service, food came out quick, and there was unlimited bread.  Users/renee415

20090404 09:10:34 nbsp Ive never eaten here, but for going out at night this place is awful. The staff are some of the rudest people Ive ever come across at any establishment in Davis. They have a ridiculous $3 cover charge, but thats not what angers me. Apparently at a certain point that is well before 2am closing time if you step outside of their establishment you wont be allowed back in, even with a handstamp showing that you paid to get in. Im not talking five minutes before 2am, this was easily more than half an hour before last call when they wouldnt let us back in. Of course they dont let you know that on your way out. Its just when youre trying to get into the still open establishment that they arbitrarily inform you that you will not be allowed back in, despite having paid to get in and having the requisite stamp to show it. Oh, and the bouncers love to talk tough to women and threatened my 50 friend.  If you want to get treated like crap and get ripped off, then this is your place.   Users/Verwoerd

20090531 05:15:55 nbsp Ive been here a couple times, though not recently. It has a very posh, but laidback feel to it. Suited me nicely. The food was tasty, a step up from most of the Italian chains around, though you do pay for the difference. The cream sauce was delicious, as rich and, well, creamy as one would expect it to be. Thats the main thing that stuck in my mind. Overall, just a great place for a night out, especially with a small group or just two. Ill have to go again soon so I can give more specifics.

20090621 02:35:39 nbsp Pasta Q deleted my comment about how they like to kick people out and force them to drink their booze before its closing time.

Users/MyNameDoesntMatter
  Actually, Users/NickSchmalenberger, who has no association with Pasta? as far as I know, deleted it. This was probably because it sounded like a drunken rant that didnt really do much beyond insult the bouncers. However, if youd like to explain what happened, then that would probably better get across the point you are trying to make. Oh, also: if youre only going to be here for the one comment about the bouncers, then a name like mynamedoesntmatter is basically going to tag your review as being written by someone who either didnt care enough to be a regular editor on the wiki, or wasnt willing to stand behind their words with their real name.Users/JoePomidor

20090708 20:50:25 nbsp Yeah, I chose this name because I purposely created it to review Pasta Q. The food is usually pretty sub par. But believe me, what I experienced that night was lame. I know it sucks to work until closing time when there is no business. But to be so rude to customers, and deny them the simple pleasure of sitting down and enjoying a drink they just bought not 10 min before that. And to have a bouncer tell you that they close at a specific time, but essentially tough luck, get the f out in 10 min, that is lame. If you wanted to go home earlier, you shouldnt have chosen a job that requires late working hours whilst you do almost nothing the whole time except for chat with your friends and check ids. Oh yeah, and my name really doesnt matter on here. Users/MyNameDoesntMatter

20090725 16:14:05 nbsp overpriced for their portions... imagine a plate with a diameter of a foot, then imagine one layer (and yes, i mean one layer)in the middle of the plate with a diameter of no more than 5 inches of pasta and cheese sauce and baconbits... this entre was close to $10 (you were better off just making your own kraft mac and cheese or buying frozen) and then in the ravioli entre, there was a count of only 7, for the price of $13$14 (you were better off going to olive garden) anyway this place has the worst food and the worst pricing..it isnt worth it at all..along with everything else in downtown davis its OVERPRICED mixed in with a HUGE LACK in quality...

20090915 12:40:12 nbsp I dont like their policy on birthday cakes.  Ive got a friend with a gluten allergy so I made her a special cake from nut flour for her birthday.  Initially we were going to have a big dinner here but then I was told they charge a cake cutting fee if you bring one from home (even if you cut it yourselves).  Their rationale is that they lose money they would otherwise make on the dessert menu.  Yuck.  I changed the reservations to Fuzios instead because they dont charge and even kept the cake in their fridge for us until it was time to surprise her.

Too bad they cant think through the cake policy and realize that instead of losing money on desserts (none of us would have ordered anyway) they end up losing out on an even bigger dinner reservation.  It was a 21st celebration with 12 people so at least $100 was spent on drinks alone. Users/OliviaY

I ordered spaghetti carbonara and it was pretty good.  I am not one to judge what is authentic and what Pasta should taste like, but it tasted pretty good to me.  I was, however, extremely disappointed at the serving size.  It was amusing for me to watch each of my housemates faces in shock as they stared at their 15 (after the 18% mandatory party tip of course) dollar plate of pasta, which consisted of possibly 67 bites, placed in front of them by the waiter.
