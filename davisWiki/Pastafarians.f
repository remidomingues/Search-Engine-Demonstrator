   Have you been touched by his noodly appendages?

Pastafarians are members of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, a group that satirizes creation science and intelligent design through the claim that the Flying Spaghetti Monster (FSM) created the cows universe.  Although it sounds like a 5505 Discordian Convergence spoof religion (and can be argued that the cult of personality that has developed along side it is), the actual group is quite serious: they organized as a response to the idea that nonscientific theories should be forced to be taught alongside scientific theories in science classes in schools high school.  They have correlation and negative proof theories that show that the Flying Spaghetti Monster makes as much sense as any other anthropogenic creation mythos, and formally submitted to the Essence of Davis Kansas Board of Education that their theories should be taught in science classes alongside other creation mythos.  Many Pastafarians are actually Agnostic and Atheist Student Association agnostics or atheists, although one need not be an agnostic or an atheist to support Pastafarian goals, since many theists do not think that creation science or intelligent design ought to be taught in public school science classrooms, either.

Did Davis High School add Intelligent Design to their science classes?  No... but the cult of personality around the goofy image of the FSM inspired people to engage in iconifying His Divine Form into Tshirts and bumperstickers that can probably be spotted around Davis (and Adventures outside of Davis around the world).  Alas, the trees pointed stick jabbed into the eye of bureaucratic educators who wish to fiddle with classes they should probably take is lacking in most of the spinoff fans.  Thats probably a good thing  it means that science classes are generally focused on... well... actual science.

More serious Davis Pastafarians are concerned with the nationwide attempts to have religious beliefs inserted into public school science curricula.  They also encourage you to do your part to Piracy fight global warming!
