20110314 15:48:32 nbsp meggo, this place is pretty good if youre looking for something basic. 2 rooms, a living room and a kitchen. nothing fancy or pretty. our heater/AC doesnt work but thats not a big deal for us and may be our apartment only. the landlord is okay. we pay her and leave it at that :P. not much counter space.
