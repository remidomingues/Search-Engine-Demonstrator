Patrick Baxter Dragon was born in Northampton, MA on August 25, 1983.  He currently has two Bachelors degrees from UMASS/Amherst, in three majors:  Mathematics, Physics, and Astrophysics.  Dont ask how theyre divided  even the registrar cant seem to figure that one out.

Patricks father, George Dragon, was born in Morristown, NJ.  George has resided almost all his life in the Pioneer Valley, mostly between Northampton and Hadley.  George works at UMASS as a HVAC Technical Specialist.  He does an engineers work for half the pay.

Patricks mother, Jean Baxter, was born in Hartford, CT (I think).  Jean spent the plurality of her childhood growing up in Manchester, CT and has resided in the happy valley for almost 30 years.  She has a Bachelors degree from Cornell in Art History.  She is now a Production Manager for Five College Dance, Inc.  She teaches people how to lead.

Patricks sister, Emma Dragon, was also born in Northampton.  She has an Associates degree in psychology from Holyoke Community College and is currently attending nursing school.  Emma currently lives in Manchester, CT with her fiance, Dave.  Dave is studying to work as a paramedic.

Patricks humble narrator is, of course...Patrick!  So Ill continue in first person.  People call me Pat, or Pat Dragon (for effect).  Im good at math.  I like rock climbing, Hiking and Backpacking hiking, Paddling canoeing, swimming, martial arts, gardening, gaming, school, and cuddling.  Ive studied many forms of martial arts and dance, including wiki:Wikipedia:Baguazhang, wiki:wikipedia:Taekwondo Tae Kwon Do, and a little wiki:wikipedia:Capoeira.  Ive taken several modern dance courses at UMASS, and have performed in an undergraduate dance thesis and a faculty dance piece.  Ive also taken a wide variety of classes, including Drugs and Society, Quantum Mechanics, and five courses in wiki:wikipedia:German_language German.  I enjoy studying language, physical, visual, and written art, and anything else that tickles my brain.

Im really excited to be starting Grad Students graduate school here in Davis, fall 2006.  Its scary and new, but really like a big Northampton.  I expect the heat may kill me.  If it doesnt, I hope to leave Davis after Im done with (at least one of) my PhD work(s).  If I can work out the monetary hurdles, Id like to set up a sustainable farmstead back in the happy valley which I call home.  Right now (summer, 2006), Ive got almost a quarteracre of vegetables that the philanthropist Dennis Pipczynski is letting me use, free of charge!  Its wonderfully rewarding work.

6 Months Later...

The heat hasnt killed me yet!  Ive survived my first quarter of gradschool and passed my Prelims!  I miss home a lot...  But the Math dept. here is really tight, what with games night, trivia night, analysis parties, and the like.  Its going to be a good halfdecade or so.
