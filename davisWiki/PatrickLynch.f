Users/PatrickLynch Patrick Lynch recently moved to http://www.city.davis.ca.us Davis from http://in.gov Indiana to flee all the horrible wiki:WikiPedia:Tornadoes tornados.  I did much research and it seems that as long as you vote correctly nothing bad ever happens to the residents of http://www.city.davis.ca.us Davis.

I live in South Davis and have only been here a couple of months.  I like what I see so far, although living in a such a small town is a big change.  I have been frequenting the pool room at the G Street Pub quite often.  If you see my riding my bicycles bike try not to run me over.  I have taken a few trips to Lake Berryessa a couple times and its awesome.  Drop me a line if you want to join me some time.
