Talk pages are for discussing the content of a page without cluttering the page. They are also often used to resolve edit wars and controversy. For example, if one would like to make changes to the Explore section on the front page, they typical accepted way of going about this is to discuss the change on Explore/Talk to judge community response before going ahead and changing this heavily used, highvisibility page.
