20071102 22:16:47 nbsp The woman at the counter (I wish I knew her name) was so pleasant and efficient!  The repair work I had done was of excellent quality.  I definitely recommend this place! Users/incognitoTA

20080203 14:01:31 nbsp The woman is very pleasant and nice! I got my pants hemmed for $10.  At first I thought this was an average price, but then I got my pants back hemmed AND pressed.  Great place. Users/Tony1

20080715 11:49:38 nbsp Decent prices.  Good service.  Just what I was looking for. Users/slt

20081210 10:25:46 nbsp WARNING!!!  This dry cleaner destroyed a perfectly good $90 rug and refuses to do anything about it.  They even refuse to refund the cost of cleaning (destroying) the rug.  When I took the rug in I asked specifically if they could clean that particular chenille rug.  After looking at the rug they said no problem.  When I got it back it had large holes in it and loose fabric everywhere.  When I contacted the owner he was very rude and claimed they are not at all responsible for any damage.  The rug was in perfectly good condition when I took it in and I had never seen it lose a single fiber.  It is now completely destroyed... and I got to pay $22 to have someone else destroy it!

20090320 10:22:04 nbsp I have a strong recommendation for this place.
The story: I dropped off about 8 garments, and one pair of pants came back bleached (a few inches of stain on the crotch).  I was _very_ upset, and left them with Eunice, the nice Asian woman who runs the place.  I came back today, 23 days later, ready to fight, beg, plead, cry, whatever, to try to get the money back for the price of the pants (~100 bucks).  Hanging on the rack was a _new_ pair of the same pants as well as my old ones.  She tracked down the exact same pair, somehow.  She even fitted me and hemmed them.  Now, it is unfortunate that the old ones were stained, but this place got a customer for life when they made a mistake and then took care of me so well.

Eunice, the woman who works there, said she paid for them with her own money.  Ive read (here) that the actual owner isnt so easy to deal with. But as long as you inspect your garments with Eunice going in, I feel there is little to no danger.  Basically, even though there was a problem here, I feel _any_ dry cleaners will eventually ruin something.  Its how they deal with it thats really important.  Go here  support honest Davis business!

(Prices are reasonable.  Getting 89 things including a suit, 4 pair pants, 45 shirts was almost 40 bucks. I asked my dad, and its about right for quick, quality service.) Users/ErikMadden

20091002 15:56:46 nbsp Based on Eriks bleached pants and my completely destroyed rug... you have been warned. Users/weschrist

20091116 15:15:34 nbsp Decent experience but some info on the top of the page is incorrect.  To launder mens shirts is $1.75, not $1, they charge double that, $3.50 for womens shirts, even if they are an XL or XXL (which is no different than a mans shirt but the claim is that it doesnt fit on the machine right), I did have to pay an additional $1.50 to have a small hole in the interior pocket sewn (they do not do it at no extra charge as it indicates above).  The work was fine, but I had to pay $10 to have a button put on jeans.  I thought that was steep but I really like the jeans so I went ahead and had it done.  I do like that they provide what the charges will be ahead of time.    Users/Common.Sense69

20091130 15:14:37 nbsp Based on the positive reviews, brought in a suit to have it cleaned. The no fuss, no hassles, a fair price, and the nice hanger Id accidentally left there was still waiting for me when I came in a week after Id picked the suit up. Users/KevinChin

20120128 13:26:14 nbsp Customer service is mediocre. I dont like the fact that they ship everything to Sacramento and back to wash it. From now on Im going to a Davis business. Users/JohnDrips

20120812 19:22:18 nbsp I went by yesterday morning and they are no longer in business.  They had a sign in the window mentioning the two Executive Cleaners locations. Users/BigGuy
