I agree, its not the way I heard it either. Either one of the admins of the Friends group is being funny, or the groups name really is changed for an actual ticket. Users/BrentLaabs

20060113 15:24:59   Hello there, dude from the floor above the convent. My RA says were not allowed to be called the nunnery (she went to Catholic school and had horrible memories). I suggested calling us the Moulin Rouge instead. Users/KarinaSummers

20060121 17:12:09   If it makes you feel any better, interfloor socialization seems to be a rarity. Even in a building as small as Rienda the 1st and 3rd floors have little to no contact with each other, as everything their denizens require bathroom/laundrywise is on the 2nd or their own floors. Based upon the same rule, only 1/2 of the 2nd floorites here travel to the other floors, with that group getting split in one half to each. I imagine something like the same principal goes on at Ryerson?

The situations even worse in buildings that have suite bathrooms. That brings socialization down to only those within ones suite. Users/JosephBleckman

20060201 11:26:38   thanks for the edit, I do not know all the cool tricks to wiki. —MichaelMolnar

20060204 13:34:05   I heart Paul —JulieHooper

20060204 20:20:19   Probably the only freshmen in recent memory to have read the ASUCD Constituion, Government Codes and Budget his first quarter here..... —JimSchwab

20060310 02:25:49   Youre on media board? make sure they know about our Cal Aggie opinion, Im not sure it filtered down to them —KrisFricke

I didnt know that you were working on a Unit Director manual. Want to work up a personnel policy bit with me? —BrentLaabs

20060319 22:37:47   Awesome job digging up asucd historical material — keep it up! —PhilipNeustrom 20060408 16:24:52

20060502 12:21:47   FOSL ROFL —KrisFricke

20060503 02:42:45   I guess that the big new thing is creating your own ASUCD Slate. First the Christian Slate, and now FOSL (Though Im only betting on one of those two getting off the ground). Where will it end? —MaxMikalonis

20060505 00:47:48   Right now Im taking 19 units, which includes 6 hours of chemistry labs and an uncurved biology class. If you add in the time I contribute to DCD and RSS, without any time for CalPIRG, I really dont have room to be involved with IAC. However, my pass time for the fall is May 15th, and with my plans, I may be able to find some time then. —MaxMikalonis

20060505 09:43:55   FOSL.....Uh, Im in. —JillWeinstein

20060507 21:26:50   Cmon man. Slates are for elections and for voting blocks/ action taken by the elected officials. you cant put on a asucd senate page something about a slate that has never run an election and doesnt include any voting members of the senate. im with ya on the joke but the wikis for the average joe who wants to learn about a particular thing saying FOSL is a slate would give people the wrong impression. you dont see me adding RASCALL up there and not having any senators to color the corresponding color. Chairs are important but hired to do a job and probably shouldnt even be colored in anyway. —ThomasLloyd

20060507 21:33:28   Nonetheless, if this is what he wishes to identify with, one cant fairly classify him as something else. —JosephBleckman

20060508 00:58:16   point taken so if he doesnt wish to be associated with a voting slate, then we can always not attribute any color. hopefully a fair enough edit that ends the revert wars. —ThomasLloyd

20060530 20:16:57   I voted today at the MU polling place and since the incumbant was running for AuditorController I wrote Paul Harms in as a writein candidate. —RobRoy

20070816 00:36:37 nbsp Oh I dont know, id be interested in hearing about any of them. Im sure that mentality will get me an earfull of stuff i wont end up joining, but i dont care. Theyre all important in their own way. So youre the ASUCD controller? I think youre one of my friends on Facebook haha. Users/MarielleBerman

20070816 00:48:02 nbsp Well I might take it slow for my first quarter and stuff, but Im interested in all the music programs, aggie pack, the ASUSD (but just because i said that doesnt mean you can convert me :D), random clubs, intramural sports, and the like. I was the Governing Board Rep. in high school so ive been in the ASB before, but im not sure if i want to do that in college. It was basically a lot of work and no recognition. Users/MarielleBerman

20070816 01:05:27 nbsp Oh really? I didnt know that actually, I thought it was mostly student government. I did already see that the Banduh dominates the bus driving jobs, which is really random but funny. When they were telling us about those jobs at orientation and saying it was good pay, I was like hey, why not?
So yeah I sent Matthew Shannon a message on facebook introducing myself, I always like meeting new people, especially if I share interests with them. Users/MarielleBerman
