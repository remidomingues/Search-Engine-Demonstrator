 The Dark Lair Of Paul Lanzi 

Right.. what better place to screw up Phils new wiki than to start with my own page?

Im a somewhat/kinda recent graduate from the Computer Science Department of the College of Letters and Science at the University of California at Davis.  I am no longer a resident, having moved to SF in August 05.  After working for a small science based startup, I now work at a major biotech company near SF.  I generally hike a lot and take photos while doing so  a hobby that has sort of morphed into more than a hobby.  I dont like seafood.

But you already knew all that.

What you dont know is that in my next life, I plan on being a wombat.

And now we dance.

Comments(Your Chance to Object) Knock yourselves out...

07/23/2004 01:19:48 AM Paul, if youd like to work on the CSS, I suggest getting the Web Developer extension for Firefox, which allows you to edit the CSS as you view it, then save and upload it.  The things we still want to finalize are the fonts and colors.  They look nice, but still the fonts are borrowed from the old theme, and if theres something better wed like to see it.  You can also edit the formbutton style, which will be applied to all the buttons(right now its applied only to the buttons on the edit page.)  That extension makes it very easy to edit stuff and see how it looks immediately.  Users/MikeIvanov

07/28/2004 12:29:58 AM Yep.  Have had the Web Developer extension installed for some time.  It certainly rocks!  Im going to brainstorm on some color schemes soon and run them by you guys.  Users/PaulLanzi

20040728 01:21:29 nbsp That would be very cool.  I have made the logo transparent, so you can actually change the banner colors to be something offblack.  Also, Philip did an awesome job on the Comments macro, and if you want to put Your chance to object in there, you can use Comments(Your chance to object).  Events Board and a new Davis Map are in the works!  Users/MikeIvanov

20041021 23:22:14 nbsp What symbols do we need to add to the allowed symbols list?  There are a couple that would cause trouble, and I need to check to see which they are. .   Users/PhilipNeustrom

20041021 23:30:25 nbsp probably need both ? and an apostrophe... but it occurs to me that those might be the precise symbols that would cause problems...  Users/PaulLanzi

20041027 01:23:13 nbsp Hey Paul, to add points you go into Edit for the page.  Theres an Edit Map button.  Its all documented in Davis Wiki Guide.  Users/PhilipNeustrom

20041027 01:55:53 nbsp (Was it unclear in the guide or did you not reread it?  Is the Edit area the wrong area for that?)  Users/PhilipNeustrom
