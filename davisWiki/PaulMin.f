Hello! My name is Paul Min and I am running for ASUCD Senate. I am currently a second year Philosophy major, a member of Mustard Seed Ministry, and a Resident Advisor. I love UC Davis and I believe ASUCD should play a meaningful role in the life of every student. I am running for ASUCD Senate because I want YOUR VOICE to be heard in ASUCD. I want ASUCD to fight for what YOU, the students, value.

I am honored to have the opportunity of being one of your senators. If elected, I promise to give my utmost towards making your experience here at UC Davis great and safe!
Platforms Goals

Fiat Lux (Let There Be Light): I believe students have the right to be safe and feel safe while on campus at night. If you’ve ever walked, biked, or boarded across campus at night you might notice that some areas are poorly lit or even worse, completely dark. This is a safety hazard and it is unacceptable. I believe your safety is important! I want to see ecofriendly, highly efficient, led lights installed in the darkest areas of campus. To do that, I hope to work with Power and Lights director Damon Williams, Campus Planning, and University Affairs to implement an ecofriendly plan to end darkness on our campus.

Better Roads: Davis is the bicycle capital of the United States. Students bike or board around campus each day. For the most part, our roads are great and I believe “Grounds” has done a great job, but there are some roads that are poorly maintained. These roads are littered with dangerous potholes, wide cracks, and unexpected bumps. Poorly maintained roads take a toll on students’ bicycles and boards, but more importantly it is a safety hazard. I want to see the most serious road damage addressed in a timely and consistent manner. To do this, I plan to work closely with “Grounds” to ensure that our roads are safe.

Unite for Justice: There are more than 45 Christian organizations and interfaith organizations on campus, but there is no space to come together to fight for social justice. We may have our differences, but I know that everyone shares a heart for justice, such as reducing poverty and crime. I hope to bridge the Christian and interfaith community to work together on social justice issues that are relevant to students, such as increasing support and awareness for the ASUCD Pantry. Additionally, I will leverage resources to reach out to communities and bring awareness about social justice through working together on events and conferences to establish unity and clear up misconceptions.
