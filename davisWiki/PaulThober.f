20110226 16:31:10 nbsp I think I know who that lost dog belongs to! I got an email through Nancys obedience class Yahoo Group about a lost, brown colored miniature poodle that escaped the groomers shop. I called them and left them the number that was left on the page for the poodle. Heres the email I got on Friday:

Yesterday afternoon (in the midst of the downpoor), a female brown toy poodle escaped from the groomers shop. She was last seen near the softball diamond at Fst and Covell and her home is out toward Patwin Rd., off Russell.  Her name is Coco, she is very shy.  We hope she is bedraggled and cold enough to seek humans for comfort.  She is not wearing her collar.  If you see or can get a hold of her, please call 5307126104 or 5307564400.

Thanks
Tracey

I called both numbers, left a message on the first with the wiki contact number, and talked to a person at the second number who will give that same number a call. I hope this is the same dog! Users/ChristyMarsden
