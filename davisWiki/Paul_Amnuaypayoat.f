Paul Amnuaypayoat finished his coursework at UC Davis in December of 2004 and was a campaign advisor of the Friends Urging Campus Kindness Slate slate for the Winter 2005 ASUCD Election at UC Davis. He ran for ASUCD Senate as an independent candidate in Winter of 2003, the last election before Choice Voting was adopted, but did not win.

Paul was a supporter of implementing the Countback system of filling vacancies in the ASUCD ASUCD Senate Senate. Additionally, he attempted to solve the issue of ASUCD Open Government in Spring 2003 by writing legislation to put important documents onto the http://asucd.ucdavis.edu ASUCD web site, but unfortunately ASUCD Open Government recent discoveries have warranted additional efforts by concerned citizens today.

He was Employment employed full time at a credit card terminal deployment company in Sacramento from 2005 through August of 2007 and was involved with the Davis College Libertarians, Model United Nations at UC Davis Model UN, and Agnostic and Atheist Student Association AGASA, though he has not admitted to any official connection to the Campus Crusade for Chaos and Confusion. His residence in Davis spanned from late 1998 through August of 2007. Since then he has moved to wiki:wikipedia:New York City New York City where he completed his wiki:MBA MBA degree, and continues to edit various wiki:wikispot wikis from time to time.

He was known as LibPaul by the Students for an Orwellian Society Orwellian faction, but this was mainly to differentiate him from Users/PaulCernea MathPaul.



20050515 09:36:22 nbsp Paul, I was shown the minutes of a past ASUCD senate meeting (I think from last month) where you said that you thought I would be ASUCD Senate material. Im flattered by that statement from you. Things didnt really pan out that way while I was in Davis i guess. My heart was more into DCR than ASUCD. I think it would just be bizzare if I ever ran. I mentally see myself more behind the scenes.  Users/GeorgejAndrews
  Being material for ASUCD Senate is a compliment?  But seriously, I agree with where youre coming from because I find myself in a similar situation.  You would be just an ordinary political candidate, but you are a superb advisor.  Users/BrentLaabs
  During that discussion that you saw, I had to hypothetically find 4 people to represent everyone for the government, and I figured in terms of representing conservatives, you would have been the most agreed upon by nearly everyone, assuming I actually had the power to appoint.

20060503 16:21:03 nbsp Hi Paul, Steve Ostrowski says that you are a member of Christian Slate ChristianSlate, which doesnt seem likely. Im guessing that you are on their mailing list, is that the case? It seems that Steve Ostrowski is declaring people to be members when they are only on their mailing list. Users/KarlMogel

20060506 21:35:12 nbsp If you were referring to Chad and Marie, haha, I definitely have met them...but at the beginning of the school year.  I actually saw you once, actually, at Chads recent court case, I was sitting with Jon Leathers. Users/AlyssaOlenberg

20071120 21:20:39 nbsp Hey, out of curiosity, was there a reason you created a top level redirect for Users/TimCoady? Users/JabberWokky

20071120 22:53:03 nbsp Yeah, if there are links there, then the redirect should exist.  I figured it was that. Users/JabberWokky

20071121 09:12:57 nbsp If it makes any difference, I saw your edits and even skimmed over them as being correct.  The dead links are a joke.  Sort of like a link going nowhere is selfreferential humor.  I believe that most if not all of the gag links are in user entries and comments.  Another example would be me referencing selling tickets to the Memorial Union Rooftop Pool, a la the location that does not exist (a classic http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid20071001202237AAVOYCG#NbUvWDG4UjGvbo2yJZso academic prank appearing in common lore and on wiki:wikipedia:Hackers (film) film).  If there was an evolution discussion, you might refer to the missing link.  Its a minor, silly, dumb joke, but it is pretty much confined to comments and user entries.  Its also obscure enough that not getting it isnt exactly uncommon, and youre hardly the first one to try and correct it.  Theres a http://daviswiki.org/ASUCD_Gulag?actioninfo long history of it, as a matter of fact. Users/JabberWokky

20071121 22:26:41 nbsp The ASUCD Gulag page is my favourite thing on the dwiki!  Or rather, my favourite thing NOT on it!  (  I believe very strongly in it both being here via links, and it NOT being here as a page. Users/KrisFricke

20071124 07:47:10 nbsp Thanks for trying to reach out to Eric.  I know diddly squat about ASUCD politics, so I can only talk in the larger issues... which is why Ive been trying to urge him to create a talk page so the specifics can be hashed out. Users/JabberWokky

20071125 15:40:41 nbsp yo!!! what do you think about ron paul? theres a small but strong support group for him here in davis. jealous youre in ny Users/JessicaRockwell

20071201 08:41:33 nbsp Davis Wiki and Chico Wiki are separate projects with separate norms and standards. It doesnt hurt to have our own version of the page, especially if we link to their version. We wouldnt want to redirect Valero to Wikipedia, would we? Its really irrelevant that they copied our version of the page and havent made it their own yet. They will be different eventually. Our version of the page will stick to whats relevant to Davisites (that theyre a school to the north of us and theyre infamous for partying) and theirs will hopefully look kinda like our UC Davis page. Users/WilliamLewis

20071201 10:55:51 nbsp As an example, the Sacramento News & Review entry for SacWiki would focus on local coverage, while the Davis entry would list local pick up places (not of interest to readers of the SacWiki) and links to articles of Davis interest.  The same subject (even when it is in a given location) can have different perspectives by different locations.  Different wikis also have different editorial policies... some dont allow reviews or commentary at all, and the admins are quick to ban anybody who adds an opinion to an entry.  Each is a distinct community... kind of like the communities they represent.

As for this particular case, it is likely useful to have the UC System as a thumbnail here with information relevant to people in Davis, while in Chico, the entry is much more in depth and they have a thumbnail of UC Davis with information relevant to people in Chico. Users/JabberWokky

20071207 08:36:29 nbsp Its not like Brent made all this stuff up like Friedman is doing with his allegations. I got plenty of calls and messages about the allegations from different people regarding them. Brent posted what people were talking about. Most of those allegations were substantiated by at least one other post, or even substantiated by GO itself as they tried to explain what really happened.

I was there in Fall 2004 and managed or advised campaigns up until last winter. This Fall GO ran the shadiest, dirtiest election in my 3 years at UCD. Even some of the older ASUCD folks agree that Student Focus was never this shady. Theres a reason that many of the usually neutral folks in ASUCD, like Brent, are against GO.

On a side note, one reason I believe that this election is a little more intense on the wiki, is because the Aggie has decided not to cover ASUCD beyond the Senate briefs every Monday. They do not investigate any of the allegations, although oddly enough they do seem to acknowledge them in a vague OpEd they wrote after the election. They wont even print letters to the editor from any side about any ASUCD political issue. Users/JamesSchwab

20071207 16:46:04 nbsp You know Brent, just as the South Parkesque pic on his page says, he likes to shake things up. Hes not Jabberwokky hes Brent. Expecting a certain behavior from someone is not that persons fault, you just had wrong expectations. For all his controversy Brent has remained Brent  take that as you will for good or bad. Brent is very active on campus and expecting someone as passionate as he is to remain neutral, is a bad expectation.

I was not expecting Brents posts to be without criticism. But to say that since Brent is posting all the complaints, that all these complaints originated from Brent and Brent only. My point was that his allegations were allegations talked about by a lot of different people, who are not active wiki editors. Brent and Friedman have their battles, but you have to distinguish between there personal attacks and the real incidents that happened and have been confirmed from multiple sources.

That said, it is good to have an editor like yourself that does care about and knows the history of ASUCD, but can play a neutral role. And trust me if you were still a student and active in ASUCD, you would be posting here....its 2004 all over again. Users/JamesSchwab

20071207 17:03:53 nbsp Paul in response to your thoughts on LEADs philosophy I have to take some contention since I was very active in its development over the past 3 years. LEAD has people from many communities: varying economic bakcgrounds, and varying political beliefs. We have Socialists, Dems, Republicans, and declinetostates. Diversity is a mix of culture, religion, economic class, sexuality and political beliefs and LEAD runs the gamut of them all. The UCD campus is split into these communities, be it ethnic, religious, political, by major, sexuality, or even sports. LEAD has worked to bring these different communities together to better understand each other and to work on common goals as well as support invidiual community goals. Its never perfect, but I think weve done a pretty good job. Things have changed since your graduation. Users/JamesSchwab

20071208 13:11:43 nbsp Its pretty clear from your edits that you are a GO sympathizer. Users/BrentLaabs

20071208 18:23:03 nbsp what problems do you have with GO? Users/EricFriedman

20071210 14:18:49 nbsp You kick ass, I love you for being nonpartisan, and thank you for being the only logical asset to DWiki and ASUCD.  Users/EmilyTung

20080528 04:23:10 nbsp All posts by AnonAggie came from the IP address 128.32.58.99 which is http://whois.domaintools.com/128.32.58.99 registered to the UC Berkeley campus. A reverse DNS lookup on that IP address gives us a hostname of barilsmac.Journalism.Berkeley.EDU., which is a machine in one of Berkeleys http://journalism.berkeley.edu/resources/facilities.html restricted access computer labs used by the graduate program in journalism. According to Aggie staffers, Talia had few allies in her dispute at the Aggie, which alone implicates a short list of people including herself and Peter. It is public knowledge that Talia was attending Berkeleys graduate journalism program at the time. Aggie staffers state that she was the only Aggie alumni attending Berkeleys journalism graduate school when the posts in question were made.

There is no need to clutter up the article with where this assertion came from. This is what we call beyond a reasonable doubt.
