20071010 22:28:22 nbsp Dr. Johnson used to be my dentist until he moved his practice.  He is one of the best DDS Ive seen.  If you have any fear of dentistry, hes the guy.  I was very sad to see him leave his practice in Dixon.    R. Daniels Users/Rjdaniels

20071127 14:29:34 nbsp Ive been seeing Dr. Jones for a while now and hes an excellent dentist.  Highly recommended! Users/BrianGingold

20080106 13:25:15 nbsp I just want to add some praise for Dr Jones to Brian Gingolds.  I moved to Davis a couple of years ago and had the standard set of teeth Xrays one gets when starting at a new dentist.  From these Xrays Dr Jones recognized that I had an infection as a result of a root canal that was done poorly many years ago.  My immune system had the infection under control but it was slowly reducing the bone at that point.  In time I would have got an abscess and maybe the bone would have been so bad that I would have had to have the tooth out.  Dr Jones referred me to an oral surgeon to have the infection removed.  He was very complimentary of Dr Jones for having seen something that most dentists would have missed. Users/LNewson

20080507 13:45:02 nbsp Dr. Johnson is most likely the BEST Dentist Ive ever visited. I am truly pleased with his confidence, knowledge and care. His staff are very considerate, knowledgeable and courteous, and I cant seem to think of a high enough praise for him and his lovely staff.  I had a drilling and temporary crown placed today that I almost slept through. I am very pleased to be in his care. Users/Alex

20090810 13:15:57 nbsp Went in today for a new patient exam and cleaning.  Dr. Johnson is one of the friendliest and most thorough dentists Ive had.  He and his staff make sure you leave the office feeling confident that they didnt miss anything and that you know what youre doing when it comes to your teeth.  I would definitely recommend their office. Users/Lenka

20091214 10:27:57 nbsp Best to avoid this Dentist.  My wife went to him today and although she was informed by the Dental office that the principal PPO insurance is accepted there, she was asked to pay $80 in copay just for the 18 or so X rays they took the first day of her visit.  When we called the insurance, they said that this Dentist is not even in the network.  I think the Dental office should have told my wife about the coverage and costs before the appointment.  I guess its another money grabbing venture that needs to be avoided. Users/tanurami

20091215 18:50:18 nbsp Im not so sure about the above persons complaints.  They made sure to get all of my girlfriends insurance information before the visit so they could make sure she was covered.  This seems to be more of a problem with the quality of their insurance policy?  The copay rate is set by them, and should be something that you should be made aware of (by the insurance) in much the same way that you should be aware of your car insurance deductible.   In a related vein, my girlfriend greatly enjoyed her dental visit.  She and I would highly endorse this DDS. Users/MasonMurray

20110105 08:35:36 nbsp Dare I say my visit was pleasant? It was the best dentist experience Ive ever had! Dr. Johnson was so nice, informative, throrough, and the staff was great too! I was bit nervous because I had an infant at home that would need to be fed and they accomadated me so well. Will reccomend this practice to everyone! Users/jsbmeb

20111101 02:04:46 nbsp Does anyone know what the averages costs associated with this dentist if you have metlife dental?  Thanks! Users/maranda

20120128 12:17:55 nbsp I really liked this dental office. I was with Dr. Johnson for about a year. The combination of the changes in our insurance, which made it more expensive, and my moving to Sacramento made me opt for a local, innetwork dentist. But I had great experiences there. Leslie, the hygienist I had when I was there, was hands down the best hygienist Ive had. Were all used to the canned you need to floss more or you need to be better about flossing, but in 27 years, not one of them ever took the time like Leslie did to grab a mirror, and slowly show me exactly what she meant by that. Next time I saw her, she said, there, youve got it basically. I thought that was neat. Users/DavidBenjamin

20120410 16:16:53 nbsp Dr. Johnson is the best! Very kind and friendly. My hygenist, Lexie, is also the best. Its a pleasure to come here. Users/jsbmeb
