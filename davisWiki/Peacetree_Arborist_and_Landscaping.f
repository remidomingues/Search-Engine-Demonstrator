20120524 16:48:05 nbsp Terrible! I cant believe what just happened. Was considering irrigation system. He was here ten minutes, enough time to crack (destroy) the main water valve. Then he said This is awkward, what do you want to do? I said I felt he broke it, and he said since I was there when he did it, maybe it was my fault? Uh. Who hired who, for expertise? At that point I just wanted him off my property, I need someone honest who knows what theyre doing, to come fix the damage. Pretty sure I smelled marijuana ... too late.
Since this Wiki is where I found him, I feel obligated to document my experience.
