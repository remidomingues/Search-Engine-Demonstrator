Unfortunately, Peasant Revolt broke up in mid2006, due to being unable to find a constant drummer. However, 2 members of Peasant Revolt now play in the band Unidentified, and 2 more play in the band Shattered Landscape.....most of this band is now in Sterling Riot. Peasant Revolt was a budding young wiki:wikipedia:anarchopunk/wiki:wikipedia:grunge band. Its members were Users/TobinJones Tobin Jones, (Guitar, Vocals) Jacob Mealy, (Guitar) Users/WillJobe William Lee Jobe (Bass), and Andy Voss (Drums).  Their hits included Sweatshop Prison, Worth Fighting For,A New 85 and Say It.  They were in the process of recording their first album on tape.
