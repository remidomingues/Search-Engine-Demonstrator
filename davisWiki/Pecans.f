Pecans can be found at local produce stands and supermarkets groceries, but of course, they also are grown here in the beautiful weather of Northern California.  Tree farms can be found outskirts surrounding Davis with pecans aplenty.  So crack a shell, crunch some tasty nut meat and enjoy the natural bounty of the Sacramento Valley!
Pecan trees grow fast  5 a year or more. They need careful training for good limb spacing and to avoid bad branch angles, and the trees get very large: 40  50 or more.  Most varieties need a pollenizer (a second type nearby) for good nut production. Without a pollenizer, you tend to get a lot of blank nuts. Western Schley is selffertile. Pecan trees tend to bear heavily in alternate years, which is why they arent commonly grown as a commercial crop locally.
