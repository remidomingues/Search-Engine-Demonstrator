Pedestrian Train Track Safety is a perennial issue in Davis, given the train tracks that crisscross through town carrying rail traffic and the high amounts of pedestrian and bicycles bicycle traffic (that becomes pedestrian when somebody carries their bike over a track) in town.  It is also an issue for those responsible for the tracks, currently Union Pacific Railroad.

In late 2010 there was controversy over the proposed Olive Drive Railroad Fence and the balance of safety versus the ability to  navigating davis access Olive Drive by foot or bike.
