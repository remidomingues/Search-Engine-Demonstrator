Pedestrians are supposed to be wellrespected in Davis.  Pedestrians are given the rightofway on any public street or even private street or (unpaved) alley. Chickens, turkeys, dogs, and cats also are accorded unquestioned rightofway here.  For any cityrelated pedestrian questions or praise, pedestrians can let their fingers do the walking on over to Bicycle Advisory Commission.

When walking through the UC Davis campus or in town, be especially aware that almost no bicycling bicyclists will yield to pedestrians, even at crosswalks.  Most cars are very good about stopping and waiting, however.  Regardless, never assume that a bike or car will stop for you; always make sure that they see you before crossing.

To learn even more than you may have asked for about the walking Wonderland of Davis, check out the The Grass Sidewalk, Sidewalk Crack Project, and the greenbelts greenbelt system.

Keep in mind that if you dont notice a car, dont expect the car to notice you. It doesnt care if you go thunking off the hood. FMa ppl
