This fresh produce emporium consists of a twostory Quonset hut (with the distinctive semicircular roof, pictured above) located on the north side of the Interstate 80 freeway, at Pedrick Road.

This store is known for its fresh vegetables, but also has a large stock of bulk nuts, dried fruit, and candy all of unknown origin. As these are not local, the prices are comparable to what you will find elsewhere. Overall, prices are low presumably due to their low land costs. This market is similar to Yolo Fruit Stand

If youre an aficionado of minimally processed local food, Pedrick Produce is an interesting market at which to purchase fresh vegetables and fruits.  Youll also find a a quality selection of Hot Sauce hot sauces, a veritable cornucopia of beans, rice and other grains. Other scrumptious rural delicacies include chocolate bark homemade peanut brittle. Lots of nuts (though Davisites are rarely sighted here) of many flavors here too.  Dont forget to try the ice cream and honey. Gunthers Ice Cream Gunthers pumpkin ice cream has been spotted there.  Or, the olives.

Many items are available here in bulkpriced much lower than at the Davis Food Coop. The products have less hype and corporate baggage, and youll be supporting small businesses. They also have tons of bulk candy (the kind you normally only find in a movie theater) for a fairly reasonable price. Its origin is unknown. Their bagged tortilla chips are delicious and cheap.

Shoppers may also arrive there via County Roads back roads and on Bicycling bike.

The photographs suggest this is a lonely place. It is not. During a typical Saturday afternoon, the parking lot is full, the store is busy, and heavy farm trucks (laden with tomatoes on my September visit) go by several times a minute.

 Backroad Directions 

Useful for bikers, a nice motorcycle ride, etc.  Warning to Bicycling bicyclists: most of Pedrick Road has no shoulder, and the traffic can be heavy compared to other county roads.

  From Covell Boulevard:  Go west past Lake Blvd. until you get to the next crossroads at County Road 98.
  From Russell Boulevard:  Go west past Lake Blvd. until you get to the next crossroads at County Road 98.
  From Hutchison Drive:  Go west until the road deadends at County Road 98.

Now that youre at County Road 98, take a left (i.e., go south), and the road will turn into Pedrick Road.  As you start approaching I80, youll see the 76 and Chevron gas stations, and Pedrick is next to the Chevron.

Obviously, reverse the directions to get home.

20060913 08:40:33 nbsp Pedricks has delicious vegetable chips. Theyre awful for you, but theyre crunchy, salty, flavorful and just greasey enough.  Users/AmyGoogenspa

20070628 01:11:32 nbsp This is a great place for fruits and vegetables.  The store is oddly stocked (it seems to have several redundant sections), but everything looks good.

FYI, the no sugar added candy notes, Warning: May Act as a Laxative.  I suggest that everyone take the warning seriously.   Users/MisterProfessor
   They probably use sugar substitutes then.  Pretty much all of those sugar alcohols are mild laxatives.  (Xylitol seems to be becoming one of the most popular).

20071001 09:46:12 nbsp This is my favorite produce location so far. Most of the times I go, they have a cart outside with 1/2 price produce; I have been lucky and getting their Asian pears on 1/2 price sale.  Asian pears stay good for 6 weeks, so while the 1/2 price ones may not be the newest batch, I doubt they are 6 weeks old and they only get better with age, softening and ripening just a bit. Be sure to keep them in the fridge  cold Asian pears are extremely crisp, sweet and delicious! Users/NickStrand

20090710 12:57:35 nbsp Enormous selection of nuts! Much more to choose from than Yolo Fruit Stand.
Some bulk candy prices/lb. are higher than Yolos, depends on what you buy. They also have a good selection of sugarfree chocolate candies, if you venture a try. The fine print on the sugarfree candies warn may act as a laxative.they werent kidding! Users/ViVi

20100404 11:52:55 nbsp Vegetable Chips FTW! Users/ArianeMetz

20100531 10:24:58 nbsp Theres a hidden deal at Pedrick. The fresh herbs! For $1.59 you get California grown herbs you can plant for continuous use or just keep watered so the leaves dont wilt and use the whole plant right away. The quality is superb and the price is well below Ace, HomeDepot, or Lowes. We purchased beautiful basil in two different varieties (purple and green), thyme, marjoram, and sage. The best time to go is as soon as they are delivered to get the best quality and selection Monday and Friday evenings are when they are typically delivered. Dont blame the grower if you go and the plants are in dismal condition its the job of Pedrick to actually water the plants and make sure the soil gets wet and absorbs the water. Also note as long as there is no browning drooping plants just need some water to spring them back into life. By the way those fresh herb packets in Pedrick are $1.99 and you get less and once its gone its gone with the live plants you get have as little or as much as you want. Users/dimes

20100824 18:27:39 nbsp Great produce love it...do not use a credit card as I had identity theft each time i used a new card there.  will still go just use cash.. Users/SandyShaw
  Ive been using credit cards there for more than two decades without a single problem. Can you give us more details, and did you bring it to their attention? Users/DonShor

20100925 23:47:13 nbsp Pedrick Produce is lifechanging. Im devastated that I did not learn of this place 3 years ago when I moved to Davis instead of 3 months before I have to leave here. There are some amazing deals on fresh fruits and veggies, most of which are locally grown. Biking here from Davis is quite an adventure  a life I didnt get enough of but will miss terribly.

20110507 11:32:55 nbsp I love Pedricks.  Last summer, my wife and I were cooking 3 vegetarian dishes for 100 people for a wedding.  It was incredible just how much we managed to get at minimal cost.  The photo above shows a small purchase on 5/7/2011.  A couple pounds each of green beans, celery, fuji apples, heirloom tomatoes, and cucumbers; some zucchini, bell peppers, asparagus, and corn.  The produce ran about $12, with a bottle of Briannas blue cheese dressing and a pound of butter toffee almonds that brought the total to $21. They often dont have the selection you can find at other stores (for instance, we had to go to Nugget to get Asian pears for the wedding). They have the basics yearround for average or belowaverage prices.  Its the inseason produce that really shines. Users/TomGarberson

20110713 10:19:04 nbsp I shop at Pedricks for all of my veggies, fruit, nuts, and grains (and the occasional sweet chocolate covered treat!) Combined with shopping at Trader Joes, my grocery bill has gone down considerably. Its worth the drive out there. The produce is delicious! Users/LenaSchiffer

20110818 00:34:22 nbsp Every Sunday, I make the very short drive to get my weeks worth of produce. I am always amazed at my bounty for such little cost (as long as I can have the willpower to resist some chocolates or cookies ... damn you chocolate covered honeycomb!) This place has seriously enabled me to continue eating healthy on a recentlygraduatedandjobless income! Users/ChristyMarsden

20111112 12:40:02 nbsp Do they sell flavored honey sticks here? Users/AlexandraS
  Yes.   Users/CovertProfessor

20131126 08:45:51 nbsp I thought this comment section needed an update, Pedrick Produce is still open and stocked with a terrific assortment of fruits, veggies, grains, dried goods, salsas and more. I love shopping here. The people are friendly and the prices are so much cheaper than anything I can ever find at the big box stores. Ill be stopping in today to stock up on Thanksgiving ingredients and road trip goodies for the trip down to LA. Users/xochiotomi
