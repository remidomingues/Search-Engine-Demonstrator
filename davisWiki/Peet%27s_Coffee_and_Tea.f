Founded by wiki:wikipedia:Alfred Peet in Berkeley in 1966, Peets has branched out from its Bay Area roots and is now opening for business across California and the United States. There are two Peets in Davis: on Covell Boulevard next to Noahs Bagels. The downtown coffeeshop on E Street replaced Cafe Roma in the spring of 2007.  For some reason, there are no bathrooms available in Covell Peets.  Unfortunately, Peets is not run by http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001605/ Amanda Peet.

Peets serves excellent coffee, espresso and tea, along with pastries and a few sugary specialty drinks like flavored lattes and Freddos (blended ice drinks). If youre in search of an excellent cup of coffee, be sure to ask about the coffee of the day.  The espressobased drinks have an odd sizing; both the small size and the medium size hot drinks contain two shots of espresso, so the taste isnt constant across the sizes.

Peets also has an extensive collection of loose leaf teas. In addition to regular iced tea they also have hibiscus tea. They also have http://daviswiki.org/Peet%27s_Coffee_and_Tea Tea Freddos available in matcha green tea and chai. Mango and Berry Pomegranate are seasonally available in spring and summer.

Since summer 2008, free Wifi is provided in Peets. Once you get the access code from the cashier, you have free internet access. The logon page says that you have one hour. It used to be two hours, but Peets decided to limit it to one hour. As of January 2013, you still get two hours despite the logon message granting you one hour at the E Street Peets. The Marketplace Peets appears to actually grant only one hour, but alternative wifi is now available. As of April 22, 2013 (Earth Day), Peets no longer requires a code for internet access.

Peets Coffee was bought in 2012 by German conglomerate Joh. A. Benckiser for $977.6 million. The foreign owned company is known for beauty companies like Coty and luxury goods business Labelux. Peets is under the same umbrella as Jimmy Choo and OPI nail polish.

Ill second the statement that, if you want actual coffee, this is one of the best places to go.  If you like lightly coffee flavored milkshakes, this isnt your cup of... tea?  Speaking of which, they have Earl Grey with extra bergamot, a quite heady tea.  Users/JabberWokky

20050724 18:36:26 I go to the one in North Davis, its nice and quiet, usually a pretty steady stream of people (mostly older, nonundergradlooking types) coming for their afternoon coffee.  Their coffeebean section is quite popular.  They also seem to have at least one if not two sample pitchers of a particular tea or coffee for people to try.  If you dont specific that you want the drink for here they will give you a paperorplastic cup to take out, but you can request a real nondispoable mug.  Their cappuccino was on the wetter side, still good, but useful to know for the first time you order from them. Users/IrenePark

20051220 02:20:23 nbsp My mom went and bought a couple of coffee mugs ($5 each) from here today and they gave her coffee on the house. Im not sure I like the setup in the shop itself. The tables in the corner are kind of crunched together and make the people sitting at them look intimidating to sit next to. The coffee bar itself is rather large and makes it difficult to form a line in the proper places. Otherwise, the decorative, lighting and overall attitude of the employees were all quite pleasant.

20060113 14:28:11 nbsp Not the best place to hang out, but by far the best coffee in Davis.  If the quality of the coffee is what matters most to you, this is the place. Users/ToNils

20060118 12:40:54 nbsp Amazing coffee, tea, and the fact that they carry Scharffenberger (sp?) makes them even cooler. Horrible layout, but then again most Peets arent conducive to lingering. Users/AhuShahrabani

20060122 23:33:15 nbsp A few weeks ago, a nice Peets barista was practicing making espresso con pannas.  He gave me one, in addition to the coffee I had ordered.  Needless to say, I was mighty caffeinated for the next few hours.  A tasty beverage, espresso con panna. Users/JamesShearer

20060128 15:32:36 nbsp The best storebought espresso Ive had in Davis. The service is fantastic and the employees are nice to both customers and their kids. If only the parking lot wasnt a death trap...Users/CharanRanganath

20060206 09:59:03 nbsp  this is tha last place I will ever buy coffee in Davis again.  I like peets coffee but; the service can be totaly lame (for example: can I help you? a refill please youll have to go to the back of the line Users/RobiPochapin

20060206 10:01:26 nbsp The is the worst peets I have ever visited.  Starbucks has better service, mishkas fresher bean, and any other cafe has an accessable restroom. Users/RobiPochapin

20060226 19:43:15 nbsp I really like the coffee and being from the Bay Area its nice to find the same great cup here too. HOWEVER, for the most part, people who work here seem a little stressed out and arent as nice as SBux. Yes, I know, but its true. AND they charge you for a refill (10cents if own cup) where Sbux only charges 50cents. Also, they always seem to be out of my favorite cookies. Anyway, its ok to hang out there if you know the employees I think or if you are older. I dont think they are as nice to the students. Oh, and theres no bathroom!! Users/LookyLoo

20060319 13:38:33 nbsp They used to carry this really good biscottie called quresomalis(sp?). Too bad they discontinued it.  I love their Jasmine Lime tea that comes in the Spring Users/PattyLouieJunior

20060412 13:51:12 nbsp Actually their small and medium sized espresso drinks contain two shots of espresso. Users/EmmyMelton
  If this is true, then theyve changed their espresso drink recipes. While I still think inconsistent ratios is odd, two shots in a small might be worth getting...Users/MattCzarnowski mc

20060421 14:34:19 nbsp Peets and Mishkas house blends are neckandneck for me, but when I want a cozy atmosphere I go to the latter.  The coffee is flavorful, fresh, and strong.  Sometimes the servers are a little clueless theres this one girl who stood idle while staring at the line of customers.  (You work in a coffee joint!  Wake up and smell the coffee!) Users/JennaChan

20060506 11:18:34 nbsp Great coffee, but the refills at Belmont on El Camino are $1.40. I asked the manager twice if he was sure. Good coffee, but not worth $1.40 refills. He actually said there is only a discount because I brought my own cup. Go Starbucks $0.50 refills! Users/UmeshSf
  Free refills at Java California.  Plunk your money and study/work/hang out all evening.  Users/JabberWokky jw

20060516 09:13:02 nbsp I really like this place.  Its in a location such that the only time I ever have a chance to stop by is after Ive been grocery shopping, but the coffee is good and fresh and strong and the people that work there always seems nice enough to me.  My wife and I bought some beans to send to someone as a birthday present, and the guy who sold us the beans gave us each a free cup of coffee!  Very cool.  I wish there was one of these downtown. Users/AdamSchneider
   Peets always offers a free cup when you buy beans. I believe that dates back to when Peets was a single store in Berkeley. Best beans in Davis. Users/JimEvans

20070220 02:08:22 nbsp I especially love all the junk for sale in shelves on the wall.  Product everywhere I look, in many colors for me to choose!  That is sarcastic.  Anyway, their coffee is so strong it makes me dehydrated and my stomach churn.  I guess Ill have to get used to it. Users/JeffShaw

20070310 13:35:20 nbsp Ick... Coffee is too strong for my taste, but I know thats how a lot of people like it. To me, the coffee tastes like the bottom of a coffee pot thats been sitting for 6 hours. Nice merch, though. Real nice. Users/BriannaBetancourt

20070311 21:55:25 nbsp I just had my first Peets coffee drink (vanilla latte) from the Marketplace location, and id argue it was the best cup ive ever bought. Good, strong coffee and just the right amount of and consistency foamed milk.  Davis needs fewer Starbucks, and more Peets (Silo, anybody?). Users/LeonardMarque

20070522 12:05:53 nbsp Is there a scheduled opening date for the downtown location yet?  I generally prefer peets to the starbucks on the coffee taste, but Im also not terribly particular and will drink almost anything. Users/RocksandDirt

20070525 13:26:41 nbsp    I just called their downtown store and they said they are now open. Users/BenBackes

20070528 19:26:16 nbsp the downtown peets is the antithesis to what cafe roma roma was... Users/StevenDaubert
  Patience grasshopper...Roma was what it was due to the clientelle, not so much the store management (In my opinion).  So, let this clientelle grow on the place.   Users/rocksanddirt

20070705 19:04:24 nbsp Go for their latte. Definitely better than Starbucks (latte at Peets has a deeper taste to it). Users/at86

20071027 03:31:59 nbsp Peets has delicious coffee. I went to the Marketplace location first and thought the seating arrangement was quite strange; everyone was huddled in that tiny corner. The Downtown location has a much better set up. There was a barista who seemed a bit ticked off and on edge when I tried to order something that is apparently seasonal to spring only (but is still up on their board), but everyone else was quite nice. The Hibiscus iced tea I ordered in lieu of the seasonal item was great. Users/ScarlettYing

20071027 23:27:04 nbsp I love Peets coffee.  It is much better than Starbucks. Users/HeatherBeck

20071107 23:37:20 nbsp The E Street Peets seems to have a fly problem in warm weather, probably because the outside tables are located just a few feet away from the Chipotle Chipotle dumpster (tucked behind a door in the alleyway). I like the downtown location because it has a lot of tables and its within walking distance of the campus, but man those flies are relentless around noon. Users/robinlaughlin

20071108 17:47:45 nbsp I am glad Peets coffee is downtown. They have a great staff who is always friendly and knows every customer by name. To me that shows that they care.  I do agree that the flies do get a lil annoying but the atmosphere makes up for it... Users/AC

20071128 13:31:38 nbsp The downtown Peets is much better than what was there before.  It has a nice, soothing atmosphere and is almost perfect for studying.  Its much less chaotic than Mishkas.  I say almost because if you want to use a computer, good luck in being the one person to sit next to the one outlet in the cafe. P.S.  Why do people think that Cafe Roma had such great clientele?  I say good riddance to the riff raff that hung outside both locales in Davis...especially the pit bull toting hoodlums outside former 3rd street location....   Users/AnnieSirrah

20071218 16:03:24 nbsp Does anybody know what the deal is with the mentally disturbed homeless guy who frequents the downtown Peets? On several occasions Ive seen him have some interesting conversations with himself and scare away customers. Users/Red

20080125 07:29:15 nbsp This place is great. Classical music, quiet, and wonderful staff behind the counter. Go early to get a table! Users/jsg718

20080318 01:19:47 nbsp The downtown location strikes a nice balance between the clean, corporate ambiénce of Starbucks; and the grungy, laidback atmosphere of Mishkas.  Still, go to Mishkas if you want to give your folks the authentic Davis experience. Users/StephenUy

20080327 17:11:55 nbsp I love, love, love, Peets coffee.  It is STRONG and helps me stay focused when I have an important deadline.  I have raring ADHD and its just as effective as Ritalin or Adderall except without all the nasty side effects.  I usually go to the Peets in North Davis, but  Im happy that there is a downtown location.  Its convenient when Im in desperate need of relief. The place that was there before had strong coffee (again, just as good Ritalin), but it had the ambience of a Greyhound bus station with the same clientele.       Users/CurlyGirl26

20080621 22:51:58 nbsp Best drink of all time: Matcha Green Tea Freddo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Love Peets. Their drinks have a more natural taste than the sugarloaded Starbucks. Users/mikam

20080829 01:57:08 nbsp Im admittedly not a huge coffee drinker but the espresso at peets is really good. Unfortunately I seem to have really bad luck and about a third of the time they dont get my very uncomplicated order right (regular espresso instead of iced or regular milk instead of soy). This is particularly true of the downtown location. Users/JakeJames

20080830 07:54:50 nbsp I LOVE PEETS’ LARGE ICED WHITE MOCHA WITH NO WHIP CREAM!!!!! I DRIVE OUT OF MY WAY AND WAIT IN SOMETIME LONG LINES JUST TO HAVE THIS FIX. WAY better than anything else in Davis. Infinite better than Starbucks.

The only thing I would make better is the service. They’re too slow, especially if you go there in the afternoon.

20081117 19:01:43 nbsp Best coffe and tea, worst climate...like a refrigerator! I cannot go there anymore because of this. Users/G.L.

20090124 17:23:35 nbsp Love the E Street one  on the inside. On the outside, it smells rancid by the trees and gutter. The mix of spilled coffee, spilled chipotle, and bad drainage can make the outside untenable. Users/jsg718

20090504 17:10:18 nbsp Just wanted to add a firm thumbs up for Peets coffee over Starbucks.  House coffee here isnt 1dimensional, unlike almost all Starbucks varieties. Users/RyanMikulovsky

20090601 11:41:01 nbsp The reason Peets takes longer to make drinks is because they start from scratch.  Have you ever noticed that at starbucks, you cant make a frappuccino (blended ice drink) specialized? At Peets, you can get any milk you want, any syrup you want, and NO drink is made from a premade, standard mix.  Also, at many Starbucks (maybe not all, but MANY) use milk thats minutes old, and Peets doesnt start your drink until you order.  They dont put milk and shots under an automatic machine and walk away.  They have to watch to make sure the shot is not underpulled or overpulled, and milk is steamed to perfection.  Want quality?  Peets. Users/JesBisagno

20090612 14:31:42 nbsp good chai.  reasonably priced. Users/strawberry

20090714 20:57:33 nbsp The E Street Peets, though I miss Romas, has its charms. If you drink tea Peets has the best selection and quality. They put two bags in every cup, but if you tell them, as I always do, that you want only one bag, they will give you the second bag to take with you. I have a collection of about 20 in my computer bag.

If you plan to sit, bring a parkaeven on the hottest days, you risk hypothermia lingering too long within. Users/MichaelPlotkin

20090811 19:32:38 nbsp Peets in downtown Davis is, in my opinion, the best espresso in Davis. It is pulled properly, the beans are of high quality, and of the many dozens of drinks which I have had from Peets, only one was truly less than satisfactory. I ordered a large iced Americano, and the barista pulled the espresso too quickly, resulting in an acidic and harsh drink. However, considering that at the CoHo, Starbucks, Mishkas, and any other coffee place in Davis this sort of thing happens nearly half the time like clockwork (and 90% of the time at the CoHo espresso line), Peets has a remarkably record.

The atmosphere in Peets is always nice, the employees though can be pretty frigid if you catch them on a bad day or at a particularly busy time. Generally, though, they are polite and know how to do their jobs very well, which is the most important part of customer service. I have never had to wait unusually long for a drink at Peets, nor have I ever been dealt with truly rudely. I love Peets and have no reason to stop any time soon, despite one bad drink experience out of a great many. Users/RDRIII

20090928 22:17:00 nbsp I just went to Peets on E street for the first time since it was Espresso Roma, and it feels like theyre only using half the space. Anyone else notice this, or is it just me? Users/MikeFolf
   Totally. Many mornings when I was there, therere no place to sit, even after waiting over 15 minutes. I asked them whether theyll be putting more tables and chairs and they said theyre looking into it. Users/val

20091120 14:40:24 nbsp I love their caramel lattejust the right amount of sweetness and espresso. Though I tried the vanilla latte yesterday and strangely it tasted just like the caramel one, to me!  Users/val

20091125 12:25:57 nbsp Doesnt have great coffee, no great places to sit.  Staff is nice enough though, I have never had problems at Peets Coffee.  If you really want good coffee though, go to Noahs.  Otherwise you are just paying for PLAIN and PEDESTRIAN bean water. Users/JSlice

20091229 13:36:32 nbsp Best coffee in Davis!  Users/EmilyHughes

20100116 20:16:45 nbsp I love the atmosphere, but they desperately need to add more tables.. Users/LeeY

20100117 13:50:04 nbsp I think adding more tables would make the counter and the bathroom less wheel chair accessible. Perhaps we should all be a bit more considerate of people who have mobility restrictions; its difficult enough maneuvering through the existing tables and chairs in a wheel chair. Users/AndreaG

20100321 17:33:08 nbsp They sell highquality espresso makers by the Italian manufacturer Bialetti here. Good stuff. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bialetti Users/JoFeuerstein

20100627 21:03:27 nbsp While I really like the classical music played in the downtown location, the service can be amazingly slow.  It seems that even with four people working most of the time, they often struggle to have one at the register and one making drinks.  I dont know what the other two are doing.  Their efficiency (or lack thereof) would be an excellent project for an Industrial Engineering student looking for a project.  Mishkas (with two people) is much faster.
 Users/RMS


20100912 12:53:44 nbsp Great coffee and great service. One of the barista gave me a coupon for a free small cup of coffee after I had to wait for them to brew a new batch of coffee. I actually did not mind the wait at all so the coupon was simply overly nice. It can get real busy at peak times so be prepared to wait. Frankly, this doesnt seem unnatural for any coffee shop. Fortunately the service at Peets compensates for the sometimes slow pace. Overall, I love Peets coffee. The coffee is always bold and rich in that distinctly coffee flavor. That the service is always topnotch makes getting my morningcup all the more enjoyable.  Users/blastoff

20101106 17:06:57 nbsp We love Peets, but beware of the floor mat by the front door! It is fun to sit and watch one person after another trip on the mat. Any lawyers out there should take notethis is a lawsuit waiting to happen. Users/MichaelPlotkin

20101117 13:11:57 nbsp Excellent coffee.... brutally slow (but very friendly) service.

Attention Peets Ownership: dont change the coffee, but consider using some of the assemblyline mechanics of the evil empire (Starbucks) to speed things up a bit.   Your coffee is superb, but sometimes.........alas......I just dont have time to pace around waiting for the espresso jocks to get my order up and across the counter to me.    Users/browneyedblues

20110122 17:49:28 nbsp In response to the comments about slow service, this is often because of customers purchasing beans or merchandise  these customers take longer to ring up and there is sometimes not enough staff to open another register. Other coffee shops like Starbucks or Mishkas do not have this constant high demand for beans.  Users/Whit

20110213 11:58:43 nbsp The Peets in the Market Place (Covell location) is awesome. John, the barista at this location makes THE BEST coffees and lattes Ive ever had. He clearly loves what he does. Hes so friendly and nice, actually the entire staff staff here is friendly and easy to chat with  and they try really hard to remember your name if you come regularly. You should also sign up for Peets emails because they frequently give out Buy one Get one coupons.  Users/Bryna

20110213 12:03:02 nbsp Oh and another thing  for those of you complaining about the slow service (Ive never personally noticed and we go regularly to Peets on Covell) if you want fast coffee that compromises taste and quality then head over to Starbucks. Otherwise, so you may have to wait an extra 2 mins for your coffee.. BIG DEAL. Dont you know you cant rush perfection? Users/Bryna

20110315 14:20:19 nbsp I LOVE Peets their coffee is AMAZING! I am a bit depressed that prices go up, but oh well I guess everything gets expensive.  I think sometimes they are under staffed and under appreciated in terms of the employees, but overall I would much rather pay for a good, quality cup of coffee than anything else!  Oh yeah, and the marble bread is yum yum! Users/LindaHT

20110803 19:48:30 nbsp Im from the Bay, so I love going to Peets! I cant wait for the summer because I can order their refreshing Jasmine Lime iced tea (imagine slightly tangy, sweet goodness in a cup)! During the winter, I usually order a caramel latte. I think that their drinks are much stronger than other large competitors (namely Starbucks) and that you get more bang for your buck. The downtown location is usually filled with students studying and the North Davis location is more older familytype folks who like to sit and chat on the patio with friends and their dogs. Though atmosphere is an important feature for a coffee shop, but it all boils down to their products and I think their coffee is an amazing way to start my morning! Users/AI

20110805 17:07:12 nbsp My brother worked at one of the original Peets locations in Berkeley, circa early 90s.  Unlike Starbucks, back then they were content to be a local place, not sell and expand (as some pressured them to do with Starbucks on the rise).  They didnt want to compromise the quality of their product, which is still great, though theyve obviously expanded (locally in California anyway).  Still the nest hot chocolate in town (my opinion of course). Users/OldDavis73

20130217 19:20:11 nbsp My friend and I both applied here and they were so rude. The managers asked us to come back for interviews several times then they would call our reference who would miss the call try calling back, leave a message with someone else, and then they would never call him back.

20130928 17:44:56 nbsp While I like the downtown Peets, I have a few comments.  The first is that service is often slow.  They often have 3 or 4 people working and only one person at a register (even when there is a line).  The second is that the staff often seems more focused on their other duties then customer service (making drinks and/or working at a register).  The third is that they often shut off the music (which is disappointing because it adds to the atmosphere.)  The final is that they really need some blinds on the windows facing the alley. (On sunny days the counter is almost unusable.)  Interestingly, other Peets seem to be more efficient (for example, the store at 19th & S in Sacramento).  And, other Peets have blinds for sunny days.
 Users/RMS

20140209 14:50:48 nbsp As predicted Peets is now selling food. Troubled waters ahead. My recent gripe however, to echo RMS, is the service. In an informal survey, I have discovered my order is wrong 60% of the time lately. That is, I always ask for a for here cup and (yes, sometimes they are out of these, but...) often enough they simply forget. When I get tea, I always ask for one bag only. Often enough, I get two. service can be glacial in tempo, and while most of the baristas are friendly enough, the quality of the espresso beverages is erratic. OK, back to worrying about global warming, BisphenolA and other things that distract me from griping about Peets.  Users/MichaelPlotkin
