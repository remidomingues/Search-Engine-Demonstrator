Despite all her names Pennys owners arent really big fans of Dio, Warren Zevon or Prince.

Penny has many hobbies and interests, some of which include the following:

  Chasing / wrestling with cats
  Sleeping
  Making sure nobody is sleeping
  Users/TaylorStreet Coprophagia
  Humping inanimate objects
  Chewing (she loves Beechnut)
  Vampire hunting
  Playfully biting people in inappropriate places
  Creating situations with electronics for Brad to troubleshoot / fix (to make sure he doesnt get rusty).
  Hiding gifts for people to find later
  Licking
  Stealing panties
  Theoretical physics, particularly string theory

Some of these she learned from her owners (no, not the coprophagia) and some she learned from her buddy Users/AlinaAsrian Alina
