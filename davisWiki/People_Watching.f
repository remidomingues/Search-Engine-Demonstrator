People Watching, or armchair social Anthropology anthropology, involves watching People people interact with each other and their surroundings. Here are some prime peoplewatching locations:

  Nugget Nugget Market in North Davis has tables inside by the registers where you can sit and eat. Not only do you get to watch people, but you get to see what kind of Grocery Stores groceries theyre buying.  Nuggets outside tables are great for watching kids and parents interact in the summer.
  The Patio at Sophias Thai Kitchen has a Bars bar which faces E Street. This vantage point is good for watching the bar crowds stumble around on nights when Downtown downtown is busy.
  The Memorial Union has tables on the south side of the building, often occupied by Fraternities, Jehovahs Witnesses, or Users/SteveLambert Steve Lambert. Theres a reservation process, but if a table is open, grab it.
  The Rec Pool has nearly Naked People naked people walking about.

  Probably the best place in Davis to peoplewatch is at the Davis Farmers Market Davis Farmers Market on Saturday mornings.  In the summer they also hold Picnic In The Park there on Wenzday evenings  with musicians and lots of food booths.
