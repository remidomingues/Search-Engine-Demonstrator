20100714 23:59:11 nbsp I am looking for sponsorships so that I can become the best Wiki Gnome possible. I accept for payment Burgers and Brew cheeseburgers, Droms Comics and Cards Magic booster packs, Taco Bell tacos, Hot Dogger hot dogs, Droms Comics and Cards comic books, The Guad nachos, Sunrise Restaurant sandwiches, chicken wings, sushi, and Yoloberry frozen yogurt.

20100715 01:29:36 nbsp IIRC theres some place in Davis that gives 10% off if you mention youre going to put up a review on Daviswiki. Users/MasonMurray

20100715 04:37:58 nbsp Poppycock.. Why pay someone to remove mean comments when you could easily do it yourself. ALthough, this would most likely begin an edit war and in the year 2072, the Wiki would be taken over by intelligent bots who would seek out and destroy any humans with an original thought. But we have 60 years to think about this before that happens...  Whats that noise?   OH MY GOD, A BOT!!! Users/WesOne
