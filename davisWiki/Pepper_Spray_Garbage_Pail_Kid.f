In October 2012, http://www.topps.com/ Topps, best known for its collectible baseball cards and wiki:wikipedia:Garbage Pail Kids, released a GPK set with what appears to be a UC Pepper Spray Lt. John Pikeinspired character affectionately named Ray Spray. The card features a batonwielding officer with a cracked helmet dousing a teddy bear at pointblank range whilst barricaded puppies, kitties, piglets, and children bear witness, shouldering signs that read We Are 100% Cute, Occupy Dollstreet, No More Naptime, and the wiki:wikipedia:Pink Floydreferencing We Dont Need No Education. As all GPKs have doubles, Ray Sprays double is Brutal Barry.

If youre looking for a free copy, Topps constantly gives stuff away on Twitter.  For context of what they current publish, Topps cards recently did an MMA series.  Daubert notes this and questions, This card is pretty interesting I wonder what made them do it (other than the http://daviswiki.org/John_Pike#heada601ac2f568b166ac91b57d88e9bb1b9bb59d50f bandwagon).
