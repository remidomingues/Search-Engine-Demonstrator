Peregrine School is a Nonprofit organizations nonprofit private schools school that strives to integrate the rigorous academics of a classical liberal arts education with childcentered, projectbased learning. Arts and sciences, as well as Spanish, are taught daily through projects. Weekly enrichment classes include yoga, dance, music, and drama taught by specialists.

Health and nutrition are equally important aspects of the school, which includes daily physical education activities as well as gardens and a nutritious lunch and snack program. The school is committed to small size classes and very low studentteacher ratios. CoDirectors, Lorie Hammond, PhD, and Elena Whitcombe, MD, a motherdaughter team, founded the school in 2007.

Peregrine School consists of an elementary school, a preK/K class (nicknamed Primaria), and a preschool (nicknamed Escuelita). All class levels at Peregrine are bilingual (SpanishEnglish) and projectbased, influenced by the Reggio Emilia philosophy. Peregrine offers programs in preschool through 6th grade. Escuelita is currently open to children ages 2 to 4, Primaria to ages 4 to 6, and the elementary class to grade six.

Peregrine School also offers summer camps for children ages 214. The summer program includes camps in dance, filmmaking, theatre, survival skills, art, and science. You can view the full summer catalog online http://www.peregrineschool.org/Other%20Documents/ELEM%20Summer%20Brochure%202014%20FINAL%20PDF%202.pdf here or on the website.

What is projectbased learning?

Projectbased learning is an approach to education that involves a deep exploration of all subjects through a common theme. We use this integrated, thematic curriculum as a way to foster a greater and more meaningful understanding of all subjects. For example, using the theme of oceans and river systems, Primaria students learn to read and write stories about real and mythical ocean creatures, integrate water themes into their yoga practice, and learn about life cycles, temperature, and time by raising salmon from eggs and eventually releasing them into the Sacramento river. Because all subjects can be explored through any theme, we can use the childrens interests as the foundation of short and longterm projects.

What is Reggio Emilia?

Reggio Emilia is an educational philosophy led by Loris Malaguzzi founded in postWWII Italy. The Reggio Emilia approach is distinguished by the following elements:

• Focus on collaborative play
• Short and longterm projects as the foundation of the cirriculum
• An inspiring and productive school environment (the third teacher)
• Ongoing documentation as a means of evaluation
• A supportive community of parents and teachers
• Childdirected learning
• Emphasis on the arts
• Teachers as colearners

Children’s work is play. Collaborative play, the business of school, is enhanced by two things: a rich environment designed to provide stimulation, challenges, and openended spaces for creative exploration; and the mentoring of expert teachers, who interact with children and model skills in various intelligence areas and the process of problemsolving.

In the classroom, we employ an integrated thematic curriculum, which nurtures learning in many intelligence areas: linguistic, mathematical, visual, musical, kinesthetic, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and naturalistic. Using this approach, themes are chosen by the week or month, and a series of experiences in all domains are planned to explore the theme. This approach makes learning comprehensivechildren can integrate what they are learning about the harvest or phases of the moon in science lessons, stories, music, and dance expression.

Young children are open to learning in every domain. Our goal is to create a balanced set of opportunities for learning in all domains, rather than to focus only on language and mathematics, as many school programs do. This goal is modeled by the Loris Malaguzzis school in Reggio Emilia, Italy. The key is to create an everchanging, creative learning environment in which children can guide their own projects, with direction provided by knowledgeable adults who are experts in their area.  Essential to this model is the idea that children do best when guided by experts. Children at Peregrine School will interact with a variety of professional artists as well as their teachers during the school day.

How is Peregrine School different from Montessori schools?

While the Peregrine School philosophy is influenced mainly by Reggio Emilia, we also draw inspiration from the Montessori and Waldorf approaches and philosophers John Dewey, Howard Gardner and Daniel Pink. Reggio Emilia and Montessori methods can be seen as sister philosophies. One important difference is the role of the teacher. In a Montessori environment, the teacher takes an unobtrusive role, holding a space in which children direct their own learning. In a Reggio environment, the teacher takes on the role of colearner, exploring and guiding children through their education. This delicate balance is achieved through continual evaluation of individual students and the class as a whole, and is enriched by daily small group work.

Why Spanish?

Early childhood is the best time for children to acquire language in a natural, oral settingtheir minds absorb language like sponges. If a second language is added early, it is painless for a child to learn, it will become more natural to the child than a language learned later in life, and it will help the child to learn additional languages more easily. There is also much research evidence that speaking two or more languages increases a child’s level of general intelligence.

Spanish is the most important second language in California. Spanish fluency has immediate applications to daily life here. We intend to balance our student population to include many native Spanish speakers. Our main teachers are native Spanish speakers who model the language, sheltering it for accessibility to the children through the use of visuals, music, and the like. Fantastic Friday science and art activities, music, and yoga are taught in English and supplemented in Spanish.

Peregrine School is a dualimmersion program. Lessons and routines are delivered in Spanish by the teachers for part of the day, and reading and math are taught in English. Since the emphasis of the preschool is on oral rather than written language, young children are not required to read in a language that is not their first. This will ensure that children can learn to read in their own language, then transfer their skills to literacy in a second.

Why a family school?

Peregrine School was founded on the idea that families are a childs first and most important teachers, and that a community of families and teachers can guide our children by pooling their various funds of knowledge. In asking parents to participate in the school, we hope to build a caring community of families who support all of our children, and to share with all the many talents we individually possess. To accomplish the first goal, we provide enrichments like yoga and Spanish classes for adults, potluck dinners, discussion groups, and family outings. And by volunteering in the classroom, parents get to know each others children, building our sense of community. To accomplish the second, we provide opportunities for parents to share their special skills and interests with the students and staff at school.

Parent involvement can take many forms, such as volunteer work in the classroom, driving and chaperoning field trips, and taking on a family task. We will work with parents to create the right method of involvement for each family.

Without grades, how will I know how my child is doing?

Instead of using grades to evaluate our students progress, we keep portfolios on every student. The strength of portfolios is that each childs progress is measured against his/her own development. Since material is added to student portfolios constantly, portfolios give a more detailed and more accurate picture of your childs development than a grade. While grades attempt to measure a students academic ability by tallying test scores and homework assignments, we document the growth of our students entire academic, social, and emotional progress.

In assessment, as in all things, we seek balance. In addition to individual assessments, such as portfolios, we will also measure student progress against grade level standards and other developmental benchmarks, so that parents have a realistic idea of their childs progress.

As Peregrine students become older, they can participate more actively in determining their own learning goals and in displaying their learning through portfolios and through oral presentations.

What are Peregrines ratios like?

Our studentteacher ratio is 6:1. Low ratios ensure that each child receives an great deal of individual attention and guidance. Low ratios also facilitate small group work, which is an important part of the day at Peregrine School.


20090703 16:23:48 nbsp does the name peregrine come from lord of the rings, fitting in with the nearby streets of the Village Homes? Users/TimMatthiessen
  Given the logo, it is more likely that it has to do with the wiki:wikipedia:Peregrine falcon.  The Duck Hawk School doesnt have quite the same ring.

20110323 14:21:10 nbsp I would love to get feedback from anyone who has a child in the Escuelita on what the school is like.   Users/BlytheDurbinJohnson

20110331 11:43:44 nbsp I have three kids at Peregrine and am extremely impressed and happy. I moved to Davis from the Bay Area about 2 years ago, and admittedly have high standards for my kids schools. I visited/considered many preschools in Davis, and am extremely pleased with Peregrine. The kids have so much fun. They get individualized academic attention within a stimulating and inspiring curriculum. They also get plenty of fresh air and excellent food. Most importantly, all three of my kids are well cared for and very happy. I hope to keep my kids here for elementary. Users/SarahLamborn

20130118 21:27:58 nbsp I have a child at the elementary and the preschool. I am very happy with both campuses. The small class sizes are amazing and the kids really get attention from the caring and involved teachers. The social and emotional support for my older child is tremendous. My younger child has many severe food allergies and the chef works diligently to ensure both his nutrition and safety. And the academics are taught in interesting, challenging, and developmentally appropriate ways. Love this school! Users/LizPhinney
