Permaculture is an approach to designing human settlements and agricultural systems that is modeled on the relationships found in nature. It is based on the ecology of how things interrelate rather than on the strictly biological concerns that form the foundation of modern agriculture. Permaculture aims to create stable, productive systems that provide for human needs; its a system of design where each element supports and feeds other elements, ultimately aiming at systems that are virtually selfsustaining and into which humans fit as an integral part.

Village Homes is our most obvious example of wiki:WikiPedia:Permaculture permaculture design in Davis, being world famous even.
 Bill Mollison, the creator of Permaculture has commented extensively on Village Homes. Here is a video of him walking around Village Homes > http://www.youtube.com/watch?vOSsCvpDbMW8
Sometime in the mid80s there was a Davisbased Permaculture Communications that was active.  Permaculture has been discussed and utilized by people involved in the Experimental College, the Domes at UCD, probably even at some of the cohousing or cooperatives here in town.  Information is being researched and gathered about permaculturetype activities in Davis by the Davis Permaculture Guild.  DPG is hoping to present permaculture, sustainability and localization events in Davis.
 Does anyone know what happened to this group? Or is anyone interested in getting this happening again?  Users/ConsciousConsumer
