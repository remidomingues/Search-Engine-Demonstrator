You ever notice how some pools of water just never seem to disappear despite their shallowness and the heat. Something must not be attuned correctly with the universe for this to keep happening. This page is step one on the path to solving these mysteries by listing all the Perpetual Puddles in need of our rescue.

This page is similar in goals to the Pothole Project and the Sidewalk Crack Project
With information at the ready we can hopefully persuade the powers that be to implement saner watering practices, fix some broken pipes and keep our shoes dry.


Based on the responses to my original mystery picture (Walker Hall pictured above) there are obviously quite a few puddles in need of salvation.

 Well, yes a little crazy. Whats really crazy is that it looks like this almost every day of the year. Im actually going to start a page called Perpetual Puddles soon. You didnt specify which side of the Quad, but the answer is no there are no such ramps along the Quad. Users/AlexMandel

     20070610 03:02:29 nbsp I remember a big puddle like this one by the crosswalk leading to Shields Library on the south side of the Quad. I always had to walk around it due to water. Users/Jedron

     20070610 08:24:39 nbsp west side of the coffee house?  I always remember a puddle there?  (though techincally thats about the same area as the quad) Users/WesHardaker

     20070610 13:31:48 nbsp It could also be one of the places near the Art Building drama/arts building, there are a few ramps there and a fire lane.. Users/DavidPoole

      20070610 13:48:48 nbsp looks like the puddle i always step in in front of walker.  Users/Chadsharply
 And the winner is you! Got a new pic to put up?
