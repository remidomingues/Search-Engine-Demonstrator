Davis has Cockroaches bugs.  Far fewer bugs than most places due to our weather climate, but one bug doing a marathon across your kitchen floor is really more than enough.  If you want to get rid of your bugs, try taking a shower or running an antivirus program.  If there are still living bugs running around after that, call the professionals.  If there are undead bugs running around, call the Ghostbusters.

UC Davis is host to the statewide Integrated Pest Management Program.
