20080110 08:22:03 nbsp Just walking by, it looks like a nice place but also looks like it is pretty expensive...I have not been in yet and will do so soon. Just my first impression... Users/MyaBrn

20080115 09:06:29 nbsp Finally made it over last night.  My expectations were met!  She carries all sorts of really good food, for both dogs and cats, as well as as a great variety of treats.  Her prices are reasonable too.  Just what we needed in town; an alternative to Petco that carries decent products I can actually give my dog & cats!   Users/CindiDrake

20080325 13:29:02 nbsp I have been looking for a special brand of dog food for a while, so I decided to call this place. Not only did they have it, the one person working was super nice. Its a very nice little pet shop and everything was reasonably priced, they even had free food samples of the dog food I was buying so I knew that my dog would love it! Not as chaotic as Petco. I will definitely be returning. Users/BrandonMinow

 If it was the rather attractive brunette in her 30s, then that would be the owner. I visited this place a month or so ago and was pleasantly surprised considering I frequented the previous pet shop that resided here back when I still had my cat. When I intend to get a pet again, I know I will be coming here.  The customer service is amazing; talking with her there was like having a friend that owned a pet store. I felt so comfortable hanging out there for half an hour talking about all sorts of pet stories without any pressure to buy something.

20080507 14:34:20 nbsp As owner of Elizabeths Pet Sitting, I met the owner at several events including Davis Dog Meetup at Toad Hollow and 2008 Dog Gone walkathon. She is very professional and dedicated to her business. She has a log book in which she notes special order items for her customers. I have visited the store a couple of times and am very happy to report that there is a wide variety of high quality pet foods and treats. The photo board of frequent clients is a nice touch to this store. If she does not carry an item dont be afraid to ask as she will order it or refer you to someplace that does.  Overall, highly recommended a great pet supply store that has everything any pet could possible want. My clients dogs love the breathe buster star treats. Happy shopping :)  Users/ElizabethBarthel

20080914 20:04:40 nbsp I love this place! There is a huge variety of dog and cat food and a ton of samples. My animals are usually picky, but they ended up liking everything I brought home. The lady that was working when I came in told me about each different brand and helped me pick out things that would be best for each of my animals needs. Users/meister

20090115 11:01:51 nbsp This place is awesome. Everyones always really friendly, and they have a great selection. When the old place closed, I had to drive to Woodland to get the food I wanted, but they carry it. They also offer to order things youre looking for in different sizes. Just wonderful overall. Users/GreenThing

20090119 10:49:04 nbsp Great selection of products and interactive toys. This place also caters to the customer. If they dont have a particular item in stock ,they will try to order for you. I recently ordered a specialized water bowl. My puppy also loves his kong wubba and Tug a Jug. The staff is also very friendly. I also heard that they are opening a bigger store in Sacramento. Shop here for all your pets needs. However, they only carry cat and dog items, no rabbit,bird,reptile, or fish. Users/AnneBrowning

20090203 21:39:55 nbsp I am a frequent buyer at pet pantry. The prices have gone up a bit and lately they seem to be out of my dogs food every time I go. I think I will start shopping at Davis Ace. Users/downtownDon

20090218 14:02:36 nbsp Pet Pantry is a good, if boutiquey alternative to groceries, Ace, etc.  They have a good selection of natural style pet food versus mainstream brands.  BIG PROBLEM: on two separate occasions several months apart I arrived during business hours but the store was inexplicably closed.  Both times this happened in the morning.  Suggestion  if you cant be there at the posted hour, post a later hour.  I waited for 15 minutes & watched at least 2 other potential shoppers walk to the door, pull onit, look inside, check their watch, wait a minute, & leave.  I know it is a small local business but it is also located on the ourskirts of town, has limited hours, & is not easy to bike to, therefore I have to make special trips to go there & it is frustrating when it is not open as it posts it should be.

20090413 18:22:28 nbsp all the workers are really nice and they all love animals unlike at petco they are mean and some just work there to get paid. great prices with free samples, one of the workers dogs is cute too :) Users/Churro615

20091004 08:06:08 nbsp Just got an email saying that Pet Pantry will be closing :( Users/ElizabethBarthel

20091021 14:54:42 nbsp Im sad this place has closed. Users/ChristinaS.

20091111 19:07:53 nbsp Sad to see another independent pet shop leave Davis.  :(  FYI, Davis Ace can special order most of the food Pet Pantry carried, if they dont already stock it. Users/jcarep
