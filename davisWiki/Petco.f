Ive found lots of great prices and selection on supplies for your pets  however I have not been impressed with the actual pets they sell  Especially the fish. I went there today and HALF of the tanks were not for sale due to illness.  If your looking for fish  buy the tank and whatever else there  but buy the fish at Capitol Aquarium or Exotic Aquarium (both in Sac).  Ive also seen many sick reptiles and birds as well that should have been receiving better care.  Users/PeterAnselmo

20050610 10:05:53 nbsp I was quite impressed with the Davis Petco people. I have a friend with MS, and she was having a rough day, where getting out of her car and into the store would have been an ordeal. She needed to get some pet food, and the people at Petco were nice enough to let her stay in her car in the parking lot while they got her stuff, and took care of the money. Whatever else you want to say about Petco, that impressed me, and Im happy to shop there after that. Users/EricKlein

20050911 17:21:53 nbsp I havent had a single fish live that Ive bought from PetCo while other fish Ive gotten from Pet Cetera (downtown) and Capitol Aquarium (Sac) are doing just fine.  Their feeders are especially bad.  Theyre small, thin and sick looking and some dont even survive a five minute ride home in the car.  If youre looking for fish, shop somewhere else. Users/JoeMarchi

20051015 21:09:28 nbsp I agree on the count of fish, our fish from Petco never live long. However Im usually pleased with their rodents, and the SPCA do great there. Users/MaggieBlank

20051221 04:11:25 nbsp I actually didnt know these things about Petco. Ive been in the Covell location several times for my bird, but I dont think Ive bought anything. The people werent extraordinarily helpful. I did enjoy that the bird areas had consider adoption signs first. SS

20060821 18:09:40 nbsp Adding to the list of complaints...this petco is very poorly stocked! I have been in there 4 times in the past 3 weeks to get mice and they only get pinkies in stock  making feeding my snake 3x as expensive as it should be Users/SandyRose

20070116 17:41:01 nbsp I am kinda worried about their chinchillas. The temperature at petco is, like 85 degrees, and temperatures over 80 could kill a chinchilla, if they are exposed to it for an extended period of time. Users/RaymondMyers

20070117 19:35:09 nbsp They remodeled this past summer and seem to be better stocked, many of the pets for sale received new living quarters. Users/MeganOster

20070512 18:16:21 nbsp If you buy fish, make sure not to use chlorinated Davis tap water straight from the tap. That is what kills fish. (Edited)Use water that has no chlorine. Make sure you have an air pump in the water so your fish dont suffocate. Users/Jedron
  Be VERY CAREFUL if you try to use distilled water.  From wikipedia: Some people use distilled water for household aquariums because it lacks the chemicals found in tap water supplies. It is important to supplement distilled water when using it for fishkeeping; it is too pure to sustain proper chemistry to support an aquarium ecosystem.  Remember Bio 1B?  Distilled water has no ions and messes with animal cells makeup. Users/AllisonEriksen
 Edited. Thanks for the advice.
  We have used tap water for our freshwater fish for 3 years and havent had many deaths, but we do usually allow the water to sit a few hours before putting it in the tank.
  To add: You can buy a drop solution that gets rid of the chlorine.  Available at most pet stores.  I only use tap water with the drops, and Ive had regular old goldfish last for YEARS!  Users/KristineSlipson

20070513 12:57:21 nbsp Ive been using Davis water straight from the tap for over three years and my fish are still alive. I also put in NovAqua and AmQuel after adding the new water. Users/EmmyMelton

20070513 14:48:44 nbsp Davis water probably didnt kill the goldfish then. Actually, it was an unfortunate incident where the goldfishs owner went out of town and the roommates had to take care of the fish and the fish ended up dying (probably because there was no air pump). Everyone in the apartment was freaking out because we knew who would get blamed for the fishs death. So everyone thought about bringing the dead fish to Petco to get a new fish that looked just like the dead one. Oh, the shame. Users/Jedron

20070823 15:25:33 nbsp Dont buy pets from Petco.  They are always sick.  We bought a hamster and it died 4 days later.  Then we bought a rat and it got sick the next day.  When I returned the rat to Petco so they could take it to the vet (supposedly) they called me and told me that it had died.  When I looked at the other rats I realized that they were all suffering from the same respiratory infection as mine.  I alerted the staff which could care less.  Evidently this is normal practice to sell sickly pets.  The girl working the cash register actually told me to go to a privately owned pet store in Woodland and to not ever buy pets from Petco because the place they get their pets from is bad.  She said the pets are always sick.      Users/kmmahan

20070908 14:04:05 nbsp I have yet to buy any pets from petco due to the consistent complaints about them. I did notice this store is significantly less clean and pleasant as the other ones Ive been too, but its fine. They were bringing in some crickets at the time and had the cricket stinky cardboard about. It wasnt that bad though. I went to look at the fish, and many of them seemed okay. None of them I saw had signs saying that they were not for sale. They cashier was very friendly. As for my fish, I have used Davis tap water with dechlorinator from the capital aquarium and it has worked just find for all 10 of my fish.  Users/AnnaF

20070920 01:10:25 nbsp Tap water CAN kill your fish, folks.  However, you can add water treatments to it so that it is safe to use for your fishy friends.  Chlorine and chloramine are harmful to fish, and the addition of water treatments can get rid of the harmful stuff.  Tap water is the cheapest way to fill your fish tank, just make sure you buy tap water conditioner. Users/JennSuzuki

20070920 16:12:32 nbsp Its funny to me that most of the comments here have to do with buying pets  I think of this place more as a place to get pet supplies.  They have a reasonable, if not amazing selection of pet products, pet food, etc.  probably more than anything else in Davis at the moment, but thats not a very high bar.  The pick out your own treat sounded like a good idea to me until I saw the treats  they all look and smell like cookies.  Maybe its just me, but I wouldnt give a dog something like that because its just going to make the dog want the human version.  The people in the grooming area are friendly and seem to genuinely care about the animals, but the setup there is a bit bleak (animals in cages off in a separate room, often just left there to bark), and weve had trouble with not being taken at the time of our appointment, so that the dog just ends up sitting around.  The first time they did what we asked them to, but the second time some things were left undone. Users/CovertProfessor
  Two of the treats in the treat bar are actually low fat treats (a lot of people like to use them for training), the pretzel shaped ones and the little multicolored balls.  The grooming department is pretty popular, so sometimes they get behind on things.  If something you requested isnt done, just let them know and Im sure theyll be happy to fix it. Users/JennSuzuki
   Thanks for the info on the treats  Ill look for the lowfat ones.  As for the grooming department, yes, they get behind, but the result is that your dog is left by itself in a cage while they deal with the backlog.  After 6 hours of that, Im not going to subject a dog to more grooming.  As I said, they are nice people, and maybe they are forced to take a certain number of appointments per day, but (in my experience, anyway) its more than they can handle.  Users/CovertProfessor

20071021 12:14:05 nbsp After having buying several fish there, I have this to say:
Do not use our Hard tap water for your fish without regulating the Ph level to meet your fishs needs, and always use the basic dechlorinator/conditioner too. This may have been partly why people have said their fish always die.
Always look for Parasites on the fish at the store, and make sure the fish you buy is swimming normally and doesnt look discolored.
Do not buy their feeder fish for pets (buy pet goldfish instead)

I would also like to note that all of my fish here have survived a few months so far, and they are doing great. Utilize the knowledge of the staff to select a good filter, and always bring a sample every once in a while to test to see if your water is good for your fish. Fish are very sensitive, and require a lot of attention to their water quality. Please keep that in mind when selecting a fish for a pet. Also research fish before putting them together in aquariums because different species have different temperature and social needs.

I have been very successful with Petcos fish.  Users/AnnaF

20071106 00:58:39 nbsp Ive noticed that tropical fish in northern california are significantly more expensive than their southern california counterparts.  For example fish like the red devil cichlid which i bought for $7 in socal is 45 here, is it just in the sac area or all over nor cal? Users/heyitsdimo

20080220 08:17:16 nbsp This petco is a nice place to buy supplies, especially for regular old dogs and cats.  Im somewhat amused and a little more dismayed at their huge selection of dog clothing and little dog handbags.  Seriously?  How many little doggy sailer outfits and rain jackets do they sell?  Id be happier with the place if they used that space to carry more useful products for birds, reptiles and small mammals.  I see a lot of fish talk on the comments, but if anyone knew a good reptile place in Sacramento, Id be happy to hear of it. Users/CaitlinMorrow

20080310 11:59:35 nbsp I took my dog to get groomed here and she left completely freaked out! I had originally taken her to get her glands cleaned. They talked me into the full service and I agreed.

20080821 20:14:47 nbsp Does anyone have any experience with their grooming department?  I wanted to drop my dog off to get groomed during my lunch hour and wondered if they will hold him until I get off work around six.  Do grooming places usually let you leave your pets there for that long? It would be five hours or so... Users/carrisaharding

I have used their grooming department and yes it is possible for you to leave your dog there around your lunch time and then pick it up again later after work. Their grooming department is pretty good imho.

20080930 11:36:34 nbsp Last year I noticed a very ill Parakeet and the employees were not at all cooperative when I asked that something be done to help this birdlong story short, the bird was taken out when I insisted on it, and immediately died in my hands (it was emaciated). I was accused of killing the bird (how absurd!) and told by the Assistant Manager that they would call the Police on me if I ever came back to the store. Petco needs to take responsibility for this because the bird didnt get that way overnight and how lame to try and pin the blame on me.... Users/Lory

20081105 12:06:37 nbsp petco really is a horrible place where animals go to die, ive been several times and each time you can spot the dead or dying ones with ease. too bad they dont care Users/WeiChun

20081202 19:55:51 nbsp petco is terrible. no one should by anything from them if they dont have to. I only go there to buy rats because I have an 8 foot red tail boa and it is the only place within a practical distance that sells rats. I hate going there though because they sell the same rats for pets as for feeders. its terrible. back home I only buy feeder rats that are bred as such. plus, the people who work there are ALWAYS really rude to me and take forever to help me grab a rat  there can be three people at the registers kickin it and talking and no one will come out to help me.

and about the whole fish thing  the reason most of the fish die is because most big pet chains (especially petco) catch their fish by spraying poison into where ever the fish are hiding which causes the fish to usually come out to escape the poison or they pass out and then the people catch them and bring them to the stores. the fish are stunned from the poison but usually die or at least get very sick soon after  aka when you buy them.

there is a lot of shady business going on in the pet trade industry and I wouldnt trust ever buying a pet from some place like petco. dont support them if you dont have to. there are other pet supply stores. Users/brie311

20081231 11:34:42 nbsp My wife and I buy nearly all of our cat supplies there and weve never had anything but positive experiences. From the floor people to the register, everyones always nice, offer to help when I look like Im lost and take the time to get what I need. They also help with the Yolo County SPCA to help adopt out foster cats and dogs. Weve fostered several kittens and the people at Petco are always so helpful about the adoption days. In addition, I havent found lower prices on the same products anywhere in Davis. Believe me, Ive tried. Users/condemned2bfree

20090112 11:46:44 nbsp Petco is great for pet supplies. They also have a nice grooming station. In terms of buying pets though(dogs).... it may seem like an easy place to find what you are looking for but you are better off checking the newspaper for private owners selling puppies. Who would want to buy an animal from a franchise? God only knows where they get the animals from.... and if you are not picky you can always come in on a saturday and the SPCA has dogs that you can adopt.

Generally speaking, I wouldnt buy any animal, fish, or reptile from a large chain of stores like petco, but they are still a great place to shop for accessories! Just my two cents. Users/Sylvano

20090122 13:27:18 nbsp Ive had mixed experiences here. I found a bird in my car (its a funny story so ask me about it some time) and took it to petco. They knew very little about it and tried to tell me it was a sparrow (it was a finch). When I decided to keep it they were friendly and helpful at selling me accouterments and toys for the bird.
An aside; their vaccination clinics are fast, and friendly. The prices for accessories, toys, and food seems to be cheap and of good quality. I just wouldnt recommend getting advice or pets there.  Users/MasonMurray

20090225 22:06:55 nbsp I have mixed reviews on PETCO.I like coming here for supplies when they have sales and love their clearance section. You can find lots of deals and specials if you watch the ads. Some of my finds include medium sized Nylabones originally marked 7 dollars and on sale for $1.50. Saturdays are a great day to come because representatives come here to promote their products and often hand out samples, freebies, and even coupons for free products. Being a pet sitter I buy a lot of  dog toys and am happy to report that they carry most of the good quality ones. I was dissapointed to find that PETCO is still carrying the pimple ball with bell .DO NOT BUY THIS TOY http://www.thechaistory.blogspot.com/) Now on to the fish which seems to be a controversy on the wiki. You do need to condition the water with any fish tank especially with Davis water. The key and success to buying fish from PETCO is to avoid tanks with sick,dead, or unhealthy fish thata have ick(white spots on bodies and tail) Ask an employee if unsure, they will usually tell you. PETCO is a major chain and way overstocks their fish tanks and so there are fish that are floating in the tank dead in at least every 3 or so tanks. That said, if you go on a Wed when PETCO gets their fish shipment their selection is going to be better and the fish should be healthier. I have bought a few fish from PETCO and have not had any problems. They will also give you baby fry for free if you ask for them. They have a great selection of fish supplies and foods and are cheaper then ACE on supplies and average in price on fish compared to ACE.  Users/ElizabethBarthel


20090608 22:08:38 nbsp Why on earth does it matter what the rats are bred for? That is the stupidest complaint I think Ive ever heard. Can someone elaborate why its terrible to sell rats in one cage for people to do as they wish, rather than in two cages one labeled feeder and one pet? Users/JohnathanQuigley
   Because feeder animals are horribly inbred and suffer mental and physical defects and are prone to disease.  If youre just planning on feeding them to snakes, it doesnt matter  just leave two rats in a tank, let them breed, and then let all the sisters and brothers breed together and repeat.  Its also done quite often with feeder mice  its a very common practice if you just want to raise small animals to feed to other animals.  The problem is that if youre planning on hand raising them as pets, you get all kind of problems with those inbred feeder lineages.  For a pet, you really want a intentionally bred lineage or at least genetic diversity.  If youre thinking the distinction is just due to some kind of moral distinction, it isnt  its simple hard and scientific genetics, and applies in the same way to any other animal used for food or otherwise genetically culled at that generation like rabbits or chickens.    Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

 In that case, the issue is selling inbred/suffering mice as pets (or selling them at all), not with selling pet rats as feeders (or selling the same rats for each.) I dont know if Ive made myself clear, so forgive me if Im repeating myself. I certainly acknowledge a problem in selling inbred animals as pets. However, if the animals sold as pets are inbred and suffering, Im assuming the complaint would have been worded that way, instead of they sell the same mice for feeders as for pets. Are they using a feeder lineage as pets? Or are they allowing you to buy a pet lineage as feeders? From my trips to the store, no suffering on account of genetic defects was apparent, so I assume the latter is the case.
   Rats for pets also need to be hand tamed, and conditioned to be OK with people.  It seems rather cruel to me to get the rats used to being held, and then abuse that trust and feed them to a snake.  users/masonmurray MM
   Ive gotten several genetically defective mice from this Petco.  Defective as in a breeder health fault: one had congenital skin issues, one had mental issues with compulsive waltzing (a technical term for a particular behavior), and one had neurotic grooming to self mutilation (and mutilated another poor female in the isolation cage).  More importantly for this discussion, these are all problems that make the mice unsuitable for pets.  These are all common side effects of poor genetics, and the last is aggravated by lack of hand training.  These are all from fancy mice being sold as pets or food.  Some other big chains have distinct cages of mice available as either pets or feeder animals (with the pets being more expensive, as they are more difficult to breed).  The situation is simply put: the source for Petcos mice are of poor genetics for pets.  Fine for food.  Bad for pets.  Thats the only problem with them.  Also, I doubt youd see many genetic defects while looking at them at the store, as the fatal genetic problems have already been fished out, and the behavioral and more subtle physical issues are usually not often apparent in the tank.  Most of this doesnt matter at all  unless you want to get pet mice, which is one of the reasons people go to Petco.  Then its a pretty important distinction.  I have no idea about their rats; I dont raise rats. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

By the way Im curious now. I heard two customers in front of me at PetCo laughing about how PETA had made people stop separating the mice into colors because it was racist. I had no idea what they were talking about, and forgot about it until now. Could it be that PETA wanted to stop this separation to reduce inbreeding, but other people have mischaracterized their intentions? Do you have any light to shed on this for me?
   Ive never heard of this, and it doesnt make much sense.  They are divided by sex, and you can put a male texel red in with a male variegated dove all you want and they arent going to breed (in breeder circles, this is known as Youre doing it wrong).  In most cases they are split when sexed before they arrive at the store, although I do not know if this is the case for Petco.  They certainly divide them by sex in the store.

20090723 16:32:18 nbsp The help is mediocre at this store, but the grooming is just awful.  One of the groomers is loud and obnoxious and is really rough with the dogs.  As I was walking by she yanked a dog off the table without even bothering to lower it.  I have a friends that will no longer take their dogs here to be groomed because of the mean natured grooming they provide.  Ironically, this same groomer does pet sitting from her home (service was offered to me when she eavesdropped on a conversation I was having) and is the dog training instructor for Petco.

He seems pretty knowledgeable on fish.

Weve also brought my cat and dogs here on several occasions and they are always well treated.

I recently bought a $20 Petco branch retractable leash that broke after about 10 uses (no longer retracted). When I brought it back to the store they refused to exchange it  for one that worked because the purchase had been made more than 30 days ago. I would expect more than 10 uses out of such an expensive leash. I purchased the product right before leaving for vacation and did not even open it for the first time until more than 30 days after my purchase.

20110329 12:57:35 nbsp I have had really good luck with intelligent caring workers in the reptile section. Lesandra (?) the reptile specialist obviously really knows her stuff about snakes and I got wonderful help from the really nice guy with long brown hair that works in the reptile area too. One thing I really love is that if they do not know an answer they will tell you straight out and give you some ideas as to where to look for the correct one, which in my opinion is wayyyy better than people that bluff or make up answers that can lead to harm to your pet.

I noticed that their corn snakes had mites but when I brought it up they responded that they knew and told me about the regiment they were going through to treat them. I would still never buy a reptile there, but it is not the workers faults that Petco buys wholesale unhealthy animals. From what I have seen the workers do their best to keep the reptiles they receive healthy and happy.

Also Petco has the cheapest frozen rats and mice you can find in Davis. If I cannot get to Berkeley to buy them at East Bay Vivarium I buy my snakes dinner at Petco.  Users/DanielleC

20110524 18:06:50 nbsp I used to take my cat here to get his nails clipped with no problems but one day I was told that there was not anyone there at the time who was qualified to perform the service.  The person who told me this was the very person who had clipped his nails every single time I had previously brought him in.  Perhaps they were not supposed to be doing it and got in trouble and were forced to stop?  So the next time I called in advance to figure out if someone who was qualified was there and they told me that they only clip cats nails at 8 am because there are less dogs to upset the cats.  The process takes a whole three minutes and my cat never minded the several dogs wandering around the room but whatever, policy is policy.  I am a college student.  I am not getting up at 8 am to get my cats nails clipped.  It seemed shady that at first I could come in at any time with no problem and then one day I could only come at 8 am so my cat wouldnt be upset.  Other than that I havent had  any problems with the merchandise or staff.  It would be nice if they had more cashiers.  One cashier offered to carry a box of litter to my car for me but acted like merely offering this really put him out.  I carried it myself but appreciated the semisincere offer.    Users/LoriOrf

20110810 16:11:55 nbsp The prices at Petco are pretty awful. Two examples: I bought a chewproof water bottle for $14 and then saw it at Pet Extreme for $10. And the $15 big bag of hay I get at Petsmart is usually on sale at Petco for $20. The other problem is that with a smaller location like this one they dont always have everything in stock. For example, the last couple times I went in they only had smaller bags of hay. If you have an actual picture of a competitors price (NOT an online printout), they will usually match it. One of the nicer cashiers recently warned me that this policy might stop soon, though.  If that happens, Ill be driving the extra distance to Petsmart. Users/MeggoWaffle

20120115 17:03:42 nbsp Tried to take my dog here to be mashed/brushed. They wouldnt take him without rabies paperwork which, of course, I dont keep in my wallet. He has a tag on his collar with his rabies information, but apparently this is insufficient. Ill just go someplace else. Users/JoePomidor

20131218 10:57:51 nbsp Dont go to any Petco  period. I wanted to return some lightly used fishtanks (perfectly clean) and on the Petco website it says Without receipt or over 60 days, you are eligible for a merchandise credit for the lowest price sold but they wont take it past 30 days. So the website and Petco return policy are all total lies. I dont mind not being able to return it, I just wish I knew the whole story before I bought anything so I can factor that into my decisionmaking process BEFORE I buy anything. Im so done with Petco.
