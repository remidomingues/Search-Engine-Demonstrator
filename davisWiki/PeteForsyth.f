Hi, Im Pete Forsyth. I am a wiki enthusiast living in http://pdx.wiki.org Portland, Oregon. I keep hearing good things about the Davis wiki, so I wanted to take a closer look at what you guys are up to! For more info, check out my http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Peteforsyth Wikipedia user profile.  Users/PeteForsyth


20090804 15:10:37 nbsp Howdy, and Welcome to the Wiki! Generally, when you want to talk to someone, you can put the comment in the comment box at the bottom of their page (like Im doing for this). The Talk pages are usually used more for discussing the contents of a page, like if there is some disagreement over what belongs in a certain page, or things like that. But again, welcome, and feel free to ask a bunch of questions if theres anything you need help with, as we are a pretty friendly bunch. Users/JoePomidor
