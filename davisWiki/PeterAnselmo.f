20061003 09:22:18 nbsp Regarding the Bicycles page, itd be nice to have pictures of all the types of bicycles. Would you want to upload a picture of your trials bike to the page? Users/KaiTing

20061021 16:04:30 nbsp You should probably consider uploading your picture/logo as a jpeg rather than a GIF. GIF doesnt compress photographs that well and restricts your gamut to 256 colors. A correctly compressed jpeg will have a larger gamut and will probably be smaller. Users/WilliamLewis

20061214 22:09:54 nbsp Probably one of the best trials riders in Davis according to my roommate Jason Antognini Users/KrisFricke

20061214 23:21:09 nbsp Well, lucky for my status, theres not too many trials riders in Davis to compete with Users/PeterAnselmo

20070318 01:00:19 nbsp Congrats! Users/DavidGrundler

20081107 10:57:25 nbsp Why is the http://daviswiki.org/Purves_and_Associates?actiondiff&version213&version112 comment you removed not relevant to the business? Users/JasonAller

20081107 15:48:35 nbsp Howdy! Re: purves and all that, I think that someone who wants to find out more about their business is probably not going to think about checking the campaign contributions page. Since it is information that I could actually see affecting peoples decisions on where to take their business, it seemed worthwhile to have it on the page. Users/JoePomidor
