20140813 23:26:04 nbsp Howdy, Peter.  Anybody can edit anything on the wiki.  If you want to create a new page, try searching for some key words (to make sure it doesnt already exist), and then do a search for the title you want to create it under, and click create a new page with this title.  I noticed theres already a (very bare) Scuba Diving entry, which may be a starting point to work from. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, jw.dw@timewarp.org
