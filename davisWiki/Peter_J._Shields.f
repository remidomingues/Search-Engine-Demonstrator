Peter J. Shields (4 April 186228 September 1962) was a Sacramento judge, cow breeder, and one time secretary of the California State Agricultural Society. His mother, Elizabeth Shields, http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85066387/19030927/ed1/seq22/ was a wellknown orchardist in Sacramento County.  He is notable in Davis for his efforts to establish the UC Davis Campus. He helped fight for funds and wrote the bill that ultimately led to the universitys creation.  This successful bill was preceded by two unsuccessful versions in which Shields had focused on the creation of a specialized dairy school as opposed to a generalized farming school.  Shields strongly believed that an inland region such as Yolo County, as opposed to the Bay area, should become home to an agricultural education center.  Although the bill entailed the creation of a commission that would decide upon a suitable town, Shields entered in lastminute stipulations at the behest of a coauthoring Yolo senator, which greatly increased the likelihood of Davis being picked as the university site.

The University honors him in several ways:
 Shields Library
 Peter J. Shields Avenue (and therefore the Universitys address One Shields Avenue)
 Shields Oak Grove in the Arboretum
 Peter J. Shields scholarship
 He was also given an School of Law LLD degree from the University
