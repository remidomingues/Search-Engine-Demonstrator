Peter is Davis secondmost famous inventor, after wiki:WikiPedia:Paul_Moller Paul Moller of Moller International (Peter bristles at the comparison, pointing out that Paul didnt actually build his craft, and it doesnt work yet, while Peter has built over a hundred of his vehicles). Peter is the creator of the whymcycles Whymcycle. He pays for this habit by being a substitute teacher at the Davis Joint Unified School District DJUSD. Hes a reallife wiki:WikiPedia:Wallace_and_gromit Wallace. Like Wallace, he is eminently friendly and always happy to discuss his projects and let kids ride them wherever he is found. Hes currently building a large bicycle sculpture for the new Explorit Science Center building. He works out of his garage in his West Davis house.
