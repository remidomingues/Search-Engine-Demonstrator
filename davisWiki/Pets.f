Pets:  Some people cuddle their beloved critters, some people toss their grubby hamsters in smelly cages, some sun their lizards in a perfect replication of the Hawaiian islands.  Others just spoil their cats or dogs.  Regardless, Davisites love their pets. Need Natura Pet Products food or supplies? Try Pet Stores. Have you lost a pet? Report it at Lost Pets. Sick pet?  Weve got veterinarians.  Theres also support for those whove had a pet pass away.  Check out the Pet Loss Support Hotline.  Theres always Pet Sitting, if you need someone to care for your little bugger when youre away. Pet transportation services will get your pet where it needs to go, while pet grooming will make it look better when it gets there.  If you dont already have a pet, and you think youd make a good pet owner, consider Adopt a Pet adopting a pet. It is also responsible to think about how you would provide for your pet Disaster Planning for Pets during an emergency.
