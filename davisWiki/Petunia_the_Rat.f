Petunia is a Pets pet who lives with Users/SharonZimmerman Sharon and Users/AmyZimmerman Amy Zimmerman, as well as with Users/ScottBiggart Scott Biggart. More importantly she lives with Endora the Rat.

Petunia was added to the family in early April of 2005. She is very small compared to the size of Endora. At first the two didnt get along but then Sharon smeared cream cheese on both of the rats foreheads and they licked it off each other and then liked each other (or at least how each other tasted).
