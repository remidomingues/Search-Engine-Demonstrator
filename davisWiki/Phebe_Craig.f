Originally from Colorado, she spent her student years in Berlin, Brussels, and San Francisco.  She has earned a reputation as a versatile virtuoso chamber musician and recitalist and has performed and recorded with many early music ensembles.  As a specialist in basso continuo realization she has accompanied many prominent early music soloists.  She has appeared at the Carmel Bach Festival, the Regensburg Tage Alter Musik, and the Berkeley Early Music Festival.  In addition to performing with many local ensembles, Craig also belongs to New York State Baroque.  She teaches at UC Davis and is on the faculty of numerous summer workshops.

Phebe is accessible, patient, humble, and quirky.  Knowledgeable about all things Baroque, she helps her students engender that quaint but bizarre period in their musical performance.  She is particularly amused by Louis XIVs vanity regarding his shapely legs.
