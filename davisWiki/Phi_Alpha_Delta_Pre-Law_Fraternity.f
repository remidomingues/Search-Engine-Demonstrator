Phi Alpha Delta (PAD) is the first and only Coed Professional Law Students PreLaw Fraternity on campus. The purpose of this fraternity is to help students make an educated decision about law school and learn more about the legal profession. As members, we strive for both professionalism and fraternalism, keeping in mind our goals and aspirations while also maintaining strong bonds as fraternity brothers and sisters.

For Winter and Spring 2013, PAD had the highest cumulative GPA of all reporting fraternities and sororities on campus. In addition, it had both the highest Winter and Spring 2013 Quarter GPA and Cumulative GPA of all reporting, unaffiliated fraternities and sororities on campus.
