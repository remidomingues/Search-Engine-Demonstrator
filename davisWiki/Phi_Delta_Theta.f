Phi Delta Theta is a Fraternities fraternity represented on the UC Davis campus by the http://www.phideltatheta.org/student/content.aspx?itemStudents/california%20epsilon.xml California Epsilon chapter. Since its association with Phi Delta Theta in 1954, the fraternity has initiated over 800 members into its ranks.

Phi Delta Theta is a fraternity organized with three principle objectives: the cultivation of friendship among its members, the acquirement of a high degree of mental culture and the attainment personally of a high standard of morality. Phi Delta Theta looks to establish itself as a positive force in the lives of its brothers and the community in which it resides. The newly rechartered fraternity is seeking to establish a positive reputation and improve the public perception of the Greek Life Greek System at UC Davis as a whole.

Phi Delta Theta is actively engaged in giving back to the community in an number of ways. One is with its ongoing project named Friday Afternoon Rectitude Time. On Fridays you will find members of Phi Delta Theta working in the garden of the United Methodist Church on Anderson. There, in the community garden, Phis grow and harvest crops that are donated to the Food Bank of Yolo County. This past Halloween, the fraternity turned their chapter house into a haunted house, and raised money for Davis Joint Unified School District local schools. Phi Delta Theta also is involved yearround in raising money for its national philanthropy ALS (also known as Lou Gehrigs Disease, named after an alumnus of the fraternity).

While doing all of these things, Phis still find time to have fun. Somehow finding time to throw parties and mixers with other Greek/nonGreek organizations.

Phi Delta Theta recruits yearround, and is always looking for quality men to join our brotherhood. For more information, find us on facebook, or email us at pdtcalep@gmail.com

Phi Delta Theta is a part of the InterFraternity Council and is a strictly antihazing fraternity.

 Membership 

Phi Delta Theta prides itself as a leadership fraternity, and it has a strong presence in ASUCD, especially in Picnic Day. However, you can find its brothers all throughout campus including: UC Davis Football, Rugby, Camp Kesem, Sports Clubs, Intramural Sports, and a large variety of other student clubs and organizations.

Additionally, the chapter has the most extensive alumni network at UC Davis reaching back even to its prePhi Delta Theta days as the Calpha Fraternity. Phi Delta Theta alumni are extensively engaged in the chapters current activities as advisers and mentors to the brothers. The alumni association recently raised over $1 million for the rebuilding of the new house.

One notable alumni from the early years of the fraternity is Colby Babe Slater, gold medal winner in 1920 and captain of United States Rugby Team at the 1924 Olympic Athletes Olympic Games. NFL Quarterback J.T. OSullivan is a former president of the California Epsilon chapter.

Nationally, famous Phis include Neil Armstrong, Frank Lloyd Wright, Benjamin Harrison (the 23rd President of the United States), Roger Ebert, Burt Reynolds, Adlai Stevenson (the 23rd Vice President), and Lou Gherig.

Phi Delta Theta is a diverse organization, and its brothers come from many different ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic backgrounds. Many different religious and political beliefs are represented as well as a variety of lifestyles. The Fraternity feels that a diverse brotherhood focused on the three principle objectives is beneficial to the development of its members as well as providing a global perspective while living in Davis.

 House 


UCDs chapter is located at its 336 C St. house. The Fraternity owns one of the largest houses in the city located in the middle of downtown, walking distance from Campus, right across from Central Park, and adjacent to Yolo Berry Yogurt. The house was originally built as a church in the late 19th century, and was soon bought out and expanded by the Fraternity. The house also sports a large backyard, which the fraternity uses for sports and other events.

The house is unique among the Greek system in that it is a dry house  no alcohol is stored or consumed at the Phi Delt house (this is a national policy that has been in place since 2000). This, along with the fact that the Fraternity owns the house, allows for a cleaner house with less maintenance requirements, as well as lower insurance costs for all its members. Partially because of this, Phi Delta Theta prides itself as one of the cheapest social fraternities without compromising the ability to have amazing events.

 History 
On October 28th, 1912, students at the University Farm founded the Calpha Agricultural Fraternity an organization that would eventually evolve into the current California Epsilon Chapter of Phi Delta Theta. Calpha was one of the original eight fraternities founded at UC Davis, back when the university was an extension of Berkeleys Farm School, and is the only one of those original eight still in operation today. In 1914, the fraternity purchased the property at 336 C St., which the Fraternity still owns today. The Calphas expanded the house to its current size during the late 1930s. When the campus closed during the World War II Second World War, so did the fraternity, and the house was temporarily converted into a barracks for the US Army Signal Corps who used the campus during that period.

In 1954, Calpha was the last of the local fraternities to have survived and retained its independent status. However in face of growing competition from the presence of the Greekletter fraternities, the Calphas decided to affiliate themselves with a national fraternity. At the time, the University had placed a moratorium on new fraternities on the campus, and so Calpha was the only opportunity in the near future for a fraternity to establish at UC Davis in the forseeable future. After much deliberation and proposals from a number of Fraternities, Calpha decided to become the California Epsilon Chapter of Phi Delta Theta.

In 2000 a http://archives.higheredcenter.org/hecnews/events/000414a.html member became the first UC Davis student in 95 years to Tragic events die of alcohol poisoning.  At this time, the chapter was already on campus probation for drinking and hazing problems.  Eventually, in 2006, the charter was pulled (a member cited financial issues as the reason) and the chapter was officially closed.

During the 2010/2011 academic year, Phi Delta Thetas Expansion Director at the General Headquarters decided to start up again with an entirely new group of men. During the fall of 2010 Phi Delta Theta had 14 members when it was an interest group. In spring of 2010, Phi Delta Theta colonized with 52 members. On November 12, 2011, Phi Delta Theta received its charter back marking a full return of the fraternity. As the fraternity approaches its 100th anniversary on the Davis Campus, the newly reestablished chapter boasts a large, involved membership, an active and supportive alumni network, and is looking forward to a bright future on the Davis campus.

In September 2012, the fraternity tore down its house in preparation for the construction of a new chapter house. See the aggie article http://www.theaggie.org/2012/10/15/phideltathetahousedemolished2 here. The new house opened on September 15, 2013.


I believe they are not on campus any longer as their charter was taken away from their national organization. Users/DanielFriedman
   They are listed at the national site, although their website is down and they arent listed at the ucdavis.edu list of groups.  Did they expire? Users/JabberWokky jw

20060721 17:44:52 nbsp During HB2K5 when the MedEvac Helicopter was landing on Slaughterhouse Island to give emergency care to the person who drowned, all of the boats respectfully and somberly stopped the music on their boats and kept hardcore partying to a bare minimum during the crisis. All that is except two boats docked very close to ours who just happened to be the Upstanding Gentleman of this house. I have never been so ashamed of another person or the Greek system in my life. Havent met any since then but the ones I did meet. egh... Users/JonathanNasca
