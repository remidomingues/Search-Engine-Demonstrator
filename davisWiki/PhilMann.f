Welcome to the Wiki!
 to be completely honest,  the second you enter Burger and Brews page, it says right there in flaming letters
no split checks. And I found it overly excessive that you wrote no split checks in at least 5 different lines.
Just my opinion man, you can go ahead and put it back if you want to, but I think people understand from the flaming letters that burger and brew does not split checks

20110616 18:04:53 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki!  Believe me, Im not a fan of the no split checks thing.  Its an idiotic policy that keeps me from going there any time Im picking a place to eat with more than 4 people.  But its already on the page once as http://daviswiki.org/Burgers_and_Brew?actionFiles&doview&targetNOSPLITCHECKSSON.png huge flaming letters; a second time IN BOLD AND ALL CAPS; and 9 more times in the comments (not including your comment or the replies, or the 28 times its mentioned in the archived comments).  We dont need to add it 7 more times in the main entry.  The entry is, after all, about Burgers and Brew... not about their check splitting policy. Users/TomGarberson
