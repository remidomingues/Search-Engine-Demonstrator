Im a recent graduate of UC Davis with a BS in Mathematics.  I love photography, programming and learning.

I have a LiveJournal which is at http://livejournal.com/~codetoad.  I dont seem to update it as much as I should, though.  Ive also got a http://flickr.com flickr (photosharing site) account at http://flickr.com/photos/philipn.  My personal website is at http://mathburritos.org mathburritos.org.  I also have a twitter account: http://twitter.com/philipn @philipn.

My email address is MailTo(philip AT localwiki DOT org). My Jabber (Google Talk) name is philip@jabber.org, and Im on that fairly often if you want to chat.

Im happy to respond to emails, but please take a look at the welcome to the wiki pages  especially the welcome to the wiki/business owner business owner page.  If you have a general question, you should probably ask it on the Wiki Community/General Discussion general wiki community page.

Also see my wiki:wikispot:Users/PhilipNeustrom home on the Wiki Spot hub.

If youd like to help out with anything related to the backend of the wiki please let me know. Theres a whole lot of work to be done!

I really like Choice Voting because its one of those ideas that, once you spend some time and think about it, makes a lot of sense.

 Some Favorite Pages 
  Night Time  Find out whats open late at night!  Literally the most important resource in Davis :P
  Davis Map  Too awesome to leave off this list.
  Cleanest Bathrooms  An idea whose time has come.
  Payphone Project  2600 31337 factor.
  Wikivangelists  I was lost and now I have found the path.
  Lost Pets
  Random Page  Good place to get ideas for pages to edit.

 What do I do on the Wiki? 
I make a lot of edits.  What do I usually edit?  These are my most common edits:
  I link phrases and terms to pages in order to add more structure.
  I remove comments and try to integrate them into the pages body if possible.  Or I move things so they complement each other more.  Bob, I couldnt agree more.. could be changed to I couldnt agree more.. and moved under Bobs comment, improving readability.
  I take differing viewpoints or arguments and attempt to find a common ground.  Nearly any argument or difference of opinion can be solved by merely expanding the writeup to be larger, more general, and less specific.  Students for an Orwellian Society is a great example (check out the revision history).
  Dont reply to someone more than once: revise your original point.

Deleting is very important, but should be done with care.

 Note to self 
Davis from the Inside Out by William D. Diemer. National housing register, 216 F Street, PMB 17.  This is an interesting compilation of a ton of Davis related information that can be purchased for $15 at Newsbeat.  Somebody ought to buy it to help out with facts/info.
    I own it. I dont have the time to spend posting all the information in it, and it does have a copyright (which I presume belongs to Bill Diemer. I guess if you have a top 5 questions for me to look up, I could get that done with reasonable celerity. Users/DougWalter
       Thanks Doug!  I just remember looking through it a while back and being surprised by the amount of potentially interesting information in it.  Moreso as a startingpoint for investigation..


20110323 18:39:07 nbsp One thing that occurs to me, since so many seem to misunderstand what the Wiki is for... a small disclaimer on the front page, top or bottom...
This site is for information and entertainment purposes only  It may prove to be very helpful.

Also, in all the discussions we have here with business owners wishing to modify their site for promotional purposes, a link that gives everyone access to the IRS agreement that keeps the wiki a true nonprofit... I have heard of this agreement, but when it comes up and discussions with business owners, no one ever seems able to find the information so it becomes more hearsay. Users/WesP

20110406 11:15:48 nbsp Sorry, bad timing on my revert; I think its worth keeping the proposal as something for people to kick around... including alternatives, like the less formal, rigid option you suggest. Users/TomGarberson

   Yeah, theres a way on the backend..but thats not enough to be worth it :)  Thankfully they were all reverted, as far as I can tell.   Users/PhilipNeustrom

20110510 15:52:27 nbsp for some reason that whole episode that just occurred reminded me of outfoxed where the guy who invented the fox news alert talked about how they made the music fast and the graphics very bright and alarming, it was for when they broke into news and delivered serious stuff! Its kinda like the community alerts page... Not detracting from Davis state of mind, and getting it votes but having it on community alert just didnt feel right {{{¬_¬}}} hence the ire Users/StevenDaubert

20110510 15:55:00 nbsp I was pretty enthralled by the discovery that when you preview a page your are about to edit you can still use the comment bar in the previewed version... It doesnt give you the edit but it puts the comment down...

I agree that its still tangential, but at least its more relevant as a direct comparison to choice voting.  If it looks satisfactory, do you want to kill the /Talk page? Users/TomGarberson

20110520 16:32:11 nbsp Hey Philip, would you be willing to throw together some Davisspecific info for the LocalWiki page?  It blows my mind that didnt already exist.  It seems like theres a lot of Davis and Wikifocused stuff that could go in there.  People involved (you and Mike), WikiSpot history, what it means for Davis Wiki (and a general idea of when), and some links, to name a few. Users/TomGarberson

  Yeah, will add when I get a chance.  Theres also not a Davis Wiki page :)
    I think Davis Wiki is pretty comprehensive.  A 1:1 scale map of the subject.  :° (whistling innocently)
     Haha.  I made a /Talk for Davis Wiki a while back to try and brainstorm some ideas, but didnt really get any bites.  It seems like itd be an interesting project, looking at what Davis Wiki means to the community.  Could turn it into an outreach thing, talking to various people, getting quotes, etc., to put there along with just basic info about history, statistics, etc. Users/TomGarberson

20110520 20:40:56 nbsp Yay!  Thanks! Users/TomGarberson

20110521 00:01:01 nbsp Philip, youve made it clear from my earliest days on the wiki that you dont like me.  I dont know why that is, so I cant change it.  But I do think I deserve a direct answer to my question; others appreciate my contributions to the wiki even if you dont. The answer that youve given is not direct. Users/CovertProfessor

   I really have no idea what youre talking about re: not liking you.  Really, at all.  Ive never notliked you or had any problem with you.  But I am sorry you feel that way.  I think you may be reading my responses to you in a tone where I dislike you (at least thats the impression I get from your comment here).

   I added a bit to my response.  If it doesnt answer your question then please let me know whats lacking.  Users/PhilipNeustrom
    I am sorry if I have misread your interactions with me, and glad to hear that you do value my contribution to the wiki.  I will continue to try to clarify my question.   Users/CovertProfessor

you would earn seeing an edit conflict then! Users/StevenDaubert

20111212 14:19:58 nbsp Hey, sorry, I didnt realize the test Sacwiki page wasnt really supposed to be passed around yet. My apologies! I thought based on our conversation about getting edit parties together (including, potentially, in Davis), it was something I should be getting people into. Sorry...Should I take down mentions of the site until its officially up? Users/NicholasBarry

20111230 13:45:34 nbsp Ok, will do.  In this case, I didnt actually realize it was a bug  I thought I might be doing something wrong.  But I will be more attuned to possible buggy behavior in the future. Users/CovertProfessor

20120111 00:26:09 nbsp would it be plausible to make a shoutbox style functionality that sits in the big black space between the logo and the user name? Like 46 lines of text big? Maybe functionality for PMing active users?

  If by broken, people mean often brings up an error message, that happens to me pretty often as well.  I can usually get the search to go through after a reload or two.   Users/CovertProfessor
  sometimes it throws the bad link code, and that goes away with a cople refreshes. Other times it stalls out and never even gets to the database Daubert
    Yeah, it happens all the time, unfortunately.  The error usuaully occurs when a search happens /while/ a new page edit is being added to the search index, so during periods of highedit activity its more likely to happen.  Users/PhilipNeustrom
      Here is a recent error.  It did not appear to coincide with an edit; the most recent edit had been six minutes earlier.   Users/CovertProfessor

20130219 11:55:03 nbsp The UX32VD Zenbook.  I think it came in an older and newer version. Older had 4 gb of RAM (two soldered in, and a stick of 2), but 32gb of SSD, and it was really popular to wipe Win8 and install Win7 on the SSD (relevant http://forum.notebookreview.com/asus/672616guideux32vdhowinstallwindows7integrated32gbssd.html thread).  Mine came with 6 gb of RAM surprisingly (stick of 4 instead of 2), but only 24gb of SSD space.   I had already bought http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item20226322&Tpk20226322 this 8 gig stick, bringing me to 10gb.  Install of the new OS was somewhat tricky; need to do it off a flash drive, and you need to get the USB 3.0 drivers for the USB first. Took the IT guy a few hours to fiddle with it, something about the drives confused him but I dont remember the issue.

Im pretty happy with it.  Its the only ultrabookclass with a real graphics card, which is nice, and its plenty powerful.  Doesnt get too warm.  Easily manages to hook up to my 24 monitors, as well as my 40 tv.   I have had a few issues:  sound drivers in the first few months, I may have originally got the wrong ones for Win7.  The sound would occasionally turn off, and I had to reset the computer.  This seems to be fixed, I think a Win7 update at some point managed to resolve that.   The sound itself is pretty decent for this laptop.  Only thing is the speaker grills are on the bottom sides and face outwards.  On a table, the sound bounces back and sounds nice.  If you pick it off the table and put it on your lap (if youre on the couch) the sound faces away which is slightly odd.

Weight is great, the size is fine.  I would probably prefer a 14, but really, if Im going to use it for any extended period of time Id hook it up to a monitor or two.  I did buy a usb 3.0 hub, to help ease the plug situation.

The keyboard itself is fine. No issues with the typeytypey. The touchpad is the only gripe.  The firmware update helped a lot, but I think I need to disable some of the gestures  either I need to be more careful when using it casually, or its a bit too sensitive. I find I keep resizing webpages when I mean to scroll.  I do most of my work on a desktop setup, so its something that I need to practice on (last laptop I used regularly had a solid button at the bottom, so Im using to leaving a thumb sitting there, meaning any scroll becomes a pinch).

Its mostly being used by my SO for casual usage, I havent actually put it to much of a major test for my own work stuff, mostly due to computers here being more powerful for our biotech analysis.  Running hours of streaming video was fine, it didnt heat up to the point where I felt I should use a cooling pad.  I havent installed any games on it yet to play with that.

20130624 20:00:24 nbsp A 20year resident of Davis and enthusiastic user of the wiki, I just moved to Caguas, Puerto Rico, and have just created a wikispot for my new town of residence. Although there are many English speakers here, I was wondering what the current state of affairs was regarding bilingual wikispots. This wiki would fill a gaping hole in easilyaccessible, local knowledge on this island, and a simple way to navigate between English and Spanish pages would be amazing.

Furthermore, addresses on this island tend to be very sketchy. Is there any way that a standard field for GPS coordinates could be added to the wiki template?

I will be starting medical school soon, but there is a large amount of local information that is passed down informally to each incoming class at the medical school, and I would like to not only incorporate all of this information, but leverage my classmates and open the wiki to the community at large.

Thanks,
Eric Users/EricWecker
