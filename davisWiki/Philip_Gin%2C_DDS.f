20050906 10:19:33 I had a horrible experience with this dentist just trying to set up an appointment.  I didn’t even get in to see him before I realized what a jerk he was.  He was extremely rude and hung up on me.  Apparently my insurance wasn’t good enough for him. I would not recommend this dentist to anyone!!!!  I think customer service should be mandatory.you know since your providing a service and all!!!!!! Users/PatDay

20051007 10:11:05 nbsp On the contrary, I thought he was a good dentist. I found that he was  affordable low prices for SHIP compared to other dentists. Unlike my previous dentist he was straight forward about what was needed. No gimmicks & stuff, definately not a salesman. I thought he did a great job.  Users/ErikaMiller

20051202 13:54:24 nbsp I had a very similar experience.  I called in and a man with a heavy accent answered the phone.  After asking what insurance I had, he asked me to call back tomorrow.  When I asked him why, he responded that he was busy.  I assume this was the dentist.  I just have to ask why he doesnt have an admin.  I have a good PPO insurance plan, so Im not sure what his problem is.  I would definately think twice before going here. Users/DjzayValenta

20060322 16:21:03 nbsp I called as a new client, and after he took my info I started to ask about appointment times.  He said I give you the appointment time and you live with it.  Unfortunately, hes the only provider for Cigna Dental in Davis, so Im going to Sacramento for dental appointments... Users/TonyBraim

20060828 14:44:38 nbsp I went to Dr. Gin for a check up. He gave me an xray and an exam, and immediately sent me off with a referal to an endodontist (and boy did I need it, he was right about that). When I got my Delta Dental bill, he had charged $77 to Delta for a cleaning he didnt do. I called him and with no fuss said I was right and he would contact Delta. Check your statement carefully! Also, he kind of creeped me out and recommended much more work than the dentist I decided to go to instead Users/LuisdelaTorre

20061205 10:55:43 nbsp I didnt think he was a bad guy, just a little creepy I guess.  He is very specific about what he wants you to do, which was nice.  He didnt say I needed any unnecessary proceedures, but the cleaning I got wasnt that good.  I dont think Ill be going back. Users/MicheleTobias

20070226 12:38:22 nbsp DO NOT USE THIS DENTIST! Cannot share confidential info, but suffice it to say, I will never allow any friend or family go see him. Users/MuffIn

20070323 11:28:17 nbsp I went to a party last night and was talking to two other people who, including myself, believe that this dentist is awful. I had a normal check up, which usually takes 45 mnutes to an hour. After 20 minutes of doing practically nothing he said I was done. I just made an appointment to see another Dentist and I have to have two teeth pulled and have a cavity! OK, so the first appointment was a little while ago, but maybe if he had spent more time looking at my teeth than taking my money, I wouldnt have to have this work done.   Users/GabeDavis
  Ive never used this dentist, but wow, Ive never had a dentist appointment last 45 minutes; 1520 minutes sounds pretty normal to me.

20070413 12:33:07 nbsp I also had a horrible experience in 2006. Till this day, I cannot ever forget. If anyone has dealt with him, and have experienced a medial fiasco, please feel free to contact me.  Users/PeterPaik

20070413 12:54:47 nbsp I apologize my contact information is as follows: peter.paik@gmail.com Users/PeterPaik

20070413 13:44:07 nbsp OK, so 45 minutes to an hour could be an exaggeration, but my point is that normally when you have a routine cleaning, you leave feeling like your teeth are clean. When Dr. Gin was done with his cleaning, I literally asked him is that it?. Not because Im a sadist, but becasue I did not feel that he had done a good job.   Users/GabeDavis

20070717 16:25:55 nbsp Ill never go here again.  He cleaned my teeth with a water spray that mostly got in my face, stabbed my gums with the metal thing then pushed me out the door after 15 minutes.  This combined with my no cavities from merely an xray and a look made him pretty terrible.  On the way out I was merely amused by the The HMO pays me only $2.87 an hour (less than minimum wage) so dont expect me to welcome you or your insurance.  What the??? Users/DarcyKato

2007911 10:10:54 Do not go here. My comment is the exact same as above (Darcy) except that he was cooking lunch in the microwave in between the Xray and the so called cleaning. My whole visit was 15 minutes long. He had me fill out paperwork in the dental chair and threw the Xray bib over my paperwork that was in my lap and told me to finish it later. I also found it odd that there were no admin assistants or hygeinists. It was really shady. Dentists generally dont make me nervous, but I definitely had my guard up since Im a female and it was just him and I. I dont care that insurance doesnt pay him enough. How is that my fault?Users/EricaMacGregor

20071023 11:05:15 nbsp This dentist is totally shady  I went to him about 2 years ago, and I think he only pretended to do xrays.  Also, the cleaning was not very thorough.  The Dr. definitely care more about what kind of insurance you have than your teeth.  I have Delta Dental and wrote to them to complain about him.  I have never gone back and would never go back. Users/AcMach

20080813 I have gone to this dentist twice (i picked him randomly from my Delta Dental options) and went for a teeth cleaning, all was fine. Then I was due for another and happened to read all these wiki comments and was horrified i had to go to him again! Buthe was very nice, had an interesting conversation with me, is VERY specific about what you should do in the office (e.g. put your belongings on the black chair and sit on the brown chair), but overall seems nice and did a fine job. i dont know if id feel as comfortable if i needed a lot of work done, but i guess you never really know anyway...also got notice from delta that i owed the dentist for fluoride, but called him up and said they didnt charge for it, so no problem there.

20081017 16:34:24 nbsp I had a similar experience with this guy and also heard of another guy whose wife had a bad experience.  It was about 3 years ago and I called him to make an appt. I had just switched to him from another dentist I had a bad experience with.  I called to make an appt. and he said my name was not on his list of patients, and I said I had just switched.  I told him I needed a filling replaced because the last dentist pulled it out.  He said,  Go back to the old dentist.  I said. I dont want to she was mean. Then he said Im mean, Im mean, I am going to call them and tell them I dont want you for a patient. Then he hung up.  One of my neighbors at the time said his wife had some work done on her teeth and he really botched it up..and at the time I hadnt even told him the guys name, we were just talking about dentists.When he told me his name , I said,Thats the one.   That neighbor said that he was unsure of the guys credentials and that he didnt have an assistant which is what the comments on here seem to confirm..  I definitely do not recommend this guy.

20100422 11:36:54 nbsp I went to this dentist and I have to say that it was pretty darn shady. For one, the dental certificates on the walls look like something printed off any old computer. They were very nice and gentle during my exam and cleaning, BUT it only took like 15 minutes for everything and then they told me my teeth were great. I swear they only took one xray and called it a full mouth exam. Regardless, I wanted to give them a second chance and when I went to schedule another appointment 2 months later for a tooth that was causing me a lot of pain, their phone was disconnected. I went to another dentist and found out that I needed 3 fillings!! I should have just gone with my first impression. It was a waste of time and money. Users/LuvMyPets
