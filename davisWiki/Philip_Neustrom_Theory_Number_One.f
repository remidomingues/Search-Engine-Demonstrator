Image(present.jpg, right, thumb, 300, Current Data showing nearconstant trend)Philip Neustrom finally hit 10,000 edits on the Davis Wiki with the posting of a photo to the Sidewalk Crack Project Davis Sidewalk Crack Project.  It is important to note that this was the first theory in the new field of Philip Neustrom Theory Neustromnomic theory.


It appears, at his current rate of edits, that he will reach this number in about two months. However, in July 2006, Philip appeared to be two months away from reaching the same value. What happened? As each day passes, Philip does fewer and fewer edits, and in the last 8 months has been editing fewer and fewer pages, and as a result the milestone has always appeared to be several months away. The purpose of this page is to explain this strange phenomenon.

Samples of the User Statistics page archived by the http://webarchive.org WayBack Machine were used to gather past statistics, and an almostdaily record of edits is currently being gathered.

And Philip is NOT allowed to edit this page to preserve the quality of future data.

 The Philip Neustrom Theory 

def.  There is a maximum possible number of edits that Philip Neustrom can make on the Davis Wiki.Image(asymptote.jpg, right, thumb, 300, Is there a limit to the number of edits?)

As he approaches this number, N, his editing rate decreases so that he approaches this number http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptote asymptotically, but never actually reaches it. The main question is whether this theoretical maximum lies above, below, or is equal to 10,000. Secondarily, it would be useful to pinpoint the reason for this phenomenon, so other wiki denizens can accurately predict and anticipate when we should all congratulate him on reaching such an incredible number of edits.

 Some Calculations

 Proposed Explanations 

 Feedback 

Philip does not want to reach a certain number, perhaps 10,000, and so the closer he gets, the more he dissuades himself from editing. If true, then we may observe an increase in Philips edits per day as he accepts that he may have to reach 10,000 edits someday. Seeing this page might cause such an acceptance of the inevitable to occur.

 Philip Clones 

A variant of this feedback hypothesis is that as his account gets closer and closer to 10,000, he utilizes clones  accounts that he has created and used over time, similar to Sockpuppets. Thus, he may actually be editing as frequently as before, but doing most of those edits with the other accounts.

 Distraction 

Image(2006.jpg, thumb, right, 400, A closer look at 2006.)Other projects are taking up Philips time, and as time (t) increases, his number of distractions increases (or involvement in those distractions). Thus, his number of edits per day will continue to decrease. This explanation is compatible with the idea that there is an asymptote, and also the possibility that there is none at all. (There may be a maximum amount of distraction keeping his edits per day from declining below a certain threshhold.) It gains support from the fact that during the Summer of 2006, his edits per day first began to decline. However, there is a lack of data points during the fall of 2006 to determine whether this decline was actually sudden or gradual. If at some point one of these distractions end, we may see a sudden and sharp increase in his edits per day.

 Kstrategy 

The Davis Wiki can only support a certain number of edits (K), such as how many members of a species can be supported by an ecosystem http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kstrategy (click here for r/K selection explanation). As N approaches K, the rate of mortality of those edits gets closer to the rate of reproduction, and the population of edits approaches the maximum (K) more and more slowly. This explanation gets extra points for nuttiness, but it gains support from the fact that initially, Philips edits have been pretty constant at about 912 edits per day on average, and did not start its major decline until the edits were getting closer to the proposed maximum. If true, we may someday observe that if there is a major catastrophe or other wiki environmental change, Philips edits may actually decline and approach a new value of K.

20070319 15:36:53 nbsp If you look at http://daviswiki.org/PhilipNeustrom?actionuserinfo Philips userinfo, you can get more data points.  Just look at the offset attribute in the URL and count em up! Users/BrentLaabs

20070319 15:41:46 nbsp Wow ... someone either has too much time on his hands or has Gay Community a thing for Philip. Users/KaiTing

20070319 15:44:58 nbsp LOL, too much time. I noticed last summer that he was close to 10,000, and then all of a sudden he wasnt going to reach it. Users/KarlMogel

20070319 15:54:50 nbsp I nominate this page as the next featured page!  Good times! Users/DavidGrundler

20070319 15:57:56 nbsp I propose an experiment: we make a whole bunch of minor mistakes on a bunch of pages and wait to see how long it takes him to overcome the slump and hit those pages till it pushes him over 10k. Users/WesHardaker

20070319 16:25:52 nbsp As a comparison, Id recommend you do the same treatment to Users/JasonAller. His contributions seem to be going at a steady pace, if not more rapid recently. This page is reminding me that someone should update the Wiki Demographics page. I have my old data file should someone want to use it as a startingpoint. Users/CraigBrozinsky

20070319 16:35:28 nbsp I have noticed the gap between them get smaller. Ill take a look. Users/KarlMogel

20070319 19:49:57 nbsp I dont think philips edits can approach any value _asymptotically_ unless there can be a nonintegral number of edits.  Otherwise he couldnt go above 9,999 edits without reaching or passing 10,000. Users/KenjiYamada

20070319 20:53:16 nbsp Shhh! Ahem, so youre saying that decimal edits are possible? Perhaps instead, an open editing window will sit on Philips screen and get closer and closer to being saved without actually being saved. Users/KarlMogel

20070319 21:34:48 nbsp Maybe Philip knew he couldnt hit 10k so at an early point he created a clone (Jason) to handle all other edits near the point he got to 10k.  The question is, whos the third clone?  Ok.  Im officially procrastinating other things if Im coming up with theories like this. Users/WesHardaker

20070319 22:43:03 nbsp Things can change aymptotically in natural systems all of the time.  If temperature aysmptotically approaches a value, it still takes discrete steps as energy is quantitized.  In terms of the clone, I nominate Users/AlphaDog.  Can you say for sure that Users/AlphaDog isnt really Philip? Users/BrentLaabs
  Great Caesars ghost, you may be onto something. None of us has ever seen AlphaDog and PhilipNeustrom at the same time. Philip, that grass skirt disguise might have tricked the others, but Im no fool! :)  Users/CraigBrozinsky
  20070320 22:57:39 nbsp Judging by the wiki:wikipedia:Drop_shadow dropshadows behind his photos alone, there is no way AlphaDog is Philip. Users/MikeIvanov
