Philip Neustrom Theory Number Two is a Philip Neustrom Theory Neustromnomic theory  that states that the Title Index total number of entries on the DavisWiki and the User Statistics number of edits that Philip Neustrom makes will be roughly in par with each other.  The number of edits that Philip has made seems to be slightly ahead, leading one to the simple conclusion that Philips edit count is a leading indicator of the number of total entries.  Should, through some mechanism not yet understood, Philips edit count ever decrease, it would be a portent of inverse growth of the wiki, a situation to be avoided at all costs.

Conclusions and recommendations:  Since the well being of the wiki is tied to Philips edits, a certain percentage of donate funds should be diverted from system payments and reallocated to Red Bull purchases.  This can ensure Philips continued activity on the wiki and a beneficial situation for all in the community.
