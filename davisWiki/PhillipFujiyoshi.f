20111228 19:52:20 nbsp It sounds like youve fallen for a common lie. On Take Back Our Democracy, you state that Citizens United grants corporate personhood. Corporate personhood predates the decision by hundreds of years its current form is largely based on wiki:wikipedia:Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad, which is 125 years old. Only someone who has not read http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08205.pdf the decision would make such a blatantly false statements. I think if you read it, youll find there are tons of other lies being told about the case

I am totally opposed to any attempt to nullify Citizens United so I wont attempt to correct this mistake. But, if you dont remove that lie from the wiki soon, I will do it for you. Edit: Toms edit calling out this lie works, too. Users/WilliamLewis

20111229 18:31:45 nbsp Lie is a strong word for an abbreviated assertion. Users/PhillipFujiyoshi
 An assertion of something that is emphatically NOT true and no reasonable person could when presented with the widely reported facts. An assertion that would be quickly dispelled if they read the opinion. Or if they had the slightest knowledge of the law. Why do you want to spread lies?  Users/WilliamLewis

20111229 18:49:32 nbsp As noted by Tom, Citizens United has nothing to do with corporate personhood. Rail against the case all you want, but if you are going to use that precise legal term in relation to this case where it is irrelevant, expect to be called out on it.  Users/WilliamLewis

20111229 18:49:42 nbsp Dont you have other stuff to do?  I sure do. Users/PhillipFujiyoshi

20120114 20:26:28 nbsp Im not sure what you were trying to do with the Take Back Our Democracy page.  Maybe if you explain it in more detail, I or someone else could help. Users/CovertProfessor
