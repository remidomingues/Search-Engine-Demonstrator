I am Phillip Kim.


Graduated back in 2008. Working for a biotech company now. Davis still tugs at the nostalgia heartstrings.

Former Vice President for the UC Davis Fencing Club UCD club team. Misses fencing dearly.

A favored quote, which manages to sum up my interests nicely, in that I find all aspects of things fascinating.

Scratch a circle and &#8719; peeps out. Enter a new solar system and Tycho Brahes formulae lie waiting under the black velvet cloak of space/time. But where has the universe hidden a word under its outer layer of biology, geometry, or insensate rock? Hyperion

I enjoy in particular my music (the chemical brothers, beck, !!!, and so on), art and architecture, books, learning stuff, dancing (swing and lindy in particular) technology, computer games, drawing, and adventurous escapades. I like drawing cities among other things.
