Pho is a Vietnamese noodle soup with beef.  Proper pronunciation is closer to rhyming with the word duh rather than doe.  Usually comes with a plate of fresh herbs and lime slices to toss in as you see fit.  Sometimes a bit heavy on the seasonings, depending where you go, but really good as long as youre not vegetarian or vegan.  Veg pho just isnt the same. In Davis, pho can be had at Hoa Viet, Sunrise Restaurant, Pho King IV, and at the ASUCD Coffee House; if youre in Sacramento Restaurants Sac, just head towards Stockton Blvd.

Some suggest avoiding the Coffee House pho, as the greens are wilted, broth bland, and the tofu tastes and looks odd. If youre in Berkeley, try Phos Saigon 2 at the Pacific Asian Market in wiki:WikiPedia:El_Cerrito%2C_Contra_Costa_County%2C_California El Cerrito. Unsure of what you want? Try number 22 with thin rice noodles.
