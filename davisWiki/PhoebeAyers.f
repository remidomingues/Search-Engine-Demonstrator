libraries
There are many libraries in Davis.
 The Yolo Public Library is nicer than ever after their recent makeover and has some great places to study, as well as a lovely selection of pleasure reading.
 The main library on campus is Shields Library, where you can find most subjects. Protip: the recent magazines and newspapers are in the basement.
 the library I work in, the Physical Sciences and Engineering Library, is known as a quiet place to study as well as home of all of the engineering & physical science books
 the Carlson Health Sciences Library down by the stadium/genome building, is another quiet place to study

Wikipedia
There is a Wikipedia meetup group in the Bay Area/Berkeley. Should there be one in Davis?

Food
I use the daviswiki a lot for restaurant info. Some of my favorite cheap meals in Davis:

 Chicken shwarma with fries at Sams Mediterranean  as good as any Ive had anywhere, including the middle east.
 Village bakery pizza  nom. Especially the $5 lunch special of slice + salad
 California (potato) burrito at Taqueria Davis. Consistently outstanding. I love potato burritos.
 Crispy fish tacos at El Mariachi. Hard to eat but worth the challenge. Their veggie burritos are also yummy.
 Mac and cheese from the hot food bar at the coop. Yum. Also, the veggie sushi rolls from the coop.
 orange chicken from House of Chang. A particularly good rendition of this totally bad for you chineseamerican classic.
 Salt bagel and cream cheese from Posh Bagel. A good salt bagel is hard to find. I also often order an avocado & cream cheese bagel sandwich there, which I wish they would just go ahead and put on the menu.
 tofu burger from Burgers and brew  the place gets on my nerves sometimes but their smoked tofu is delicious, as are the fries.
 California crepe from Crepeville; I love the avocado + sundried tomato combo.
 the Malibu from that new sandwich place  its like a pound of pastrami plus avocado. Nontraditional but yummy, if one is in the mood for serious meat.
 Adams Special at Delta of Venus  almost the only thing I order at DoV because its so good.
 Lamb gyro from the gyro truck on campus, which is (fortunately? unfortunately?) mere steps away from my office.
 dumplings from the chinese dumpling formerly fish & chips place
 tom kha gai from Thai Nakorn (it has cabbage, which is bizarre, but its tasty); stirfrys from Taste of Thai.
 tamales from the davis farmers market  my numberone outoftowner meal pick
 popsicles from Jaymes Fat Face
 popcorn from the Davis Varsity  while not a meal per se I am picky about movie theater popcorn, and this is not only by far the best in town but one of the best in the area.
