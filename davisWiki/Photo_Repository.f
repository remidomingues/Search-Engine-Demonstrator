This page is designed as a foster home for photos taken in Davis that dont yet have a designated homepage on the Wiki. The photos added to this page may be used freely throughout the wiki, and uploading photos to this page places them under the Copyrights Creative Commons licensing applicable to all DavisWiki information.  Try to add photos and list them by category; hopefully another page will adopt your photo soon.  Looking for photos?  Also check out the Wiki Community/Clipart Clipart page.

Adding Photos

20090131 13:57:55 nbsp The only issue with this page is that a photo has to be uploaded here, downloaded, a page created and then uploaded to the new page. An alternative would be to just upload a photo to a non existent page and insert the {{{Image...}}} and {{{Include(Seed)}}} macros? See Brooks Bicycle Saddles for an example of what Im talking about.
