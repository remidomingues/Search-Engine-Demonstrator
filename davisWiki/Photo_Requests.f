Photography is cool. Fulfilling photo requests is a great way to get out around Davis and find stuff. Sort of like a mini scavenger hunt. Following is a list of pages that link to this Photo Requests page, so its a good place to begin your hunt.  Have fun!

Some pointers: To add a photo request to a wiki page, add the wiki:wikispot:Help_with_Macros macro: {{{Include(PhotoRequest)}}}. Once you take a photo, you can find wiki:wikispot:help with images help placing images on Wiki pages. If an image is out of date, it is usually best to keep it displayed for historical purposes by just moving the image tag line to a different area of the page.

 Non Specific Items 

  Spiritual Organizations would look much better with a nonspecific to a single religion image at the top.  Something local with a panfaith connotation would be the bees knees.
