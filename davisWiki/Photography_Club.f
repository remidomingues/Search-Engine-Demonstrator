The Davis Photography Club is for photographers of any skill level.

Things we do in photography club are:
  Explore the manual controls of cameras
  Share images and techniques with each other
  Explore toy cameras and lomographic aesthetics
  Talk about gear (electronic/digital and chemical/film)
  Take trips to cool places, socialize, and then shoot everything
  Make homemade pinhole cameras for each other and play with them
  Find cool, odd cameras at flea markets and show them off to each other
  Hold fun photo competitions, akin to photographic scavenger hunts, and then socialize
  Take lots and lots and lots of pictures.
  Socialize

A stash of photos from members, is located at http://www.flickr.com/groups/77916690@N00/pool/ flickr group.

Recently, the club has not held any public meetings, outings, or events and remains fairly inactive.  You can fix this by helping to organize new events.

You also may wish to check out the  Photography Club at UC Davis for information about the student photography club on UC Davis campus.

 How the Club works 
  General Information is here on the wiki
  Discuss and Plan on the yahoo groups #email email list.
  Post photos, a suggested place is on http://www.flickr.com/groups/77916690@N00/pool/ Flickr where you can tag your images to the group.
  We dont have formal meetings times, officers or any other organization beyond the 3 points above. Email the list if you have other ideas.

 Dormancy? 
No activity since 2009 found  neither on the Yahoo group nor on the Flicker pool that replaced it.  There is a website for The Photography Club Of Davis California which is currently active (as of 2013), but I dont think that is the same group.

 Last Meetings (2009)

Email List
As of 08/2007 we have a new yahoo list:
MailTo(davisphotoclub AT yahoogroups DOT com) , http://groups.yahoo.com/group/davisphotoclub
  Anyone can join
  Email any of the admins if you want to be an admin, hopefully if everyone is an admin well never lose access to the list.
  Why Yahoo Groups you ask, well yahoo owns flickr and at some point we hope they get their act together and merge a little more. As for UC Davis lists, it was to hard to keep it going with the whole needing a student to be the admin requirement, in fact thats the problem this summer.

Old list info > Club Listproc was used. If you were on the old list and want new updates, please add yourself to the new yahoo list.

20051222 02:03:50 nbsp How about taking a couple pictures of the Davis Psychic over the break? Pretty please? Users/KarlMogel

20060521 12:17:11 nbsp http://www.pbase.com/jay22000066/yosemite_trip Users/ZheXu

20070809 11:37:25 nbsp How about some photos of the club itself?  Kind of ironic that there are none on this entry.

  Ok, i posted one. Oddly enough, we dont have many shots of photo club. We get so busy shooting other stuff, we forget to shoot each other.  Will try to get more in the future though.  users/jefftolentino

20071017 23:20:33 nbsp How about a meeting Saturday Oct. 20, 2:00P.M. at Petes downtown. I think that is where the last one was. I am new to the club and I live in Vacaville so I am not that familiar with Davis but I sure I can sniff out a Petes.

I have several used computers that are capable of running Photoshop and I would be interested in donating one to the club if it would be of use.
