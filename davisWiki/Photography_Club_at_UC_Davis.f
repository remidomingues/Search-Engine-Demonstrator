About Us
The Photography Club at UCD is a Student Organizations community of students interested in photography and a space for people of all levels and backgrounds to learn about the art, science, and technology of photography. The club was established in Fall Quarter 2010 by President Lara Pede and is actively growing. Members participate in weekly “Photo of the Week” contests and club events such as photography shoots or visits to galleries. Meetings are held every week and everyone is welcome (you can come early & stay late). Members are encouraged to participate by sharing their pictures and photographic experience.

Whether you have an expensive DSLR or you use your iPhone’s camera, as long as you like photography you’re welcome to join.
