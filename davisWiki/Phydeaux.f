Named after the late Frank Zappas bus, and pronounced just like the dog (Fido), Phydeauxs blend of Americana roots music was a popular fixture among college crowds in the late 70s and early 80s. Boldly improvisational, the group drew inspiration from The Band, Van Morrison, the Grateful Dead and others. Phydeaux played main stage at Whole Earth Festival in 1978, 1979, and 1980, when they shared top billing with wiki:WikiPedia:Country_Joe_and_the_Fish Country Joe and the Fish (as a duet) and David Brower. Twentyfive years later, the band has reunited... older, wiser and better players all. The music sounds fresheven comforting in these strange times and retains the energy that made the band so much fun to dance to.
