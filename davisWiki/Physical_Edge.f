NEVER, EVER COME HERE. I had $200 stolen from my wallet out of a locker here. The management didnt call, didnt apologize, basically accused me of lying and refused to give me a refund for the personal training sessions I had left. As if I would every want to go back. I dont feel safe, I certainly dont trust anyone with in the management. The gym is small, bad equipment and in the middle of nothing. Go to the ARC, go to 24 hour fitness, go to Davis Athletic Club, go to some place where youre not going to get robbed. DONT GO TO PHYSICAL EDGE, EVER! VanessaRinggold

20070403 22:45:30 nbsp How odd...  They provide locks for customers to put onto the lockers.  Did you use one? I love this place. My experience is a lot of personal attention. It is small, with minimal restroom and changing facilities, but I find it a very comfortable environment... just the opposite of the meat market mass production of the big places.  Charges and policies are clearly posted. Poipool

20070403 21:58:15 nbsp I have received years of physical therapy... this place is good.  My therapist never lets his attention wander. He is precise in all his movements, pushes me to my limits and never beyond. They minimize the paperwork and focus on the work. Most importantly, they have a real understanding of the psychological demands in the healing process. UCD, Sutter, UCLA were good, but this place is both excellent and human. Users/Poipool

20070410 09:29:21 nbsp In regards to safety, this could have happened at any place of business and patrons should be aware of their own belongings.  I believe they have a disclaimer which states they are not responsible for lost or stolen items in their facility.  Go anywhere and they have the same policy.  I would say that Physucal Edge has a wonderful atmosphere and the staff members are not rude.  In fact, most of the fulltime staff members that have been there from the day they opened have wonderful relationships with several gym members and patients to the point that they know them by face and name and greet them outside of the work environment when bumped into on the street.

20071126 22:11:39 nbsp I agree with poipool.  The South Physical Edge on Drew Avenue is wonderful.  Everyone is there for your physical health and safety.  The people are professional and the rooms are clean.  The atmosphere isnt like a meat market.  Mind you, this is coming from a person who is hard to please: this place impressed me. Users/Reina

20080219 15:31:20 nbsp I have used the South Davis location since its opening, and have always found it to be extremely clean, and the personnel there to be very professional. I like that they provide free locks, and will hold on to the key for you while you work out. Theyre nice about changing the channels on the TV, and are also good about providing quality customer service without being annoying. Ive never used the heated pool but I hear good things about it from people in the locker room (though you should know its NOT a lap pool  for this youll have to join another gym or Davis Aquatic Masters. DAM provides special pricing for Physical Edge members). They also offer a good variety of classes. Overall Im very happy with this gym. Users/ABlack

20080329 04:47:54 nbsp I would not recommend this gym to any of my friends in Davis.  I tried to use the new facility at South Davis and was amazed by the unfriendly, thoughtless, rudeness of the clerk at the front desk.  Although I was a guest from the local Holiday Inn Express and entitled to use the gym (a fact which was confirmed by my room key and a call to the hotel), the clerk still insisted I pay $7.00 since the hotel had not given me a magic coupon.  In the end, a helpful employee from the hotel drove over and handed the officious hostess the essential coupon so I could enjoy the highest emphasis on customer service in a rather mediocre fitness center.

20080401 19:45:56 nbsp the front desk girl that used to work there was really hot. I wonder what happened to her...she was the reason I went as often as I did.  Users/nta2002

20080601 16:38:12 nbsp I thought this gym was great when I went. The young girl was really helpful and willing to answer any questions I had, and she never seemed to get annoyed after all the questions I asked. She just kept on smiling. Even after a question she didnt know she went out of her way to call someone so I could get the answer. She even cleaned while I was there and it was fairly clean to me. And to Vanessa, the gym is not small, its privately owned so its not going to be a big gym. I thought it was big when I went. All and all I was very impressed by the gym, and I will recommend it to all my friends.  Users/Davisite2075

20081010 00:38:10 nbsp I dont want to be rude to Vanessa but its your own fault, dont just leave $200 in your wallet out where someone can look. Its not the owners responsibility to watch over your stuff while you work out. They provide locks. This place is really nice, the owners are nice and I didnt bring in enough money one day and one of the front desk girls paid the 2 dollars extra. I joined the next day. They answered any questions I had. Some of the staff isnt as well informed as the rest. But I did ask a girl if she knew how to work certain muscles out, and she knew exactly what to do so I can tone up. Most know what they are talking about and have no problem leaving the desk to help you out with questions or anything. At the ARC I felt like it was an inconvenience to ask how to use a piece of equipment. But my experience there has been a good one so far. I have no complaints. They always fix things right away when asked about something bring broken like a piece of equipment or if there needs to be toilet paper put into the stalls or more shampoo. I really like the staff and the way everyone has treated me. Users/AdamDen

20100216 15:26:27 nbsp I dont know too much about physical Edge, except when I tried to make an appointment there.  They asked me if I had insurance, which I said yes, What insurance, I told them Blueshield. Then, they wanted my insurance policy number over the phone before they would even make the appointment for me.  They would not make the appointment without that.
I know they are there to make money.  However, that sounded a bit too greedy for my taste.  I decided to go to Burgers after that.  People at Burgers Physical Therapy are very friendly and the therapy is so far so good. Users/davisazip
