The Physics Building (PHYGEO) is home to Physics.  Before September 2009, it was also the home of UC Davis Geology Department Geology and was known as the Physics/Geology building. The Geology Department moved to the Earth and Physical Sciences Building.

This is one of the coolest Campus Buildings buildings on campus. The building used to be named Physics Unit I  even though there was no Physics Unit II at the time.  Delusions of future grandeur, apparently.

It is located west of Mrak Hall and was built in 1971. If you walk past the Silo, away from the Quad, with Bainer Hall to your right and the Physical Sciences and Engineering Library to your far left, Address(Physics/Geology, 38.536740, 121.751427) is right behind Roessler Hall.


 

 



 The Roof 

The roof of this building has an amazing view of the Campus. Unfortunately, the roof is locked due to a UC Davis Fire Department fire code that states that all exits on the roof must remain unlocked from the roof side so that in case of an emergency, people can quickly exit the roof. This left the door to the Penthouse (telescope storage room) unlocked and in order to prevent theft, the roof itself then had to be locked. If you want to get on the roof, youll have to attend one of the Astronomy Club at UC Davis Astronomy Clubs public events on the roof, such as public viewings and on Picnic Day:
