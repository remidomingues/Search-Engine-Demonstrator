Tutoring

The physics club often offers weekly tutoring for lower division physics classes (e.g. PHY 10, 7 and 9 series, etc.).  Stop by the club room for the current schedule.

Meetings

The club meets on Friday at 2 PM in Room 388 on the 3rd floor of the Physics Building.  Meeting times and locations change, though, as club members get busy.

Projects

The club usually has a number of physicsrelated projects going at any given time. For example, we are currently working on building a Tesla Coil. Past projects have included: a Rubens tube, a tennis ball cannon, and various other physics demos.  These are often put on display during Picnic Day and physics department gatherings.
