20050405 19:02:49 nbsp Some of my friends live here, in a two bedroom townhouse. In my opinion definitely a nice place, the carpet they got is brand new and super soft. Large living room overlooking the pool area. Easy access to Oxford Park and campus. Users/NatalieKitchiner

20050817 14:49:47 nbsp I recommend this place because its not that noisy and the managers are nice to talk to.  Users/SimonFung

20050820 23:24:28 nbsp Does anybody know if they allow more than one car per apartment to park in their lot? Users/MindyYang

20050821 12:12:24 nbsp Well if you have roommates then each of you can park your car in the lot. If you have visitor parking I suggest parking in the street to avoid towing. If that doesnt answer your question give the manager a call. She is a nice lady to talk to.  Users/SimonFung

20050822 09:51:04 nbsp They used to have REALLY high speed bumps in their lot.  It was funny since over the years they got flat tops since so many cars had bottomed out on them. Users/RogerClark

20060117 11:40:08 nbsp The management is REALLY nice.  In the beginning, they fixed things in our apartment pretty fast.  After a few months, they started lagging, but eventually if you keep reminding them every week, theyll do it.  They keep the landscape really clean.  Remember that these apartments are sort of old, so the insulation isnt that great.  I could hear my neighbors do a lot of things.  It also gets REALLY cold in the winter!  The bedrooms and kitchen are sort of small, too.  They changed their prices from high $900s to $1050 for my 2 bedroom this year. Users/MindyYang

20070327 11:36:05 nbsp The apartments are kind of old, but the 2 bedroom townhouse is nice. I know they are raising their prices again from 1050 to around 1200 for the 2 bedroom for next year.  Users/LizMelack

20080120 18:17:16 nbsp I lived in Pinon for a year, and would probably move back in again. In general, my only complaint would be management (mostly just the lady, not her husband). When they started construction on the building (like, on our roofs) we werent even warned about it. Just woke up one day with guys on our roof! Theres no 24 hour maintenance like at other complexes, so if something goes wrong, you just have to wait. On the upside, its very close to campus, and even if it looks ugly from the outside, the inside is not bad. The 2 bedroom I lived in was very spacious. Theres plenty of parking from what I could tell. Also, we were never busted for having a party, even though it seems like no one else in that complex ever partied (or even came out of their apartments). Oh, another downside, the pool is not even remotely heated, so its pretty much always freezing.  Users/Kiran

20080201 14:46:24 nbsp The apartments are decent, a little old.  I live in the three bedroom townhouse and I am mostly happy with it.  The kitchen is really small and the appliances need replacing.  The downstairs is really cold in the winter and the turning on the heater doesnt help.  The managers are really nice unless you get on their bad side.  The location is the best thing about the apartments.       Users/JennaChen

20080221 20:31:01 nbsp I live in a three bedroom townhouse and let me just say, the management could not be more unprofessional. The woman, Katie, is the RUDEST woman Ive ever met. She is rude to her tenants and condescending over the any questions you have. Ive heard her swear on several occasions. The only times she has ever been polite to me is when she is taking my money.  The only plus is that they repair things really quickly, which is nice. Users/Sienna

20080311 15:14:26 nbsp Do not live here if you want reasonable management. They are unwilling to discuss disputes and would rather threaten you with calling the police and evicting you than sitting and discussing issues in a civil manner. I have never had a problem with management anywhere in another complex.  Users/NickAntipa

20080409 10:08:25 nbsp I just have to agree with Sienna. Katie is only pleasant when you are paying rent! I went in once to complain about something (I think there was a wasps nest outside my apartment) and she just cut me off and pointed at a folder where maintanence request forms are kept!

Oh, and those trees with the red leaves/flowers/whatever outside the apartment buildings attract bees. I heard buzzing when I walked by them everyday! Users/Kiran

20090505 12:04:44 nbsp Ive stayed here for almost 2 years now, and its proximity to campus really cant be beat.  Im looking for a sublease for the summer June 14thAugust 31st.  For more details go to http://sacramento.craigslist.org/apa/1155909180.html
Perfect for Summer Sessions! Users/MattCrooks

20090509 01:06:22 nbsp Today, I visited a bunch of apartment complexes (like 10). I had high expectations for Pi単on. I seriously thought that it looked nice enough on paper that I would be anxious to lease a place from there. So, while I have never lived at Pi単on, I can recount my story of checking it out.
First, I called them a week before I got into Davis to physically check out apartments. I got this surly woman on the phone who was just short and terse about every question. It was an aggressive and aloof attitude. Whatever... maybe she was having a bad day. Everyone has their bad days, right?

At around 9:30 on Friday the next week, my dad and I went to the office and knocked on the door. We didnt see the sign saying that they only opened at 1pm. Oops, our bad! Anyway, we were greeted with a curmudgeonly woman: Uh... EXCUSE ME!!! We open at 1pm!!!. There was no Im sorry, but we dont open until 1pm. Please come back then. She was clearly awake and dressed. We hadnt woken her... we had just simply come at the wrong time. It was honest mistake so I dont know why were scolded in such a way.

She then begrudgingly asked us to quantify our desires. Um, what the heck does that mean? :
I would like THREE eggs.
I would like TWO MILLION dollars.
I would like FOUR more pairs of underwear.
I would like TEN houses on the beach.

She then condescendingly remarked that it was very funny that I am a Ph.D student and that I didnt understand her contrived and convoluted speech. And it wasnt like it was just to some lowly student standing there by himself; my father was with me by my side. My father and I were so taken aback by the fact that this lady had just outright insulted us when we were prospective customers, that we didnt know what to say.

Anyway, what she was trying to ask, in the English that everyone else speaks and understands was: What type of apartment are you looking for?.

So after we got past the hurdle of her superior English skills and intellect, she told us that she had no availability. Thats fine. Places sell out and I understand that. We asked her a few more questions. Once again, curt, unhelpful responses.
I could have considered renting a place for the year after this one, but now I definitely, definitely would not because management was so unpleasant.
We mentioned that we had one day to view apartments and sign a lease. She said that would be impossible.
I laughed a little bit to myself when I signed a lease 4 hours later at Chautauqua.

Moral of the story:

Good management is the key to a successful complex. When the managers are surly to you, even when they might be trying to sell you something, you have your first red flag. I mean, imagine how theyll treat you once they HAVE your money and ARENT trying to sell to you. My guess is like dirt.  Users/farfelu5251

20090716 17:22:40 nbsp I lived at Pinon for two years and had no problems. The management was weird, but nothing horrible to deal with. I would move back if I needed a place. Users/Air

20090822 23:48:09 nbsp in the beginning, the manager was nice but after a while, she kinda gets pretty rude with you (shes even snapped at me several times). i lived here for 3 years and it was alright, i guess. just dont go and complain about anything, katie will only cut you off, say something stupid and make you fill out a form (she doesnt even offer you a pen).

i also found rat droppings on my cutting board in the kitchen a short while after i moved in. earlier that day, i ran into her and we somehow got onto the topic of pests and she claimed that pinon had never had any issues with them. yea, right. Users/whomeno

20100512 01:18:15 nbsp I am looking to sublease. Please let me know if you want to by messaging on here. Users/HughJass

20100603 16:57:40 nbsp i was here last year and ehh.... too pricy... PLUS, the lady is pretty mean... if you want to live here. go talk to the old man. Hes really funny and nice. FYI he does all the maintenance and stuff. i feel so bad for him. But it is really close to campus. So its your choice. High price, close to campus or low price but far from campus.  Users/Hollen

20100719 02:09:52 nbsp Pretty decent place, maintenance is really bad though, one of our lights went off in the bedroom and we sent in a request and it took them over a month to do it. Our dishwasher is now broken and our refrigerator is also showing obvious wear from previous tenants as it does not stay closed all the time. However it is really close to campus and I enjoy the fact that I only need 5 minutes to bike to campus with my road bike.
   Fridge and Dishwasher got replaced free of charge I assume, well see when we move out if any of it actually comes out of the deposit or not. Also a note on the difference between pricing is.. Renovated vs. Unrenovated, the most notable feature of the renovated places is a knocked down wall that gives you more living space in the living room, also the counter tops are changed but thats something minor for me.
     Moving at this year, been a good 2 years here and I have to say that the management is pretty good, fixes most repair requests in a timely manner unless one of the appliances breaks down, they might have to replace it so that will take longer. One thing I really liked about this place was the fact that there are BEDROOM lights! Most apartments has only empty rooms in which youll have to get yourself a floor lamp of some kind if you dont want to be in the complete darkness in your room. Great place and would definitely recommend living here. I would stay an extra year if my housemates werent all moving out and finding replacements would have been a hassle. Cheers. Users/ClarenceL

20110123 12:13:34 nbsp Pinon does not charge tenants for the replacement of worn out appliances. As for the renovated three bedrooms, its quite a bit more than a knocked down wall. Anyone who would like to see for themselves are welcome do so starting Feb. 1st at 1pm when we begin showing model apartments for Fall 2011.  Users/katieLytle

20110505 16:23:29 nbsp I rented a 3 bedroom apartment at Pinon for 3 years. It is a great place to live, very close to campus, and extremely quiet. The managers are both great people, and I really enjoyed my time there.  Users/MichaelVossen

20110608 00:49:32 nbsp Does anyone know the dimensions of the actual bedroom for a 1 bed room apartment?  Users/Weesito

20120405 12:36:20 nbsp The lady who runs the management is extremely rude and mean. She is everything associated with someone who you dont want to talk to. She makes me cringe every time I walk by her. There are a lot of cockroaches, but the study room is nice. Users/NicoleWan
