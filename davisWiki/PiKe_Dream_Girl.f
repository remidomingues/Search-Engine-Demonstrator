Pi Kappa Alphas annual philanthropy event, which although is only a year old tradition, is one of the most successful social events on campus.  It is a pageant based on formal wear, talent and question/answers with competitors from most Sororities on campus.  Two years ago, it drew in more than 400 people and proceeds were donated to the UC Davis Cancer Center.  For the 20052006 school year it was scheduled to be held in midJan. at Freeborn Hall and might have had even more ladies showing off the best UC Davis has to offer.
