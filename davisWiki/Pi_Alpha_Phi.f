>History of Pi Alpha Phi<

Pi Alpha Phi was established in 1926 at the University of California, Berkeley.  The fraternity of Pi Alpha Phi was founded by six unique individuals: D. Wing Tom, Wing Chan, Elmer Leong, Chack Chan, Tim Jang, and George Lee.  Wing Chan was elected as the first President of the Fraternity.  D. Wing Tom served as the Vice President and Elmer Leong as the Secretary.  They wanted to establish an organization that would be based on the bonds of friendship, mutual experience, academic excellence and brotherhood.  The name Pi Alpha Phi was derived from the initials of the Greek phrase meaning

>To advance through brotherly ties; the thirst for learning.<

During this era, traditional Greek fraternities legally discriminated against all men of color.  Since they were banned from joining a traditional Greek fraternity, the Founding Fathers wanted to ensure that AsianAwareness would always be an important part of the fraternity.

Pi Alpha Phi is the first AsianAmerican interest fraternity. Since the founding of Pi Alpha Phi, the organization has flourished with active chapters at campuses throughout the nation.
