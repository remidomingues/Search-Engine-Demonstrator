Pi Day is celebrated on 3.14 (March 14th), often at 1:59pm.  A rather obscure and geeks geeky holiday, it is popular among scientists and at universities.  Various celebrations have been held in Davis on different years.

2007

In 2007 the Mathematics department held a pie social in celebration.

2005
These were found on the bulletin board next to the Experimental College on March 14, 2005  the same number as the first three digits of pi.  The posters claim to be affiliated with the Campus Crusade for Chaos and Confusion but have a slightly different flavor to them.  For one thing, they are less confusing.


 

There was also a poster with this nursery rhyme on it:

  Sing a song of circles a pocket near your thigh,
  Three point one four blackbirds baked in a pi.
  When the pi was opened Euler began to sing,
  Oh wasnt that a rounded dish to set before the king?
