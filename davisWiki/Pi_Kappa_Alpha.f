The Fraternities Fraternity has been at Davis since 1985 and recently celebrated their 27th Anniv. this past  March. Pi Kappa Alpha, Theta Omega, occupied 101 Russell Boulevard (formerly the Sigma Alpha Mu house) across the street from the Toomey Field football field on Frat Row/Russell) from 2006 to 2010. The fraternity will occupy the former Tau Kappa Epsilon (TKE) house as its main chapter house, which is currently being renovated and remodeled, located on 1st and A. Restorations will be completed by September 2012. Pi Kappa Alpha also hosts 3 other houses for its members located on 4th and A, Vassar Drive, and Eureka Avenue.
