Pianos are hammers and strings all sealed inside lovely painted wooden boxes.  Under the hands of a musician they make pleasant music, and can be fun even for those just noodling out a tune with a single finger.  You can contact Area Music Teachers music teachers if you want to learn how to play them.

A public piano can be found on campus inside the Coffee House against the left wall right as you go in.  There used to be a public one elsewhere in the Memorial Union but is now gone, possibly sold through Bargain Barn.

Should you want to purchase a piano, Watermelon Music carries digital pianos for sale and Craigslist often has pianos (both digital and acoustic) for sell from $0$$$$$.

If you already have a piano that is not up to snuff, you may wish to Musical Instrument Repair repair or tune it.

  My typewriter had turned mute as a tomb
  And my piano crouched in the corner of my room
  With all its teeth bared; all its teeth bared
     Nick Cave, Hallelujah
