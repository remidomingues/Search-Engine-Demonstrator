Picatsso is an escape artist. He is famous for traveling great distances when he searches for a confused sense of freedom. He has about half a tail, but no one really knows if this is the result of his adventurous nature or not.

He belongs to Users/AllanRae Al and his sister Users/ChristinaRae Christina Rae and lives at their house along with Tom (not a cat).

That cat once tore our screen door off its hinges, I kid you not. But really he is a good kitty. Users/GeoffJohnson



I am saddened to say that Picatsso the cat passed away at 8:00 am on June 7th due to vehicular murder.  Picatsso will be greatly missed by all but especially Al and Christina who had him for so many years.  Picatsso was a great kitty and was always cuddling at the foot of your bed.  He would also drink from your water cup when you werent looking but he was still a good cat. Users/AllanRae
