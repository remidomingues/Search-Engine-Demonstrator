 Day of 
add anything! Picnic Day took place on April 16^th^.  The weather was great, blue skys and not a cloud to be seen  such an improvement over the two previous years (where there was rain). Turnout looked to be high and there was a lot of activity on campus.
 The parade 
Picnic Day always kicks off with a big parade that showcases many of the organizations and groups here in Davis.













 Activities 

To the south of Hart Hall there were some great interactive events for kids. One of the more popular was a kiddy pool with a small step stool in the center. A child would be lifted to the stool and two of the event staff would raise a pair of hoola hoops from the soapy water surrounding the child on all sides with a large bubble.


At the Cole Facility Cole facility there were was a petting zoo and a chance to milk a cow or a goat.

Tomato plant seedlings were given a way at the Plant and Environmental Sciences Building.  Nearby, you could get free grapevines or taste exotic fruits.  Yum.

The UC Davis Fire Department fire department ran an open house selling tshirts and giving away sticker badges and childrens fire hats while responding to several emergency calls.

 Other Accounts 

  I spent much of the day between A Street and B Street where there were about a dozen different parties going on. I was there because the Chabad House is there. My friend Aliza, referred to this area as Picnic Days Frat Brother.  Users/KenBloom
