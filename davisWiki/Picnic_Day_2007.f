20070410 20:42:08 nbsp So, at the moment, weather.com is predicting showers for this Saturday... Users/PaulAmnuaypayoat

20070412 20:39:49 nbsp Weather.com is now predicting rain all day, with a 90% chance of precipitation.  Looks like we might get a rainout like happened a few years ago. Users/AlexPomeranz


  Weather.com is quite unreliable for this area, in my experience.  It has Woodland right now at 40% chance of showers for this afternoon (full of blazing sunshine) and 60% chance of showers tomorrow.

20070413 08:35:34 nbsp Better buy your umbrellas now, if you dont have one. When it poured in 2003, I wasnt prepared and wandered around campus and downtown for hours in the rain. Most stores sold out of their umbrellas, so I had to pay a lot of money for one at Gottschalks Users/ElleWeber

20070413 09:42:52 nbsp have faith young padawans. The sprit of picnic day will clear the skies and the sun will come out yet! Or well get wet. Users/TomAbeles

20070414 11:12:04 nbsp Its raining now... not worth it to go out as Ive missed the parade already. Users/TusharRawat

20070414 16:55:29 nbsp Are there any official stats of what percentage of picnic days get rained out? 3 out of the past 5 years doesnt seem very good... Users/AaGg

    Lets make a list!  2004, 2003, 2003?  It didnt rain in 2005 or 2006..

        So, 2003, 2004, 2007, thats not 3/5...?
              Wouldnt say 04 was rained out completely, though it did rain and cancel some things partially. And it didnt rain in 02.  So thats 2(+.5)  / 6 I guess.

20070414 17:04:13 nbsp I didnt take photos from the float this year due to the rain, but I saw a lot of cameras in the crowd. There was a delay in the parade, does anyone know what caused it? Users/JasonAller

20070414 17:05:56 nbsp 2003 was completely rained out, pretty much like today.  04 rained, but it wasnt that bad, just a drizzle on and off.  They didnt cancel everything outdoor in 2004, a lot of bands still played outside or in those covered trailor stages, iirc.  Users/EdWins

20070414 19:50:24 nbsp The delay toward the beginning of the parade was just because the walking groups were getting shuffled in from a location separate from where the floats started. Or at least that was my understanding from the limited vantage point inside the KDVS blimp gondola. Users/ElisaHough

20070414 22:50:03 nbsp Nice work with the photos and everything you guys.  I was cooped up in the bar all day so know I feel like I was really there  Users/JarrettNoble

20070415 11:54:03 nbsp so rainy, all that was left to do was drink indoors Users/mynameisbernice1

20070415 17:22:17 nbsp I was driving the double deck in the parade for Unitrans and after I had the hook and ladder fire truck pulled in front of me from the walking groups location we still got stuck way down on California forever. I was just glad I was in a bus. The campus tours people(?) who were behind me got soaked for the most part, but they did get to hang out on my bus while we were delayed. Users/TracyPerkins

20070415 20:56:08 nbsp Ive always wondered why they have Picnic Day in April (April showers) which is prime rainy season around here.  Seems like May would be a much better choice  after a lot of the rain, but before it get baking hot. Users/AlexPomeranz

     They might want to not have to compete with the Whole Earth Festival.

20070415 22:10:37 nbsp I heard the KDVS blimp escaped and the FAA was not pleased. Confirm/Deny? Users/ArlenAbraham
 The KDVS blimp was cut loose and Drake (GM) called the FAA, but they didnt seem particularly concerned. Users/ArlenAbraham
