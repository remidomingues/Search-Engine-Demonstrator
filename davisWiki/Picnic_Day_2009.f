Picnic Day 2009 is this years Picnic Day celebration fittingly titled Reflections: 100 Years of Aggie Legacy.  As usual, there will be the 150+ exhibits and special events all over campus, the parade, Picnic Day Battle of the Bands, a sledding hill with Ski Demonstrations, Davis Dance Revolution, and so much more!
