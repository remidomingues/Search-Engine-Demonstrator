20100421 21:08:30 nbsp I saw police cars all over the place, including at least one unmarked car (and a vehicle ahead of it which did not pull over even though the car had lights and sirens on!) Users/IDoNotExist

20100422 11:43:32 nbsp Serious trouble went on.  Someone threw a rock through my managers window and broke an antique picture frame. There was also a fight next door and Im sure someone got hurt.  Users/MasonMurray

20100422 22:35:52 nbsp Words cant even begin to describe the horror of working at Rite Aid, of all places, on Picnic Day.

It wasnt pleasant would be like saying that Michelangelos David is just a statue: understatement of the year.  I feel for everyone else who had to work that day, too. Users/AlexanderHo

20100422 22:40:29 nbsp What happened at Rite Aid, of all places, on Picnic Day? Users/IDoNotExist

20100423 17:26:02 nbsp I feel that the two largest problems of the day were these:
1) The lazy attitude of the bouncers at many bars allowing many intoxicated people into their establishments when they should not have. Part fo thsi is greed, part of this is just an inability to differentiate between drunk and  buzzed patrons.  This can be easily controlled.  Part of this was also the foolish bars who allowed 6am drinking deals such as the Graduate with their 1st Thousand for a dollar Beer deal.  Why do you think it is a good thing to get people hammered right at the beginning of the day?

2) The public/private drinking sponsored in large part by the Frats and Sororities.  This is the most difficult to regulate and relies entirely upon personal responsibility.

I was bouncing that day at Little Prague. We had a zero tolerance policy for allowing anyone who seemed overly intoxicated from entering and handled any issues that occurred within the establishment in a timely and respectful manner. No serious issues, no fights, no bad feelings on the part of the patrons, even when they had to take a field sobriety test to get through the door (in some cases). Most who failed the simple test laughed and said Yeah, I probably had too much and left with no hard feelings.

It is the responsibility of everyone to recognize and understand when people cannot control themselves. Users/WesOne

20100520 10:53:14 nbsp Things definitely need to be rethought next year if UC Davis students hope to keep Picnic Day around.  I had to work that night and E Street was insane.  Most of the people who came into the store where I worked were drunk, belligerent, and rude.  Families who were unfortunate enough to bring their small children in were clearly annoyed and upset with the environment and I had to clean puke off one of our tables.  Ridiculous. Users/AdamV
