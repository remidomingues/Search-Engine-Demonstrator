These students are some of the hardest working students on campus (spending ASUCD Fee money taken from students is hard work), working for months often making huge sacrifices to put on UC Davis largest and oldest tradition and Picnic Day signature event. This page is dedicated to the 96 (and hopefully more) boards of directors who have served.

Chair: Jacquelyn Kong
