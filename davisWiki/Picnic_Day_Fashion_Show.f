One of the Events each Picnic Day is a Fashion Show. Its always best to arrive early, for the event reaches the maximum number of spectators quite quickly, and hoards of people are turned away at the front doors.

20070415 13:55:29 nbsp I was there, and it was spectacular. Unfortunately I couldnt take any really good photos, but there was at least one guy with a good camera shooting pics. If I can brighten some of my pics with photoshop or something, I might try uploading later. Users/PaulAmnuaypayoat
