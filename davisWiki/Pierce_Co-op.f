PIERCE COOP (PIERCE HAUS)

living it up, crazy style since 1970something!

We take pride in our sustainable living practices as members of the On Campus Coops. At capacity, the house holds fourteen people, and were always looking for applicants. Dinner is at 7 pm, Sunday through Thursday. Youll be amazed what we can do with quinoa. Garden parties are another great time to visit and take place from 2 pm  dark on Fridays, generally starting in the South Garden, adjacent to student housing.

We try to center ourselves around sustainable living practices. Dinners are vegetarian and food that doesnt come from our gardens or the Egg Effort Coop Egg Effort Coop is purchased at the fabulous Davis Food Coop. Our rent is reasonably low compared to other housing arrangements because we have such a large family.  We also take frequent house trips, host famous Pierce dance parties, and boast the spiciest spice rack in the TriCooperatives.


Pierce is a great place to hang out, make some new friends, or learn about lowimpact living. Feel free to pick up an http://www.housing.ucdavis.edu/apply/apply_coops.asp application over at student housing or online, if youre interested in applying, and fill out a questionnaire (File(tricoop_app.pdf)) for the house to get to know you better (email that baby to tricoop@ucdavis.edu). You can also email us at piercetb14@ucdavis.edu.  We love to meet new people, so come on over!

Pierce Coop is also known farandwide for having the best cats in all of Davis.  Meet Datura, the sweetandsassy Queen of the Coops, and little Fig, her protégé!
