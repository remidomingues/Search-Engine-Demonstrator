The Pierce Miller Bicycle Collection will be displayed at the California Bicycle Museum in Davis. UCD bought the collection in 2000 with a Transportation Enhancements grant.

Pierce Miller was a Modesto rancher whose interest in the history of transportation manifested in his wideranging collection of bikes, antique automobiles and horsedrawn vehicles. The bicycles he collected were acquired from vaudevillian acrobatic bicyclist Walter Nilsson, who originally collected the bikes during his travels.
