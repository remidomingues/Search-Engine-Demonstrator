20110715 02:13:23 nbsp Ive never been one to work out, but I absolutely love going to pilates classes here.  The classes are small and you get personalized attention, and Chris is an amazing instructor.  He always shows modifications to different exercises to make them easier/harder depending on your ability.  The prices are also extremely affordable.  Users/kaylajoy

20120308 14:49:27 nbsp I’ve attended about twenty classes and my opinion of this space and the instructor is very high and continues to rise.  The room is light and cheery, with a good gripable floor.  There are lots of Pilates classes offered each week in varying levels of effort (intro, harder, serious, challenging) as well as a great slow stretching class.  Chris, the instructor, puts a lot of effort into each session and he seems intent on making it right for all class members.  A very laidback and welcoming atmosphere.   Users/FayeAshley

20120613 21:10:48 nbsp Fellow students! I have lost inches off of my waist in the past 2 months of going 3 times a week! I have always been pretty fit and I didnt expect to see results from Pilates but my stomach is showing definition and my butt has never been so firm! I am a huge fan of this studio and the instructor (so is my boyfriend ;)). The schedule is flexible and the rates are great especially as a busy student on a budget. The classes are divided into four levels of difficulty and it has been so rewarding working my way up to level four. The physical strength Ive developed has boosted my confidence and the positive atmosphere and stretching has done wonders for my stress levels. Why didnt I find this studio earlier!?!
