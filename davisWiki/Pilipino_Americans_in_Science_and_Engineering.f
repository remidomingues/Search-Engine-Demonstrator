PASE (Pilipino Americans in Science and Engineering) is one of the seven FilAm at UC Davis Filipino student organizations on the UC Davis campus. It provides support for minority College of Engineering engineering and Physics physical science students.

PASE holds many events throughout the school year including Professional Workshops, Design Workshops, Socials, and Video Game Tournaments. Every two years, PASE alternates its largest event: In the oddnumbered years, PASE holds an Engineering Conference, which is an outreach to high school students to motivate them in pursuing higher learning, especially engineering. In the evennumbered years, PASE holds a business Etiquette Dinner professionalism workshop, which teaches students proper etiquette during a dinnerinterview setting.

In 1980 the Associate Dean of the College of Engineering at UC Davis founded the Pilipino American Society of Engineers (PASE) in response to the increasing need for engineering support for minorities. Created within the College of Engineering, PASE, a nonprofit organization, was established to unite the small but evident Filipino American engineering population at the UC Davis campus. In 1997, PASE officially changed its name to Pilipino Americans in Science and Engineering to expand to the needs of Filipino American Students in physical sciences.

PASEs Mission Statement: PASE strives to provide social, academic, and professional support to physical science and engineering students of the UC Davis community.

PASE has recently opened up a Smartsite in order to provide easy access to its academic file bank to its members.  Contact either Brandon Sou (bsou@ucdavis.edu) or Dina Estipona (drestipona@ucdavis.edu) in order to be added to the SmartSite.



General Meetings
General meetings occur on Wednesday nights, at least once a month.  General meetings always include free food cooked by our food chair.  Usually professional or design workshops occur during general meetings.

Interview Workshops
Be able to go through mock interviews in order to prepare for job hunting!

Student/Alumni Panels
Be able to ask current students and PASE alumni about their time at UC Davis and postgrad life.  Get peer advice on what classes to take, how to get internships, and different types of career paths.


Design Workshops
Workshops where members create different things out of everyday household materials.  No engineering knowledge or experience is necessary to enjoy these workshops!  Usually the members are split into teams to create their masterpiece.  Your creations get judged and the winners get a prize!  The rules change every year, so design workshops are never the same!

Catapult Workshop
Build a catapult from materials ranging from KNEX to paper plates.  Criteria can vary from distance, accuracy, or style of the catapult.

Roller Coaster Workshop
Build a miniroller coaster inside a classroom made out of insulation tubing in order to transport a marble across the room!  Requirements can include loops, turns, height, and distance.

Egg Drop Workshop
Build a cushion to keep your egg from breaking after being dropped from a balcony!  Not only will you use the limited supplies to create a soft landing, but the platform also has to be big enough so that the egg wont miss and hit concrete!

Photoshop Workshop
Ever wondered how those awesome flyers and posters are put together?  Learn how to use Photoshop by one of our very own!
