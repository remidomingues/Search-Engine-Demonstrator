Founded in 1987, Pilipino Culture Night (PCN) is a production hosted by Mga Kapatid that showcases singing, acting, and traditional Pilipino dances. It is a yearlong process that builds community between the seven Pilipino American organizations, as well as those who are excited to learn about and share our culture. Dedication, an enthusiastic spirit, and openness to new experiences are the characteristics needed to be a part of this landmark event.

PCN welcomes and encourages people of all backgrounds to come and learn about the Pilipino culture.
