  http://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?id5237 Spiderman (Stern) (Right ramp and right loop dont register; Ball often gets stick in left side ramp; Auto plunger doesnt work (making multiballs effectively extra balls, since you can fire them off when you want)
  http://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?id4674 The Simpsons Pinball Party (Stern) (Sometimes the game wont register garage and treehouse ramp shots, other times, when these are working, some garage shots become left loop shots and rather than go to the living room, end up at the bumpers; Auto plunger doesnt work (making multiballs effectively extra balls, since you can fire them off when you want)
