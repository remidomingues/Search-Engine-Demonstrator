The Pincushion is a retail quilting and fabric store that carries a large selection of cotton fabrics, as well as complete quilt kits, quilt patterns, batting, notions, and a small selection of recent quilt books.  They are located on 2nd Street right next to the dog park (having moved from Spafford Street).
