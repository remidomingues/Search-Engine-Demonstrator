Pink Dozen is a donuts donut (or doughnut, if you want to get fancy) shop that replaced Variety Donuts.  Donuts are fresh made daily; they also sell coffee as well as Cookies, Pastries, and Baked Goods baked goods such as croissants, scones, and muffins.  They continue the Variety Donut tradition of creating jelly donuts by slicing them in half and spreading the jelly in between the halves.

Perhaps the name of the business refers to the ubiquitous pink boxes in which dozens of donuts seem to find themselves.

20110604 09:45:47 nbsp One change from Variety is they sometimes have some sort of spectacular creation; I went the other day and saw they had some kind of Oreo dream cupcake. Alas, I had to eat while driving so I passed it up. Does anyone know the story of whether this is in fact a new owner, or is the new girl just the daughter taking over management?
