Pinkberry is a Californiabased chain of fullserve frozen yogurt dessert outlets. Pinkberry is a franchise. A local owner owns the store. The owner pays Pinkberry to use the Pinkberry name and pays a percentage of the profits. The chain was founded by Hyekyung “Shelly” Hwang and Young Lee and they opened their first store around 2005 in West Hollywood, California. The store developed a fanatical following, much to the annoyance of neighbors. (The parking tickets were said to be a huge windfall for the city of Santa Monica.) As of mid 2010 there are five stores in the greater Sacramento region and over 70 stores worldwide. It can be argued the store helped launch the current Asianinspired semitart frozen yogurt craze that is popular in certain urban areas around the nation.

They use only nonrBST nonfat milk and nonfat yogurt to make their product; they do not use a powdered mix. Their yogurt has live and active cultures. Neither do they add water nor corn syrup. Their fruit is all fresh, not canned, and kept less than 24 hours. They have over 30 toppings needs verification, of which 90% have no trans fats.  The ingredient list for the Original Flavor is: nonfat milk, sugar, cultured pasteurized nonfat milk with live and active cultures, contains less than 2%: cultured nonfat milk powder, fructose, dextrose, natural and artificial flavors, citric acid, guar gum, maltodextrin, monoand diglycerides, lactoglycerides, propylene glycol esters, rice starch.  Information for the rest of the flavors is here: http://www.pinkberry.com/nutrition/nutritionfrozenyogurt.html

They have six flavors: Original Tart, Chocolate, Mango, Green Tea, Pomegranate, and a monthly featured flavor (Passion Fruit, Watermelon, Lychee, Blood Orange, Pumpkin, Coconut), but not the mysterious pinkberry.

They also have smoothies (a Berry flavor & a Green Tea flavor), a Fruit Parfait, and cones.

Taking over the former location of Papyrus, the franchise adds to the already saturated market of frozen yogurt shops in Davis. Along with Thai restaurants and sushi sushi buffets, add frozen yogurt to the list of businesses of which Plethora vs. Dearth in Davis Davis has a plethora. According to the Davis Enterprise, Swirl was forced to change its name in 2008 to Cultivé Frozen Yogurt Cultivé due to Pinkberrys claim that the Swirl name was too similar to their trademarked phrase, swirly goodness. Pinkberry also claimed that the leaf used in Swirls logo was too similar to the leaves used in Pinkberrys logo. It may also have brought the tiny town of Davis to their attention.

On 20100729, the evening before their store officially opened, they gave away free small (5 oz.) frozen yogurt cups with toppings to those who stood in line for three full hours. Mayor Don Saylor also attended, though after introducing himself he was welcomed into the VIP tent and did not wait in line.


20100205 13:56:47 nbsp Opening a FroYo shop within about 30 feet of Ben and Jerrys seems like a bad decision to me. Users/rfrazier


20100205 20:42:44 nbsp OMG Yes!  Users/GregWebb

20100206 10:18:42 nbsp Another FroYo place? Are you serious? Yogurt Shack is just up the street, Ben and Jerrys right next door, Cultive not much farther downtown, then YoloBerry, Sugar Plum, TuttiFrutty  overkill. Users/ChristyMarsden
  Pinkberry isnt just any other froyo place; its pretty much the froyo place in SoCal, the template so to speak. they mustve had their eyes on Davis for a while, which may explain why the company forced Cultive to change their name from Swirl (a term they claim is theirs alone). itll be interesting to see how their fullserve model flies in town. cultive saw a need to make the switch to selfserve for a reason. i guess well see how much branding and name recognition (as well as location) prevails over perceived value.
    20100802 00:37:20 nbsp Sure enough, Pinkberry is anything but the froyo place in Davis.


20100206 11:33:28 nbsp Im sticking with the local joints, personally. Users/CovertProfessor

20100318 22:07:59 nbsp Ill give them a try at least once, but Ill be slightly biased because they made Swirl change their name.  Its going to be Swirl for me, always >:( Users/AlexanderHo

20100318 22:37:39 nbsp Well, its definitely good that they are coming here.  This has been a town as completely devoid of yogurt shops as it is devoid of places to get sushi, thai, pizza, burgers, or bicycles.  And according to the Sacramento Bee article, they mainly differentiate themselves by being...more expensive?!  Seems like an unusual strategy to me... Users/IDoNotExist

20100318 23:28:23 nbsp this is right down the street from Yogurt Shack & Cultive. Gosh, nothing wrong with a variety, but dang, too much variety in this case... rather than allowing a business to do well because of its uniqueness, this is just starting up a trend that will cause all of the other yogurt shops to have mediocre business, neither of them can really prosper like this... Users/ThUn

20100324 18:57:31 nbsp It looks like its not just Davis, theyre expanding the market to the entire Sacramento area. Id be surprised if dont try and get into Davis, with its large college student population. Unfortunately large chains like that cares nothing of the already saturated market of frozen yogurt shop anywhere  they have the capital to come, and go as they please. Users/LeeY

20100502 02:58:02 nbsp its going to be the best froyo place in town. Users/film

20100518 10:24:24 nbsp I agree with CovertProfessor, I will be giving my business to the local shops. Users/DagonJones
 I would concur wholeheartedly with the previous statement  Daubert
I dont really understand why this city needs yet another frozen yogurt place. Ive been to pinkberry and while they are better than some of the places we have, Cultive has been my personal local favorite.  AlvinTsao



20100618 14:14:35 nbsp This is my handsdown favorite fro yo place in the world. My hometown is an hour north of Santa Barbara, Ca and while visiting home I make a point to drive to SB just for this delicious treat. I cant wait for it to open, huzzah! Users/Jeserah

20100730 09:39:00 nbsp Went last night, saw the line, turned around, went to SugarPlum instead. Users/BrianPakpour

20100730 10:35:01 nbsp How does this place compare to the other froyo places in town?  Ive never been to one, so what gives it the fanatical following? Users/TomGarberson
 Maybe there are so many other branches, that alot of them are in places where there are no other choices for frozen yogurt. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20100730 17:19:25 nbsp the economic sense of college students amazes me.  I would pay $3 to not wait in line for three hours.  I would probably pay twenty dollars for such a privilege.  This privilege was available free to everyone who waited in line. Users/tombrokaw

20100730 19:00:03 nbsp Stood in line for 3 hours along with a couple of friends on opening day. The lighting, colors, and decor are really relaxing. The employees were super nice and energetic even though they had to take froyo orders like crazy. They were also very generous with the yogurt portions and toppings. This was our first taste of Pinkberry and I must say that we were pleasantly surprised. The passionfruit/mango mix was just awesome but the original tart was not very tart, and the pomegranate flavor didnt really taste like pomegranate. In my opinion, Cultive has the best tart if youre into that, SugarPlums tart fruit flavors are comparable to Pinkberrys, and Yoloberry still has the best selection of toppings. But I give them points for being the first froyo place to be able to have yogurt that I finished without having to see a pool of liquid at the bottom. All in all, its just another froyo place to go to if youre near Borders and dont want to walk a block away to get to another froyo place. But I would definitely go back just because their yogurts texture is just so perfect, it is nicely creamy and soft and yet it does not melt in your bowl while you pay for it. Users/DavisFoodie

20100730 23:44:12 nbsp What a strange sort of business. Davis needs more used bookstores and fewer overpriced frozen yogurt stores. Users/BarnabasTruman
 Yes! Yes! Yes! I miss Bogeys. Sweet Briar is still awesome though. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20100802 00:42:48 nbsp Ill admit that I have an aversion to southern California for some reason. That said, I nearly gagged at how hard Pinkberry was trying to be just that. The yogurt was tasty, just like all the other places in downtown Davis and beyond, but was more expensive. It seemed unnecessary that they needed six staff and a manager when Yolo Berry does with a single employee at the register. I did like what seemed to be a mini Captain Crunch, though! Users/MichaelAWoods
   Actually the proper spelling is Capn Crunch.  Yoloberry has miss spelled this fine cereal as well, I informed them of their error but apparently I am the only one who cares about the Capn. Users/DagonJones

20100802 02:51:34 nbsp Ill give this place a try, but I hope its worth the high price and not overhyped by these fanatical fans. Itll be hard to beat Yolo berry yogurt Yoloberry. Users/TheShah

20100802 20:35:00 nbsp Though I really wanted to hate Pinkberry, I gave it a shot the other night, and it was quite delicious. I never even liked tart yogurt, and their original tart with mango was really good. Their chocolate with caramely, chocolately rice krispy sauce was delicious as well. Cons: the staff was borderline obnoxious. Too many girls behind the counter. I felt like I was being pecked by chickens the way each was asking or telling me something different. It was also pretty expensive. My husband and I both got smalls with one topping and it came to $8 something. Ill save it for a onceinawhile treat. Users/AmLin

20100816 19:23:56 nbsp I dont like it.  Tried two samples and threw away my discount cards.  Yoloberry rules. Users/JimStewart

20100820 01:15:19 nbsp The portion of froyo they give you is not the usual amount that I get at the pinkberry in Sacramento. I was unhappy with the service also, I felt very rushed and the workers were slow at getting the orders. Also, they should really get a scale the small yogurts because it is definitely not what their average estimate is in the cup for $4+. Also, the workers looked miserable working here; it was almost if they forced themselves to be happy serving you. Not genuine whatsoever.  Users/MissAmyQ
  putting up with everything any food service industry worker has to, a forced smile for minimum wage is a blessing. Me, I tell people right away, dont bother with a fake smile, be real with me. 90% of the time people appreciate it and I usually get better service than the average Joe. You go out and smile for minimum wage in Davis with the high cost of living, thats the last thing anyone should complain about with any food joint.  Users/WesP

20100826 09:12:45 nbsp In all honesty, PinkBerrys yogurt is quite good compared to your runofthemill frozen yogurt joint. Despite its taste it is quite pricey, perhaps a bit too pricey for most. Personally the yogurt doesnt justify the steep price because honestly the difference in taste isnt dramatic.

Anyways, my heart will always be with Yoloberry. Users/blastoff

20100827 06:06:51 nbsp Went here the other day and I thought it was delicious. I had been wanting to try Pinkberry for a while, Im glad it came to Davis. And their toppings are super good too. My favorite is the chocolate/original swirl with chocolate crips, mochi & cheesecake. Friendly empolyees and a really cool look to the store! Probably the best fro yo place Ive been to in all of Davis! Users/NorCalFoodLover

20100907 14:15:38 nbsp The fullserve model seems to be a bad idea.  I had to wait for 5 minutes without even being acknowledged while a party of 5+ people sampled every flavor individually and were being served by all of the employees on staff despite my vocalization that I was not with them.  At the very least one should break away to handle other customers as they come in when dealing with a large party.  I cant complain too much because when someone (an employee just starting her shift who saw me waving for attention) finally got to me and I told her what I observed she gave me my froyo free.  The yogurt itself is pretty much on par with cultive I think.  Still there are so many places in town...I wonder if this place will get all the socal loyal students. Users/OliviaY

20100914 21:01:49 nbsp It;s not that good the inside is very pretty, yet its not self served so you dont get that feeling you get at places sch as yolo berry Users/AlexKiani

20100917 00:47:57 nbsp i think this is all hype.. i prefer yolo berry and cultive personally Users/sallythatgirl

20101005 21:56:08 nbsp I went in today and I saw that they now offer discounts to Davis Students, which is great! Theyre offering a 20% discount to UCD students that bring in their ID, and theyre offering a happy hour discount: 50% off on a Medium yogurt with toppings for Davis Students everyday from 79pm. Thats great that theyre supporting the Aggies like a lot of other places in town! :) Users/NorCalFoodLover

20101007 22:37:22 nbsp I was skeptical trying Davis 6th yogurt shop.. But the yogurt is quite unique and good.  I really do not like the full serve idea, and how they pile the yogurt high so you barely get any toppings. Also, it is quite expensive even with the student discounts. Ill definitely keep my money with the local shops.. Where I really get to pick what I want. PLUS Pinkberry doesnt have vanilla!  Users/redbike

20101012 13:30:15 nbsp The staff were attentive, understanding and helpful. Went in with a large group and many wished to have samples of a few things prior to ordering. In the end, only two of the group actually ordered anything and the rest went elsewhere.

The yogurt didnt taste much better than standard store bought Yoplait and I personally found that the inability to place your own toppings on the purchase was a bit annoying. I personally like very little of the toppings and add just a small amount for flavor but they apparently place a portion size similar on all orders regardless and I found the toppings too sweet for my tastes.

As for cost, I find that the sizes dont really mean much to me. Why have a set cost per cup at all? I think people should be charged for what they use regardless of what cup it comes in. Personally I just want a little yogurt, not even a full cup so it makes no sense to me.

 Users/WesP

20101030 16:12:59 nbsp Im from LA (where there is Pinkberry on practically every corner) and I was very excited to see one opening here.  Then I went in and I guess its not as good as I remember.  There original is not nearly as tart as I remember it being.  Sorry, Cultive has got you beat. Users/elgreen

20101130 01:10:14 nbsp There is now Weekly Entertainment at Pinkberry, please contact the store for details if you would like to be involved:
Monday Night: Family Game Night 68pm, Tuesday Trivia Night 79pm, Wednesday Night: Open Mic Night 79pm Users/SaherR

20110111 10:52:16 nbsp They skimp on toppings, and its expensive! $14 for 3 small yogurts. I wont go back. Users/JasperD

20110301 21:52:18 nbsp never going back  because of victoria. Users/marcuscamby

20110521 13:47:57 nbsp I had a good experience here. The staff were pleasant and my coconut yogurt with mochi was delicious. The mochi toppings were really fresh, unlike some of the other places Ive been to in Davis, where they were kinda hard and dry. Ive never been to a Pinkberry before so I cant really compare to other locations. The smallest size is usually enough for me, and I also had a BOGO free coupon. Under other conditions, I guess it might be a bit pricey.  Users/blee

20110711 14:51:26 nbsp At first I was not going to give my business to some SoCal company who was bossing around a small town yogurt shop (referring to the cultive swirl incident).  One day I made the mistake of trying the yogurt here.  I find it to be very very tasty, I like it better than other yogurts, the plain and mango are very good.  I feel guilty but it is true.  If you do the math there is no question it is more expensive than other places Users/DagonJones

20110902 12:54:12 nbsp Ive never felt so ripped off. I just paid $4.50 for half a cup of yogurt.  Im never going there again. Users/kevinhawkins

20130603 14:16:53 nbsp I finally had reason to go here recently, but never again, for the same reasons that others have given.  The yogurt and toppings taste fine, but they are not amazing, and they are certainly no better than you can get at the independent yogurt shops in Davis.  Plus Pinkberry is more expensive ($5 for a small yogurt with toppings!) and it is annoying to have to explain what you want, itembyitem, to the person behind the counter (who was overly perky at my visit) rather than just taking what you want and how much of it you want.
