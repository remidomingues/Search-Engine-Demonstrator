they say Pioneer is Home of the Prairie Dogs
I remembered this one time when my friends and i found a prairie Dog and some kid went to tell a staff member about it (in a Hey look a Prairie Dog Manner).
The staff came back with a bucket of water and poured a bucket of water down the Dogs Hole.
the staff members feared rabies. It was a good decision in terms of safety for us kids but a bad decision in terms of the Dogs health. D: Users/DarkArchon
