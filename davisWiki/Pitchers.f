Pitchers of beer are:
  a way of increasing your Alcohol to money ratio
  facilitating the friendly sharing of social lubricant amongst friends
     OR
  a way of getting one or more people drunk faster and cheaper.

Presumably due to this last item, several Davis bars have stopped offering pitchers.  This page will help us find places where our friends can still pick up glasses and share a round.

Some Pitchers are part of Happy Hour Specials

  The Graduate
  Froggys
  Delta of Venus
  Plainfield Station has the best price on pitchers, easily
  Silo Pub and Cafe
  Burgers and Brew
  G St. Wunderbar
  Caffe Italia did and may still confirm?
  Uncle Vitos
  Lamppost Pizza
  de Veres Irish Pub
  Red 88 Noodle Bar
  Round Table Pizza
  Dot Island Grill

Does anyone know of more places that still have pitchers?  Please fill in the rest

Sudwerk no longer carries pitchers, although they sometimes look the other way if you order a liter (~half a pitcher?) and share it among your legalage friends like it was one.

A Pitcher is also the unit of reward for the annual Butterflies for Beer contest.

Sharing pitchers with underage buddies is a very Police bad way of trying to get alcohol for / as a minor.  It makes it too easy to get caught, including the buyer (criminal penalties) as well as getting the bartender and business in trouble.  It also discourages places from serving pitchers to the rest of us.
