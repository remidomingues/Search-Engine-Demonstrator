20130909 09:08:59 nbsp I hesitate to write this review because I dont want her to get too busy and not have time for my little girl, but Patti and her husband are absolutely phenomenal! I spent a lot of time on DavisWiki checking out all the petsitters, and I struck gold with Patti. Shes watched my dog twice now and the security I feel when I have to leave her is so worth it. You can trust her with your home and your pet her love for animals is obvious. Users/TawnyLaBarbera
