Davis, being a UC Davis college town, has many establishments that offer all sorts of pizzas.  Pizza is one of the few things available for Delivery delivery in Davis. If youre really hard core, and want some of the best pizza ever known to mankind, you can drive to the Bay Area and pick yourself up some Zacharys Pizza. However, you can get Chicago Style Pizza at several other places nearby and save some gas.

Pizza is an iconically delivered item, and tipping the person delivering the pizza is common.  The http://tipthepizzaguy.com/ Tip the Pizza Guy Website has guides on how to tip, and also how to place an order to make sure you get what you want, how to make sure the delivery person can find the house and more.

Most of the pizza establishment pages have an accompanying photo of a typical large pepperoni pizza.

Using data on size and cost, Galen Plotkin (an 8th grade student at the Davis Waldorf School) created a pizza value index for Davis pizzerias. The cheapest pizza in Davis in 2013 was, unexpectedly, Village Pizza tied with Uncle Vitos.

Table of Price and Size

This table shows the typical (not on sale) price for a basic cheese pizza (no extra toppings) and the pizza diameter in inches.


 Deals 
The table is greatly confounded, of course, by the uneven price of toppings and the massive amounts of special deals available.  Listed here are known deals that dont require a coupon, although they may require you to be knowledgeable of the deal before going into the store, as pizza places know that if you walked in sans coupon and knowledge of a discount youre probably willing to pay more.  If you dont mind being sleazy to save a buck, sometimes you can get a reduced price by simply flirting with the clerk and asking what deals they have that arent listed on the menu.

  If you get takeout from Pizza Guys you get a free 2 liter soda. They also have a coupon special for under $12 that includes a large pizza w/ one topping (FSI109), cheesy garlic bread (FSI56.7), and a free drink. Counting the garlic bread, they have the best FSI to price ratio in Davis.

 Functional Square Inch 

As the diameter of a pizza increases, the area of the pizza increases as well, but a doubling of diameter, quadruples area. Thus, a 16 inch pizza has four times the area of an 8 inch pizza. The graph below shows the relationship.


As you can see on the graph, an inch more of diameter produces significantly more area at larger diameters than at smaller diameters. Based on this information, the price per square inch would seem like an appropriate metric of pizza value. Unfortunately, however, not all pizzas are made the same. A large crust margin, in particular, tends to confound the real size of a pizza. A more accurate measure of pizza value is introduced here: the Functional Square Inch (FSI). The FSI includes only the area containing toppings, and can therefore reveal how much certain places rip people off by having a ridiculous amount of crust.

BR FSI  3.14159  (radius  crust length)(radius  crust length)

The table below shows the FSI for local pizzas.

Please consult Pizza: FSI Calculations for how to interpret and update this chart.


 Make Your Own 
Making pizza can be a cinch or it can be a fun, allday cooking project depending how much time you want to put on it.

 Dough 
You can use a pizza stone to cook pizza, but it isnt required.  For a cheaper alternative to a pizza stone, get a large, unglazed flooring tile (ceramic is better than composite, since composite will expand and contract differently and break quicker).  Theyre available at Lowes in West Sacramento for around $5.  You can also just precook the dough right on the oven rackabout 810 minutes at 375400 degrees will give you a nice crust, shorter if you roll it out really thin.  Pull it out, add the sauce, cheese, and toppings, and toss it back in until theyre done.

  Premade, precooked doughs are available at most supermarkets
  Many pizzerias sell dough balls in various sizes (e.g. Lamppost large dough ball is $3, and easily rolls out into a 1618 pie)
  You can make your ownjust do a web search for pizza dough recipes

 Sauce 
Most pizzerias offer red and white sauces; many offer a wide variety of others.
  For a classic red sauce, use a 6oz can of tomato paste, 3/4 cup water, a drizzle of honey, a little parmesan cheese, some minced garlic (optional), and a few seasonings of your choice (e.g. a dash each of oregano, basil, marjoram, and cayenne pepper).
  You can even use spaghetti sauce from a jar, if you want something quick and easy.
  Like white sauces at pizza joints?  Try a jar of garlic alfredo sauce.
  Pesto (homemade or store bought) makes a great pizza sauce.
  Blue cheese salad dressing is also great.
  Your favorite BBQ sauce will be delicious on pizza.

 Cheese 
  Shredded mozzarella is quick, easy, and fairly traditional.  Around 8 oz. is good for one largeish pizza.  You can get it in 8 or 16oz. bags at any grocery store.
  Try mixing it up.  Use a few different cheeses.  Sprinkle some parmesan on.  If youre using bold toppings, try a smoked cheese (gouda or mozzarella, for example).

 Toppings 
There arent that many things that arent good on pizza.  You can get really creative and get some fantastic results.  Be sure to precook any uncooked meats.
  Pepperoni, sliced ham and canned pineapple, and so on are quick and easy.  Chicken, shrimp, bacon, salami, black olives, bell pepper, mushroom, onion, zucchini, bacon, basil, spinach, tomato, artichoke hearts (try marinated!) ... the list goes on and on.
  Chopped fresh veggies of all sorts make for an amazing pizza.  Try sprinkling some Italian seasoning over the top (you can get a real kick of flavor using one of those Italian dressing spice blendswithout the oil and vinegar, of course).
  Like hot wings?  Try cooking up a couple of chicken breasts and tossing them with your favorite hot sauce (Franks Red Hot is a pretty common Buffalo sauce).  Great with a blue cheese dressing as the sauce.
  Shrimp, bacon, and tomatoes make a pretty amazing combination, especially with pesto or a garlic alfredo sauce.
  Try experimenting with some of the classics.  Like Hawaiian?  Chop up some fresh pineapple and an onion and marinate it for a few hours in good maple syrup and a bit of cayenne pepper.  Yum.

20100125 16:53:24 nbsp To the best of my knowledge, Uncle Vitos doesnt deliver. However, their pizza pwns all others. Yeah, its pricey though. Definitely not something I would go for without others chipping in.

Woodstocks sucks, Steves is okay, the Village Bakery is decent. Konditorei only serves breakfast pizza which is more like foccaiccia + stuff.  Users/dizzyditz

20050221 22:15:09 nbsp price per square inch! price per square inch! Users/ArlenAbraham

20050221 23:05:28 nbsp Price varies considerably if you have one of the MANY coupons though.  What Id like is a picture of what a standard pepperoni pizza looks like, since some have more and some have less.  Or, at least, a count of the amount of pepperoni in a pizza.  Either way, price per square inch is a bit misleading, since we should also count crust radius (a 12 pizza with a 1 crust has significantly more crust per square inch than a 16 pizza with a 1 crust) Users/ScottRitchie

20050514 18:02:07 nbsp Oh man, the FSI table is the awesomest idea! Brilliant! Users/JeyKottalam

20050607 09:31:53 nbsp Think of it this way  you can get a really great apartment with awesome furniture, a stateoftheart sound system, a new King size bed, and perfect climate control system, and youll spend some $$ to get it.  Or you can get a way bigger apartment with a leaky roof, crappy furniture, a squeaky ghetto blaster, and a bed you found in the alley, and it wont cost near as much.  Bigger  yes!  Better???  Its not just the size of the pizza, its whats on it and how it tastes.  With this FSI calculation, the cheapest, crappiest pizza in Davis will win, but that doesnt make it a good value. Users/LauraAmbrose

20050607 09:50:00 nbsp Well, while I think the FSI too confusing too be really useful (it would probably be better just to rank who has the most crust), its not really measuring who has the biggest pizza, its really measuring the REAL dimensions of pizza with toppings on it.  I think its ultimately misleading because pizza places are not consistent in this regard, so it would be better just to list the habitual offenders and estimate how much unused crust there is.  And I also think that there is no real spectacular pizza in Davis, so the biggest, best value is usually not too different than the worst value.  Id like to say you get what you pay for, but some of the most mediocre pizza can be pretty expensive. Users/JaimeRaba

20050607 10:36:40 nbsp option 2: separate toppings from crust. weigh each. give total weight and % crust. cmon, whos got a scale Users/ArlenAbraham

20050727 13:38:23 nbsp Laura, the FSI in no way reflects on the quality of the pizza. Rather, its a rough way to put pizza on a consistent economic scale. Once pizza size has been normalized with the FSI, you, as an informed consumer, can compare equal sized pizzas and determine whether the taste quality difference is worth the extra price. For example, in terms of FSI, the medium at Mountain Mikes Pizza, the medium at Symposium, and the large at Woodstocks Pizza are equivalent. Theyre respective prices are $11.65, $9.95, and $14.16. Woodstocks is the most expensive, and IMHO is my least favorite of the three. Its clearly out. Symposium is far better than MMs, and is $1.70 cheaper! Its really comforting to know that Symposium, arguably the best pizza in town, is both best quality and economical for an FSI of 95 and no toppings. A lot of people avoid it, however, because they dont take FSI into account, and erroneously believe its too pricey. More data needs to be collected to determine which place place in Davis has the best FSI:price ratio. Users/CraigBrozinsky

20050820 14:32:20 nbsp Honestly, the price+size chart could be integrated.  Like this:  $14.99 (16) Users/JaimeRaba

20050820 18:30:54 nbsp Hmm, we should probably merge the FSI table in too.  The table needs serious deuglification too, but I lack the skills. Users/ScottRitchie

20050921 21:17:39 nbsp RishiTrivedi writes Davis Pizza Rankings: 1. (twoway tie) Steves, Village Bakery  I dont get it... Steves combination pizza didnt even come close to woodstocks causeway class or village bakerys anything Users/VivianPham

20051231 15:53:57 nbsp if you live in or near north davis, the best deal hands down is papa murphys.  yeah you have to cook it in your own oven, but big deal.  you dont have to tip a delivery boy and its cheap!  i will edit in the prices after the next time im there, but it is definitely some of the cheapest in town.  also, i almost constantly get coupons for their pizza in the mail making it even cheaper.  as for quality, its obviously not the most amazing pizza youve ever had, but i think it is just fine and much better than steves place or mountain mikes garbage. Users/IanRamsay

20060123 19:48:53 nbsp Question: If there is already a delivery charge, do you tip? Users/JoAnnaRich
           Yes!  Generally the delivery charge does not go to the employee but rather gas, upkeep of the car, and extra labor.

20060308 20:04:49 nbsp But pizzas also vary in thickness as well. I propose a price per volume, or given the fact that there are thin and thick crusts, a price per mass of the functional area of the pizza? Now the question is, dry weight or wet weight? Can I also get a mass spectrometer, calorimeter, and spectrophotometer to complete the analysis..? Oh here we go... Lets use an electronic tongue and publish the ratios of various volatiles and other compounds and publish the definitive flavor comparison? Lets also factor in the fuel economy of the delivery persons so we can also have the most environmentally sound pizza. Ok... I got a little hyperbolic here. I think my point about thickness/mass might be valid, though. Users/KarlMogel


20060910 10:21:00 nbsp there is no question.  when it comes to taste village bakery is the clear cut winner.  Symposium comes in a distant second. Users/MattHh

20070201 00:01:25 nbsp Woodstocks cant compare to many of the other (independent and chain) pizza places in Davis. I dont know why people like it so much. Users/TusharRawat

20080203 13:31:29 nbsp I dont get it. Why is it so expensive when I go to Steves? Ooohh, the toppings! Users/DavidFeliz

20080203 15:50:20 nbsp Ive had Lamppost, Woodstocks, Coho (which I think is just frozen pizza isnt it?), Village Bakery, Papa Murphys, Dining Commons (does that even count?), and The Graduate and of those four, Village Bakery wins.  My dad and brother have only had Village Bakery, but they think its the best. Users/JasonDunne

20080921 03:25:32 nbsp pizza is way overrated. its only good when you get drunk.. oh wait.. i get it now. Users/2point0student

20090612 20:50:29 nbsp Why is the delivery fee for Vitos $21.95? Users/TusharRawat
  Their pizzas are huuuuuuge and require special trucks to move them?  Or maybe thats Vitos special delivery fee, where they whack the guy it is sent to.  Or maybe somebody typoed.

20100125 16:53:24 nbsp To the best of my knowledge, Uncle Vitos doesnt deliver. However, their pizza pwns all others. Yeah, its pricey though. Definitely not something I would go for without others chipping in.

20100501 17:37:52 nbsp It has been my experience that people will usually ADORE one of the pizza places, and hate all the others with the firey passion of a thousand burning suns. The most signifigant polarization tends to be between Steves Place and Woodstocks. You will almost never find someone who likes both. Users/Flynn
  Its the same with most businesses in my opinion. For example, Droms Comics and Cards and Bizarro World, Ali Baba and Sams Mediterranean, Raja Indian Cuisine and Kathmandu Kitchen, and Davis Sushi Buffet and Fuji Chef. Users/hankim
   Me, Im not crazy about Steves or Woodstocks (I like Village Bakery/Grill, Lamppost, or Symposium), dont care about the gaming places, but love Ali Baba, Sams, Raja, and Kathmandu.  Not crazy about Davis Sushi Buffet or Fuji (I like Zen Toro and miss Osaka Sushi).. YMMV.   Users/CovertProfessor

20110815 22:54:50 nbsp My favorite pizza in Davis is hands down village pizza, but only the bakery. Somehow their new restaurants oven seems to be different and not quite as nice. For real Italian pizza, I go to Hot Italian in Sacramento (by real Italian I mean thin crust, not loaded with 1 deep cheese layer sliding off the 1 of tomato sauce). I would not voluntarily eat any other pizza in Davis unless its free journal club pizza. Users/DrX
