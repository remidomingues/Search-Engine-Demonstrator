Pizza Guys is a large chain and one of the lowerpriced Pizza places in Davis. Discounts and freebies Coupons come in the junk mail mail all the time. You can get a free 2liter bottle of Pepsi or 8 oz. ice cream if you pickup any pizza order. They also Delivery deliver for $2.95 (delivery fee was increased from $2 on 20110219).

The deals involving the garlic bread are definitely worth it. The area of the garlic bread is 1/2 that of the large pie, and with an Pizza: FSI Calculations FSI of 56.7, it has 58% as much cheese as a large pie.

If you have a Super Saver Card, you can get  an XLarge 3topping pizza for $12.99 and a second XLarge 3topping pizza of equal or lesser value for $9.99.  They also offer an AAA Discount.

Apparently it is the Davis pizza location of choice for San Francisco 49ers coach Jim Harbaugh, who was spotted here Saturday, July 16th.

They now have gluten free option for custom 12 pizza.

20090318 13:18:09 nbsp Good food, but stingy on the toppings. Users/strawberry

20090524 17:19:37 nbsp Best Pizza in Davis!! Users/aaron.smith

20090527 22:21:25 nbsp So, I used to think that Steves had the best cheezy garlic breadsticks, but then I tried Pizza Guys. THEY ARE FREAKING AMAZING. I love the cheese and garlic sauce, and they always serve it with ranch (but will give you marinara if you ask). I did have a problem with delivery once, because they couldnt find my apartment, then called me and said they were here, only to call back and say they werent. I ended up having to walk away from my actual apartment to the front of the complex, only to find out they came to my door anyways after I asked them to stay at the sign. However, they did make it up to me by giving me extra breadsticks (although, I found it peculiar that they already premade them like they KNEW they were gonna screw up).

Also, they have great deals a lot of the time. But if you go for pickup, make sure you bring mace, cuz that neighborhood is shaaaady. Users/BrookeB

20090724 11:37:11 nbsp Update on my last posting (because I eat Pizza Guys way too much) they really are stingy on the toppings, and they seem to take a long time to make pizzas. Ive called and it sounded really dead in the store, and theyve told me its going to take 30 minutes or so, and then when we go pick up the pizza (and the store is dead) its not even ready yet. They did a big oops on one of our orders, but they gave us a whole new pizza on top of the messed up one for free (but that could just be because some of the employees are Russian and I was hanging with a Russian fellow).

All in all, its cheap and pretty tasty so Ill eat it, but Lamppost and even Papa Johns are better. Users/Kiran

20100325 16:34:02 nbsp This pizza is simply low quality. It is greasy but not in a good way. The crust on just a one topping is soggy and the sauce lacks flavor. The service is friendly but that is the only good thing coming from this pizza joint. Users/JoeRandom

20100519 10:03:25 nbsp What are you talking about.. this place is SO expensive! 15.99 for specialty medium _  wow Users/JKx788

20100627 00:05:30 nbsp This place is awesome if you use their coupons. Most of the time you can just mention the coupon and not actually have one in hand, you can also print the coupons from their website. The pizza is not the best in town, but it isnt bad. I just got an extra large pepperoni delivered for 15.49. They are open late enough and are usually pretty fast if its not the weekend. My order was 45 min on a sat night. Tip the drivers a couple bucks if you can, they deserve it. Users/reviewaskew

20100822 21:29:48 nbsp Fair pizza, commensurate with the price which is lower than the better pizza places in Davis. You definitely want to use a coupon and they are not hard to find. It seems like I get one mailed to me every week. There is one thing about Pizza Guys in Davis that really pisses me off ....... for pickup orders, as a matter of standard operating procedure, they are always 5  25 minutes later than they tell you. Just got back from there and it went better than usual. On the phone the guy said it would be 10  15 minutes, Im pretty sure this is his boiler plate statement. It was 23 minutes. I use the place because with a coupon it is inexpensive as fair pizzas in Davis go, and it is one block from my house. When I care to spend a little more and get the best pizza in town I get one from Steves Pizza. Some other long time Davis residents may disagree with me and say Woodstocks Pizza is the best. However, those places are rather expensive.   Users/djnurco
  I would actually say Village Bakery, but Im with you on convenience.  Users/WesP

HORRIBLE SERVICE  do not go here!  First, they are late on my pickup time, then they give me the wrong pizza, the wrong pasta. When I call the place to get my pizza replaced, they put me on hold for ten minutes, and the asshole manager Vova tells me to chill out when I complain about being forgotten on the phone, and then bitches when I ask him to redeliver the pizza. These guys are dicks.  Could even get acknowledged at the counter. GO ELSEWHERE. Users/DavisLurker

20101028 09:29:03 nbsp Having moved on from Davis, I will say that I really miss being able to order a pesto pizza.  I always have to make my own if I want a pesto pizza, which defeats the idea of pizza as convenience food for a crowd (and I dont particularly like most pizza anyway). Users/JabberWokky

20110220 08:58:01 nbsp The Chicken Bacon pizza with white sauce is still ove favorite after all these years and a good deal too! A large is about $10.80. Users/jsbmeb

20110223 00:48:06 nbsp Went to Pizza Guys late (after 9pm) today. Food was good but I felt extremely uncomfortable because a crowd of shadylooking loiterers started forming outside while I was eating inside. If you want pickup, go during the daytime. After nighttime, have it delivered. I had to call a cab. Users/rrenati

20110223 04:01:30 nbsp Bought some pizza for the first time in months from this place... Little Ceasars has better quality and that is saying something...  About the only edible thing on it was the crust.

meh.. what can one expect from a place whose drivers drive like bats out of hell and employees who throw soda bottles on the roof of the place they work at...  Yes, if you are the owner, take a look on your roof... not to mention the nighttime smoke sessions they have in the parking lot from time to time, and Im not talking about cigarettes. Users/WesP

20110316 22:42:15 nbsp Admittedly, Im not a big pizza connoisseur, but I immediately noticed the poor quality of the food that the Pizza Guys deliver.
I have never really understood when people complain about badtextures with pizza. I mean pizza is pizza, right? Its pretty hard to mess up.
But the pizza I got from this place had noticeably rubbery cheese, fairly tasteless crust , and weirdly undercooked pepperoni (if there is such a thing)it was as if it was put on the pizza AFTER it was  brought out of the oven.

In all, Im not going to spend my money there again.
My suggestion: If you want cheap, go cenarios cheese  YUM, flavorful, melty, and if you want the primo delivered pizza Id say get some the stuff from Steves place. Users/someday909

20110321 20:04:17 nbsp Did I already mention these guys are ALWAYS late. Well here I go again. I call in a order for pickup and they tell me it will be ready in 25 minutes. I arrive there 40 minutes later and the guy is like, 6 minutes, no 5 minutes. I walk out for a minute and walk back in to find him making my calzone and putting it in the oven. I ask is that my order, did you forget about it? He responds that he was busy taking and making orders. Dude, dont say 25 minutes if youre not going to start the thing until I arrive 40 minutes later. Users/djnurco

20110517 17:34:12 nbsp Put in a delivery order over an hour ago  it still hasnt arrived. The pizzas good, but I suppose ordering for takeout would be best. Users/MarkTwain

20110809 16:41:35 nbsp Pizza and drugs is a good combination. You can purchase drugs from the unattractive, red headed fellow at Pizza Guys while hes working. One thing thats not cool, Ive seen him sell weed to a pretty young looking kid.  Users/friendthegirl

20110824 20:03:33 nbsp pizza guys is not stingy on toppings fool
 Users/bambamred

20110824 20:08:18 nbsp theplace takes so long to get shit cuz ther are under staffed u get it stop bitchen bout it takin so long and tlk to the owners cuz the people ther for the most part work hard Users/bambamred

20110824 22:07:46 nbsp I called to order a medium pizza one day for myself and one other person.  The employee confirmed my order and then quickly said an extra large would be cheaper, and hung up.  He took my order from a medium to an extra large without consulting me at all.  Even if it was more cost effective that was bizarre and not what I wanted.  The pizza was just okay, nothing special.  I had an inordinate amount of leftovers and have not gone back. Users/LoriOrf

20111009 20:14:13 nbsp I used to like them, but they got two orders wrong IN A ROW. Something horrible happened to the customer service. So only go here if youre willing to A) wait forever or B) willing to have your order taken wrong.  Users/Inyx

20111119 22:55:41 nbsp Pizza Guys was kind enough to bring deeply discounted pizzas to the peaceful protest of Katehis press conference today. :) Users/zombiek

20111208 18:03:04 nbsp its cheap and a ton of food and its great for when the guys are coming over but I wouldnt get it if it was just me solo† Users/KellenRuel

20120424 17:28:09 nbsp Pizza is not great, but it has the BEST cheesy garlic bread. For the price there is not a better Pizza in town, way better than Dominoes.  Users/JoeRandom

20120508 23:50:07 nbsp Hi,
I would like to leave my feedback about Pizza Guys Co and specifically the branch Im the always customer at. Ive been to a couple of different locations throughout Sacramento but my favourite is the one on L str in Davis, CA. Even though its a little far for me I go only there because of their delucious pizza that generously cooked by the family members. Those people because they are the family make this place special. They are so friendly, polite, pleasant to deal with, they always do everything to satisfy even the most picky customer. Service is great, atmosphere is friendly, place is very clean itself. Recently they bought new tables and chairs, I wish such places had TVs so we could come and watch soccer in this cosy pizzeria. But the most important is their pizzas and actually the whole menu, its cooked professionally. Lots of puzzeria try to cut expenses by underfilling pizzas with topings, Pizza in Davis is always overfilling thats really very nice of them cause I as a customer realise that people working there are trying to do a good business instead of cutting expenses by cooking unperfect meal. Users/Mv17429
  Is it wrong to be suspicious of this comment? If I am wrong, and this is a legit comment left by someone with no personal connextion the the business, then my bad. But this seems fishy to me.  Users/jsbmeb

20120509 21:54:38 nbsp yes it is!! Users/Theangrydiner

20120510 16:32:51 nbsp That comment may be suspicious, but I live nearby and also frequent the L Street shop and agree with every word.  Users/AJThompson

20130530 23:01:00 nbsp The customer service is awful. I was told 20 min before closing that they were no longer accepting new orders. Guess she had something more important to do then her job. She did however let me know they would be open tomorrow at 11. Great... Will not be eating here again Users/PhillipLiems
  Maybe they had a lot of orders and she had something more important to do than work well past closing time of 10pm on a work/school night.  They do need to bake and deliver the pie after all those other last minute orders.  Users/RyanMeyerhoff

20130531 00:42:15 nbsp Great pizza.  My pickup orders have always been on time. Users/RyanMeyerhoff

20131112 20:43:35 nbsp Best Pizza Place ever!
First of all it is clean. Second is the service. I love that it is operated by a family: husband, wife and 3 of their sons. They are always friendly to customers, very helpful and ready to do good deals. Every time I order something or stop by to pick up my order, I feel like they really appreciate their customers and take care of their business. Prices are pretty cheap plus there are always lots of deals.
Thank you Pizza Guys Davis for the best Pizza Place!!!!!!!!!!! Users/MichelleVee

20140724 21:23:36 nbsp Consistently great pizza. I have had better for sure, but this place is my go to place in Davis. You even get surprised with an exceptional pizza every now and then. Users/JakeDuCharme
