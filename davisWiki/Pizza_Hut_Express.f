If you like greasy Pizzaesque substances, but hate human interaction, this is the place for you. Pizzas come out of the wall and you purchase them. Wow technology.

Unfortunately, their pizzas are mediocre and horribly over priced. For a more consistently tasty and fiscally responsible experience, try the Coffee House pizza. NOTE: someone may actually look at you in the coffee house, but you should be able to divert attention from yourself by not making eyecontact.

20081020 16:58:04 nbsp agreed with PatrickSing, Coho pizza is TERRIBLE. i dunno what this review is talking about but the pizza hut express is quite delicious. i always loved pizza hut pepperoni, so crunchy and flavorful. i come here often.  Users/CloudFire

20081114 13:19:30 nbsp Much agreed, the coffee house pizza is dirt, but at least a poor student can get more for less.  Pizza Hut is much better in terms of quality and pizzatocrust ratio (seriously, what is up with that huge crust at the coffee house? I paid for pizza, NOT crust!). Users/DirtDiver

20090512 02:25:59 nbsp The Pizzas from this Pizza Hut are at least consistant.  And if you ever dont get what you were expecting, the employees there will remake it for you on the spot, which only takes about five minutes.  As for interaction, there is always someone there if you need something, or have a question. Users/ShawnC
