West Davis

Avenue of Trees (and Beyond)
(7 miles) This path originates near Downtown downtown and traverses westward for about 7 miles along Russell Boulevard Russell all the way out to County Road 95a (well outside of Davis). A network of paths throughout West Davis, especially around the Village Homes area, connect to this path. The miles along the Avenue of Trees is perhaps the most scenic; also, theres a dirt path (separated from the paved path by a fence) that runners often take advantage of.
  Illuminated with street lamps as far west as Lake Boulevard
  Wide path ideal for baby strollers
  Rutted and uneven surface along Avenue of Trees due to the roots of Walnuts black walnut trees
  Watch out for crazed Bicycles bike riders!

North Davis

Covell Drainage Channel Loop
(1.4 miles oneway) The Covell Drainage Channel Trail Covell Drainage Channel runs across North Davis between Sycamore Lane and F Street (well north of West Covell Boulevard Covell Blvd). A bike path runs along the southern bank of the channel. However, for most of the year, you can run inside the channel on a Covell Drainage Channel Trail dirt path that meanders much of the way (there are some cobblestones to be dealt with). Also, A dirt path runs along the northern bank of the channel. Circumventing the channel on both banks makes a nice loop and can be done entirely on dirt.
  Very, very dark at night (unless youre on the bike path)
  Distance from one end to the other is approximately 1 3/8 miles as http://www.gmappedometer.com/?r555163 mapped on a pedometer mashup site.

Northstar Greenbelt
(2.53.5 miles) The bike path in the Northstar greenbelt runs through North Davis, north of Alvarado Avenue and west of F Street.
  Paved

  There are multiple loops, making it possible to adjust the total distance. A map of the lengths of the different segments is on the Northstar greenbelt Northstar greenbelt page


East Davis

Wildhorse Loop
(3.5 miles) This run loops around the Wildhorse Golf Club and much of northeast Davis. From the intersection of Pole Line Road Pole Line and East Covell Boulevard Covell, run north (away from Davis). Therell be countryside on your left and northeast Davis on your right. Eventually, the houses and apartments on your right will be replaced with a golf course. At the very northern side of the golf course, theres a dirt/gravel path that runs through the Wildhorse Agricultural Buffer. Run along this path. After about a mile, the path will curve towards the south and meet up with East Covell Boulevard Covell. Run west along Covell towards Pole Line Road Pole Line and your starting point.

  Half paved, half gravel/dirt
  When it rains, avoid the farm road as it gets much muddier than the golf course path.

Tracks
There are numerous tracks around, mostly dirt, for you to run on.

Toomey Field
(.25 miles) This is the only artificial surface track around.  They seem to be open all the time, and it is rarely very crowded.  Also, occasionally at night they leave the lights on for IM games, so it is well lit at times.

Davis High
(.25 miles)Davis High School has a rubberized composite track that can be used by the public.  There are no lights, so it is very dark at night. It used to be dirt but has since been redone

Oliver Wendell Holmes Middle School
(.25 miles) This is another dirt track that is strangely shaped like a square.  There is one flood light that partially illuminates this track, but it is not always on.  The track is not often used, so it is rarely if ever populated by more than two or three people.

Emerson Jr High also has a track. Its dirt and unpaved

ARC
(1 mile  7.65 laps) The Activities and Recreation Center features an indoor irregularlyshaped walking/Running running track thats convenient during the Night Time night time or in bad weather.
