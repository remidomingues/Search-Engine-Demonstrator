20080310 14:44:29 nbsp It is really sketchy that they wont give prices over the phone. I am aware that it is a company policy and it is not the fault of those who work there but it is really weird. Almost as if they want you to come in in order to talk you into buying more than you need.  Users/TaliaMacMath

20080324 16:59:55 nbsp the girls are rude, the prices are ridiculous and they pressure sale. I did not feel welcome I felt really creeped out. the salon looks really nice but that is about it. The spa treatments are kind of cool but not worth listening to them go on and on for hours about something you cant afford. Users/sara87

20080324 19:46:25 nbsp Here is my first attempt as the wiki private investigator: Prices as of 3/24 are $79 membership fee plus $79 a month.  Thats a special, its usually $139 for each.  Yeah...you have to go with the package, so you cant only do mystic or only UV.  Also, they have a creepy photo with all the girls that work there in pink velour track suits.  The girl that helped me was nice, but it was a typical scripted sale.  Its a tanning place, theyre necessary evils. Users/JillWeinstein

20080401 10:58:55 nbsp Here is my rant. My bf went in here to get me a gift certificate and the girls in there gave him three free tans and a steam spa free. He then bought my gift card and way overpriced tanning lotion because they talked him into it. He came in with me to get mine since he had free stuff to use up, but when we walked in I was shocked with how unprofessional the girls were. They were literally ALL OVER my bf and acted like I wasnt even there. Once he got into his room a girl asked me, Oh, are you waiting for something? I was furious. I will never go to this place again.  Users/tgdavis

20080404 12:18:32 nbsp Ive been a member since it opened and really enjoy it.  The girls are really nice and the spa services are awesome.  Im pretty sure you can buy individual services and not the monthly membership.  Ive heard them quote individual spa services, a tanning only monthly membership, and a package of tanning sessions.  Im not sure what all the prices for the nonspa member services are but I think the Hydration Station is $25 for an individual session.  Users/havanese

20080505 21:35:17 nbsp Is there a later closing time for members?  Cuz every time I call to ask when they close, the salesgirl inevitably asks if Im a member, I mention that Ive been there before so does that make me a member?  She responds with....well its already closed.   Users/DavisGirl26

20080516 20:33:11 nbsp Ive been a member for a few months and I really like it.  The services are awesome and the staff is super friendly.  I really like how relaxing it is.  The massage beds are great because you dont have to worry about a person doing the massaging and can completely relax.  They have headphones with satellite radio in all the rooms which makes everything even more relaxing.  It is also really nice that the staff try to remember everyones name and greet you as soon as you walk in.  Great place!  Users/ToniAbney

20080517 17:29:54 nbsp I think that when ever you call they always ask if you are a member.  I really like what they have.  It has all these spa services not just tanning.  At first it was anoying because they ask you to come in and and do a tour or something like that, but they are a spa and not a tanning salon.  I think if you live in davis this place is great because its kind of a break away from davis. Users/davis2004

20080629 11:35:18 nbsp I really like this place and Im thinking about becoming a member. Everyone there is really nice and the services put me in la la land. The other thing is that they have so many other locations and if I become a member I can go to any of them. I highly recommend the AquaMassage! Users/Adaleen

20080716 15:19:10 nbsp WARNING: When I originally tried to cancel my membership, they talked me into pausing it which sounded like a great deal, and said that if i changed my mind, give them 15 days notice. Lone and behold, when I call to cancel again because it just costs too much, they now need a 30day notice. So now they get a months membership and a cancellation fee from me WHEN I NOW HATE THIS PLACE. Wonderful. Yes, I should have read the fine print, I should have brought my Sherlock Holmes spy glass.....So not worth it, especially when you do the math and realize you could buy a latte every single day of the month and it would still be cheaper than this! P.S. mystic tan makes you orange... Users/everdrw

20080724 09:41:13 nbsp WOW.......i have had COUNTLESS people tell me not to go to this place. It nice...it will get the job done...but its up the BUTT expensive and the sales pitch has to go.....i am a client at another salon in town and am pretty happy with it, I have never had any issues so I do not think i will leave, i was curious but after reading these reviews and the personal reviews from my friends who have visited, i have changed my mind. Sounds way too complicated and messy. is it true they do not give pricing over the phone? what a huge inconvinience? Users/Leah2008

20080825 20:25:34 nbsp Personally, after trying out all of their services I cant complain about the customer service, overall atmosphere, or pricing.  The girls working there were incredibly friendly and did exactly what they are supposed to do...no one likes a sales pitch, but it is their JOB to try and sell their services, not give everyone free usage of the spa.  The spa overall was very clean and well kept and everyone was very accomodating.  I would recommend the spa to any one of my friends as I feel it is reasonably priced and the services are well worth it! Users/krnkhl176

20080903 08:02:16 nbsp I was scared away from joining this salon based on the reviews here, and stuck with another tanning salon but went to Planet Beach for mystic because I like it more than what the other place had (the mystic actually makes you less orange and splotchy than other spray tans, and if you have a base tan it will just make you a more brownish tan). Then I went in one day and the owner told me I should get a membership, and when I seemed hesitant she told me that it was $69 a month, when one spray tan is $25. My other place charged me a monthly few of $35, so I thought it was a better deal, but when I considered that I had to spend more to go into higher power beds I realized that I would be saving a lot of money if I went here. Tanning in even the highest power beds and spray tans are unlimited! My other place charged almost $20 for the highest power bed. So if you tan and spray tan at least twice a month it pays for the membership itself. They also have good fans here, so you dont get as hot when you tan. The owner is also super nice. I love this place! Users/court

20081021 12:38:32 nbsp Planet beach is really sketchy. Its a nice place (but dont confuse nice with new) The customer service is based on what you purchase. i was a member for a few months.(mystic that is all) Girls/Owner are happy moods when i was interested in purchasing something, any other day it was as if i was speaking to robots. Their mystic is worth it (just when you need it, 80 a month should be spent somewhere else), however it took them like three months to replace a lighting problem. My philosophy, If you cant afford to keep up the place with the prices you charge then i dont want your services. Other than the mystic the place is pretty much over priced.. and over ratted.Users/bri

20081128 13:57:37 nbsp Ive been a member here for a while now, and I keep reading all these bad things about them.  I love this place!  They even had specials for black fri.  I think that their mystic tan is the best it town!  I hate having to lay down for 15 min for a tan so I do their mystic, it takes 60 seconds!  Definitely do the Hydration first though, best results.  And to everyone that is saying their expensive, really, their cheaper than other places in town.  If you want to buy single sessions, of course theyre going to be expensive, but you can buy the services in packages or the membership its sooo much cheaper.  It seems expensive with the membership only because you have to pay a lump sum, but think about how much you throw down everytime you go in it adds up, but if you actually use the services its worth the 60 bucks !  Ive been a member to a couple of places, and they never had spa services, and I still payed more (over 80.00) just for tanning.  If you really want to take care of your body and skin, then take advantage of their services, I mean really go in there and use it.  They even sit down and help you what you want.  I have bad skin, and Im using their skin care line... Amazing!!!  I love that its all organic ingredients, they have this acne control product, and its almost like proactive but better, it doesnt have any fragrance.  There is even product to help with cellulite!  Give them a chance!  I love it there! Users/davis2004

20090408 13:48:14 nbsp Ive been a member of planet beach for a few months, and I like it, but I have to agree it is WAY overpriced.  I mean, how much does it really cost them to run some spa machines?  The package I have is unlimited spa and tanning, and its about $79/mo.  I think the tanningonly pkg is fiftysomething a month.  Also, to clarify, I just found out (because I am away from home, and tried to go to another PB location), that your PB membership is ONLY good at your home location.  NOT good for any others.  That is by far the most annoying thing about PB.  The spa services are all machines, so they are not true spa services, and they all run about 2030 minutes per session.  Personally, I think the spa treatments are overrated and not worth the price, but unfortunately I have become addicted to the hydration station, so I cant downgrade my membership.  I wish there were other places comparable to PB so that we had other choices, because this place is definately capitalizing on the fact that they are the only kind of their type. Users/Lisa

20090408 13:51:09 nbsp also, is davis 2004 affiliated with PB in some way???  they sounds a little salespitchy to me, advocating PB a little strong... Users/Lisa

20090409 16:47:22 nbsp This place is cool as far as Im concerned. Yes the girls are a bit over the top (and that pink velour photo is weird), but theyre really nice. Just dont get pressured into spending more than you can afford and you should be fine. IMHO nothing beats going to the ARC and then over to PB for a massage/tan/whatever. Compare its prices with those of the other tanning places in Davis, its absolutely no contest. Also, all the lotions they have on sale here and at every salon Ive ever seen are available on Amazon, Ebay, etc. YES they are the same lotions, dont let people tell you theyre not! What if everyone got a massage every day? I think wed all be a little better off.  Users/YesItsMe

20090601 18:19:52 nbsp The Mystic Tan booth works really well here! Its so hit and miss at tanning salons, but this one definitely works well.  Users/sr
