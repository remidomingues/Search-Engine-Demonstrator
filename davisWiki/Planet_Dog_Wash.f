20080813 19:45:59 nbsp I recently heard about this place from several of my pet sitting clients. I took a dog client of mine here for the first time and was not dissapointed. I like it so much I decided to add a page on wiki. My experience here was very positive and Obi, and Cody were happy to receive a bath. The pet wash station is clean and consumer friendly offering pet owners many opitions including shampoo, deskunk, condition, oatmeal shampoo, and even a dryer. The starting cost for a wash is $2.50 and increases per minute. The rubber matting and dog ramp is a great addition for all pets. My only complaint is the water pressure is a bit low to quickly wash your dog. Overall, a great addition to the Davis community and an alternative to yard or bathtub baths. The best part is bonding time with your pet and leaving the messy cleanup and hair there. 4/5 stars   Users/ElizabethBarthel

20091014 14:56:56 nbsp i just took my dog there this morning because he rolled in the mud at the dog park. man this place is cleaner than my HOUSE. getting him into the basin was a challenge, he wouldnt jump up. But once he was up there and locked in, it was awesome!!!! I spent $10 and he got an oatmeal shampoo and rinse, and blow dry. He is squeaky clean. Ive never seen a pet wash at a carwash and vacuum place before, its FABULOUS!!!!!!! I agree on the low water pressure. Users/StephHolm

20101009 13:57:00 nbsp My dog doesnt like baths so much, but its so easy to giver her one here. She can be locked in and wont slip around  how fantastic! And the little caged area is nice, she cant get away when I try to brush her. Definitely the best thing in Davis for my pup.  Users/ChristyMarsden

20110625 00:42:06 nbsp I went to wash my dog here today. The place is very clean, accessible, and the blow dryer is very strong. Although I wish there were brushes to use (bring a brush with you.)
This place is excellent and such a unique idea. I got to clean my dog as well as my car!  Users/TraNgu
