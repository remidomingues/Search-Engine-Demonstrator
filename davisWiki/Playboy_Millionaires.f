As selfproclaimed rivals of ChoadBot, the Playboy Millionaires brought the the fog machine to the scene.  Users/GriffinWalker Griffin Walker, who joined Jazi and Joe shortly after the band was formed, was a cool & collected addition to this rockin powerhouse. Dan Glendening also performed with the band at live shows when he plays the fog machine.

The Playboy Millionaires played their last show on September 24, 2005 at Delta of Venus.
