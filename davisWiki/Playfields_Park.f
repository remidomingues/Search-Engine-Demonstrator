Playfields Park is a public park in South Davis. The parking lot and vehicular entrance are located on Research Park Drive. There is a nice field there for flying kites.  The park was dedicated in 1996. It appears that the citys open container ordinance does not apply to this park.

20071217 12:39:00 nbsp This park is great.  I live in Halsey Circle, which is right next to this park, and go there every once in a while to play or jog.  Lots of space and bike paths that run around the perimeter.  Usually pretty empty during the day with only a few people playing with/walking their dogs. But fills up for those softball/baseball games.

Unfortunately, this is also the site where my red coleman cooler from the 70s was stolen by a bunch of kids. ( They were the only other group in the park at the time.  My friends and I were having a preThanksgiving left over gathering by the playground.  We left for a little bit to play some basketball and upon returning, my cooler was gone.  The cooler was filled with drinks of the 21+ variety and the kids were old enough to drive because they had a car in the parking lot but obviously underaged.  The cooler was given to me by my father and is sentimental, its been in my family for about 30 years.  I just want the cooler back.  If anyone knows anything please contact me!  Users/stellah

20090126 21:41:14 nbsp oh man, this place... I go jogging around the soccer field on weekends, and every month, i seem run into one or two used condoms thrown out in the field, just make sure you check what your dog brings back when youre both playing freesbee or whatever.

20090603 19:41:50 nbsp Does anyone know if residence can use the new turf soccer field. I live next to play fields and I really enjoyed going to the soccer field but it has been closed off because of the new turf and I cant find when itll be open to the general public. The sign says reservations so Im confused. It also seems that they closed off the back entrance and it seems they are attempting to enclose the whole field. Might I ask why? Im getting the hint that this field isnt for everyone... I believe thats wrong because Ive been living next to playfields for a while and I thought the parks was open to the general public. Why did they enclose the whole field with the fence and blocked off the back entrance? If I jump the fence and play soccer alone when people arent using the field am I breaking the law? Please leave a comment Ill check back but I feel really sad. Users/dsbai
