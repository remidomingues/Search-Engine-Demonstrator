To incentivize people to pledge, Kickstarter allows adding rewards for different pledge amounts.  The better our rewards, the more likely more people will pledge.  In the Davis Radical Cheerleaders spirit of the wiki, lets come up with some additional rewards together.

Do you have a skill or cool idea for something we could do to sweeten the deal and help people to pledge? #letus Help us brainstorm!

One thing we have noticed is that the $10 and $20 pledge levels are the most popular.  Can you think of better rewards to encourage more pledges at this level?

Ideas for rewards

Please contribute your suggestions for pledge rewards.  Remember that they can be limited to a certain number if necessary, and check what we already thought of below for inspiration.  Here are some that might be good to use:

  $50: Ride the Davis Bike Loop with a Wiki Gnome ADDED
  $50: Photo walk with a local photographer
  $5: Davis Wiki page about topic of your choice
