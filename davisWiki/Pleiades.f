The Pleiades name comes from the constellation. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiades) In the game of Ultimate, teams are allowed seven players on the field at all times, like the Seven Sisters in the sky. More on Ultimate rules can be found at USA Ultimate: http://www.usaultimate.org/index.html

The Pleiades hosted the Northwest Regionals here in Davis on May 7th and 8th, 2004. The NW region (which includes Bay Area Section: UCD, UC Santa Cruz, Stanford, UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco) is one of the toughest regions in the country. Other top programs who competed at regionals will be the University of Oregon, University of Washington and University of British Columbia. The top three finishers in the region earn a coveted bid to nationals. Its all about west coast ultimate! So if you want to see a good game of ultimate, just stop by the UCD fields (primarily Hutchison, Russell, and Dairy) and cheer on your local frisbee stars.


The Davis Womens Ultimate program grew enough, so that the Pleiades divided into an A team (Pleiades) and a B team (Hyades). Below is a picture of the Pleiades at Regionals 2011.
