20060313 09:30:30 nbsp My hot water heater died, so after calling around and getting prices, I decided to go with these guys because they were local and they had the best prices.  They were able to come out quickly.  The quoted me an hour to replace the water heater, but it actually took about an hour and a half (not at all a problem).  The service guy was professional and wellmannered.  I would use them again.  Note: Their prices do not include any city permits that may be needed. Users/AlexPomeranz

20070118 14:52:42 nbsp My water heater was going bad right after the Winter Break, but they were able to fit me in despite the rush of jobs they had. They have a good quote on a replacement water heater and installed it the next day on time. I would use them again in the future.  Users/CarlosOverstreet

20070119 13:00:40 nbsp Ive never had an experience with this business, but I must say, I really wish they wouldnt drive those ambulances. Sure, it could be called clever, but every time I see one parked in front of a house, especially a house near mine, I get very alarmed, thinking that something awful happened to a friend or neighbor until I realize that the car is not a hospital ambulance, but rather the plumbing ambulance. Its like an unintended cruel and crude joke is being played on people. Another perspective that I dont know if I personally have, but have thought of: Using a remodeled ambulance for a plumbing business could be viewed as a devaluation of human life, as if a plumbing emergency is somehow as important as someones wellbeing. I dunno, it has just always bothered me seeing these vehicles around. (  Users/EliseKane

20070316 12:01:44 nbsp These people are great. They are easy to reach, come out immediately, are extremely professional (they even put on shoe covers every time they enter your house), and totally fair. Highly recommended.  Users/TawnyMata

20070323 10:27:21 nbsp I have to say, this is the best plumber I have ever worked with. We had a toilet that was clogged, and after the guy tried to auger it out, it was determined that there was something really hard (like a glass object) stuck in the curve such that the whole toilet had to be replaced. He gave me a recommendation as to which toilet I should buy at Home Depot, then returned the next day to install the toilet. He discovered a defect in the new toilets tank, so I had to go back and exchange it. So he made three trips, and he wound up charging us less than the book labor price he quoted us originally! This guy was courteous, friendly and very professional! I highly recommend these guys. I even like their gimmick of a paramediclooking vehicle! Users/DougBarbieri

20070403 nbsp Mark H., Certified Plumbing Doctor (its on his business card!), came out today to help with an appliance hookup gone bad. What two college graduates couldnt accomplish he literally fixed in 10 minutes. Then he wouldnt take a fee or a tip, and instead asked us to call when we have a bigger job. I definitely recommend this company, and think the ambulances are a great touch. Users/TomHinds

20071007 18:26:48 nbsp these guys are a rip off!!!!! I had to call them out back to my house 3 times last week. and each time they charged me about a bill or more! I just cant understand why they couldnt have fixed it the first day that they were here. Do they know what they are doing? I feel they purposely didnt fix it so they they would have to come back and continue charging me more money! Im only a college student! I dont have that much money! Not only that because they didnt fix it the first time, water continued to leak and now my carpet is molded and I have to spend money to replace that too! please if you are planning to call these guys make sure they do everything the first time around.  Users/anniebanhie

20071012 15:55:51 nbsp they didnt fix my problem. im calling a different plumber because they are too expensive for me to continuously call back.  Users/anniebanhie

20071221 15:05:06 nbsp I had a very good experience with these guys.  They showed up exactly when they said they would, put on disposable booties over their shoes when entering the house and otherwise were very professional.  Solved my issue in about 30 minutes for a fair price.   Users/RonLee

20080107 14:26:41 nbsp BEWARE they will charge an estimate or just to take a look.  I had the fawcet spout break on my tub and called them to take a look and give me an estimate.  The conversation went like we can probably just fix it for while we are there to take a look.  I ask them to call me with a price before they do any work.  Later I get a call from the repairman and he says the tile is soft right around the tub spout and they wont fix it because the backing is soft.  (of course its a little soft water had been leaking from the tub spout till it broke off)  So I ask how much and they say they will send me an estimate.  A few days later I get an estimate for $1800 to replace my entire bath tub suround and all the pipes and Fawcets etc.  Then to add to the pain I get a bill for $85 for the (free?) estimate.  I called the business and was told that that how much they charge to come out.  You can call almost any other plumber in the phone book for a free estimate so I dont know how they do business.

I decided to take a closer look my self and just unscrewed the pipe that was broken (it was still sticking from the wall)  and took it to Hibbert Lumber where they helped me match up a new piece of pipe the right length.  The tub spout cost $6 and the pipe was another dollar or so.  For less than $10 and a just a couple of minutes I fixed it my self.  The wall behind the tile dried out and I put some silicone seal around the new spout to.  I saved $1790 by questioning their estimate.  Users/LongtimeDavisite

20080129 09:26:26 nbsp these guys are great, reliable and trustworthy.  I had them run a gas line under my house and they figured out how to do it better for less money than the other quotes that wanted to run a whole new gas line from the meter.  Users/AuctionJack

20080203 22:00:33 nbsp I strongly recommend AGAINST Plumbing M.D.. I had a simple root problem in my sewer line which they turned into a nightmare. They damaged my sewer line and they refused to take responsibility.  I spoke to the manager in Dixon and he was verbally abusive. I will NEVER use them again. I will make sure that all my friends know NOT TO USE THEM! On the other hand Poot & Scoot Plumbing and Drain Cleaning came out and solve the problem which Plumbing M.D. caused. Use Poot & Scoot Plumbing and Drain Cleaning Users/CarolBlake

20080320 14:01:00 nbsp Had them do some relatively simple work.  The were very polite and kept their appointment.  Even calling back when they were a few minutes late.  Unfortunately, the gentleman pulled out his book and said the work I wanted would cost over $400.  Since one of the issues was a leaking faucet under the sink I went ahead.  He was done in an hour and 15 minutes.  Over $400 for a little over an hour and negligible parts. Users/AugustWest

20090928 14:26:14 nbsp I have used these guys in the past with good (but pricey) results. NO MORE. I recently had them install a dishwasher for a tenant (dishwasher on site, needing to remove the old and plug in the new one)  They charged me nearly $400 bucks! For less than 2h work! I guess I am the idiot for hiring them but I will NEVER EVER USE THEM AGAIN Users/Olof

20101214 07:46:26 nbsp I paid this company $277 to replace two cartridges in lavatory faucets in 4/10.  In 11/10 one of them malfunctioned and the faucet became inoperable.  I told them I expected them to repair their work at no additional cost to me, in compliance with California law.  They demanded an additional $180 to correct their own work.  Only by threatening a law suit could I get them to repair their defective work at no additional cost to me.  In addition, the owner was rude and offensive in speaking with my wife on the phone.  I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY TO MY WORST ENEMY. Users/PaulGuyer

20110301 15:14:46 nbsp Would never use this company again or recommend to anyone under any circumstances. They are very unprofessional, caused more problems after only partially fixing the original one (their fix broke down couple of days later). Calling the manager Justin did not help, they are unreasonable and argumentative in a sophomoric way. Users/jengmale

20110907 19:48:32 nbsp  We used Plumbing MD to install a tankless water heater. Although expensive, they did a great job. Part of our astronomical bill was a free plumbing check upa $200 value. They came today for that free checkup. The only thing they found was the need to replace the water measuring device in the hallway bath. This is probably a $20 part from Home Depot. They wanted $203 to replace it. I sent the guy packing. The plumber was very nice but what a rip off. I would be very careful using this company. I probably wont use them again. Sketchy  business practice.  Users/lindad

20111130 09:48:34 nbsp I completely agree with the positive reviews of Poot & Scoot, and the generally negative reviews of Plumbing M.D. on the wiki.

When my drain was blocked my wife pulled Plumbing MDs number out of a hat. They responded quickly, however they claimed they ran 100 feet of drain snake and did not encounter the blockage.  They charged us $125 for an hour of work without any noticeable effect, then tried to sell my wife on a $400 service plan whereby we would receive a %10 discount on future work done and get priority service.  In other words, in the future it would be easier and faster for me to pay them to not accomplish anything for a reasonable $400.  They also tried to sell a $300 video inspection of our pipes  however I understand from other plumbers that when the drain is blocked you are unlikely to see anything on the camera.  It definitely felt like they were trying to squeeze us for as much money as they could.

In contrast, once we took the time to ask friends and read some reviews about Poot and Scoot, we wish we had called him in the first place.  Dave lived up to the accolades by responding cheerfully on a Saturday morning, letting himself in as I was at work, clearing the blockage in the drain (which was only 70 feet in  unknown why Plumming MD couldnt fix it with 100 feet of snake), and leaving a clean work area and a reasonable bill on the step on his way out.

Also in stark contrast with Pumming MD: Dave will not charge if he cant fix your problem, and guarantees his work for 6 months (he will come back out at no cost if the drain gets plugged again). This shows his confidence in his own ability (he says he has only been stumped by a drain twice in 6 years), and IMHO is all you need to know when selecting a new plumber.

Please support excellent business practices and local small business and pick Poot & Scoot as your next plumber.  Users/jamesrbronson

20130203 13:05:49 nbsp DO NOT USE THESE GUYS! Their free estimate is just a ruse to get you to bring out one of their guys, who takes a cursory look and writes up an order for standard work on the type of problem you reported. Just before Thanksgiving, I had guests coming and the shower/tub in my bathroom was not draining properly. I called Plumbing MD and explained that a handyman had already tried to snake the drain. The dispatcher said someone would come between 3:00 and 5:00 p.m. to diagnose the problem. If I didnt need or decided not to use their service, there would be no fee. The plumber (Mark) went in to check the drain, and told me I needed $125 worth of plumbing services. Trusting his professional opinion, I signed off on the work. He went upstairs, and after a short time came down and said the drain was fixed. I asked (he did not offer) to check it out before he left. We turned on the water, and within seconds there was a 1 pool around the drain and a good 1/4 at the back of the tub. Mark proudly repeated, See, its draining fine now as the water accumulated. I was floored. I said this was exactly what it was doing when he started, and it was NOT fine  No one should be standing in water while showering. I refused to pay because he hadnt done anything. He insisted my standards were too high, and called the office to get someone else in to take a look. About 20 minutes later, two more plumbers showed up. One (Les) was introduced as the supervisor and a drain expert. He agreed the shower was draining too slowly and said hed see what he could do. He popped off the filter with his fingers, and then the drain worked fine. He said it was fixed now, so I should pay. I said the drain was working the same as it was before they came  either I never needed a plumber or there was a problem they did not improve. Les became angry and hostile. Mark started to say something, and Les barked at him to be quiet. I demanded to hear what Mark had to say. When finally allowed to speak, he paused and said he couldnt go against his supervisor, and I should pay because he had worked on my drain. What had he done? He removed a small amount of hair from the drain filter, then popped off the filter (apparently without rechecking the drain action), and then ran a line down the pipe (which he knew had already been done). In a nasty manner, Les said Id better pay because I had signed a contract for this work. I said I signed because I believed Mark made a professional determination that I needed a plumber, but now he admits he wrote up the order after merely turning the shower on and confirming it drained slowly. If he had simply used his fingers to remove a little hair from the filter and then pop the filter off, he would have seen the problem was a cheap ($5) filter, and I did not need a plumber. Les sneered that the minute one of their plumbers stick their fingers in the drain filter, even to remove a small clump of hair, they have performed work by Plumbing MDs standards  for which there is a $96 house call fee. Huh? The plumber cant even remove a clump of hair without being paid?! So much for the free assessment! Les asked again, in a threatening tone, whether I was going to pay. I threw them out, and called the office asking to speak with a higherup supervisor. The dispatcher connected me to Justin (who turns out to be the owners son). I thanked Justin for taking my call, but before I could say another word, he cut me off and said I just talked to three of my crew, and understand you are being unreasonable and belligerent and refusing to pay! I interrupted him and said, Wait a minute, you havent even heard my story yet! He said he didnt need to hear my story because he had already talked to his guys. He resumed the tirade, and would not let me speak. I finally shouted BE QUIET AND LET ME TALK. He responded, Who do you think you are? No one tells ME to be quiet! and asked if I was going to pay his guys. I said no, not under these circumstances. He started his tirade again, and I hung up. He called back, and said in a threatening tone: We can do this the easy way or the hard way  are you going to pay my guys? I asked what the hard way was, and he said it meant going to court. I said that was fine with me, and hung up. I sent a complaint to the company website, and received a rambling form letter from the owner, justifying their fee scale (which I hadnt challenged) and reciting a sob story about how they have employees to pay. At the end, though, he got nasty, accusing me of theft and threatening to turn me over to the police and District Attorney if I didnt pay up. I tried to settle with a token payment (which he rejected). He then sent a lien notice on the property that I am renting. Not wanting legal trouble, I had no choice but to pay. These men are EVIL BULLIES. Stay far away!!!!!
