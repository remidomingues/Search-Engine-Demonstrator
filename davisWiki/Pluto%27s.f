Plutos serves restaurants food in a fun, stylish atmosphere. Think The Jetsons or Stargazing and Space Sightings Buck Rogers. The food is served cafeteriastyle. You first take a guest check (order form) as you enter. Then you find the food(s) you desire and tell the server(s) behind the counter what you wish. Theyll hand you your order and fill out your order form. Give the form to the cashier when you pay. The advantage of cafeteriastyle service is that it eliminates the labor needed to bring food to tables.  A worker will bus your table after you leave.

The guest check order forms are now obsolete, though still provided. The preparers have forms that create a carbon copy, one of which is given to you and the other of which stays with your food until you pay.

The menu is divided into these categories:

Greens & Things Plutos salads are incredible. You can choose up to seven additions to either romaine or a mix. Delicious, sauces, bread and an option for meat finish them off. These are delicious, not to mention an excellent value.

Meats & Poultry They have a nice hot gas grill operating right in front of you to cook your meat. The options include flank steak, sausages, chicken, and roast turkey.

Veggies & Spuds This category includes all sorts of delicious side dishes. They usually even have brussel sprouts. The garlic potato rings and onion rings are incredible. Note that the onion rings come with spicy BBQ sauce by default; mild is available on request.

Sweets Lemon bars, brownies and cookies fill a glasscovered cake case next to the register. Prices are a little high for the quality of the treats.

Quenchers Water, beer and a good selection of nonstandard sodas are available, amongst other things.

Little Astronauts (the childrens menu)

And it is so fun. Really, you walk in, grab a menu form, and as you make your rounds to each different category, the chef behind the counter fills out your form. Then you check out at the counter and voila! Eat your stellar meal.  If you eat there often, be sure to ask to be put in the book.  Theyll enter your name in the binder and after 10 meals, your 11th is free!

Plutos also has a handful of other restaurants in nearby galaxies. For a full listing, check out their webpage.

20090119 14:09:31 nbsp I think the salads taste much better than the sandwiches (which tend to be a little dry).  A great place overall, considering there is always a line!   Users/renee415

20090202 13:56:11 nbsp Great place for a wellpriced salad. Lots of ingredients to choose from and they always have an interesting salad dressing flavor. However, during peak hours, it gets really busy and you basically have to shout at the chef to get your order in. Users/AmanpreetSingh

20090314 20:13:09 nbsp Very yummy salads and other tasty treats.  Highly customizable.  I like their sandwiches too.  Their lines are seriously long though.  On more than one occasion, Ive wanted to just get a dessert item here (which requires you to request it from the cashier), but would have had to wait through the entire line to get it.  I eventually gave up hope and went elsewhere.  The line is much slower than it needs to be because the cashier, in addition to taking your money, is also performing a lot of other tasks as well.  So it can take 23 minutes to get an order rung up.  If they were to give these duties to someone else, the entire line would move much faster, and I would buy food here more often. Users/IDoNotExist

20090526 01:28:26 nbsp found a bug in my salad today. Users/Yesenia
    That adds protein!  Not everyone gets one.  Users/IDoNotExist

20090531 07:47:39 nbsp Two words: Garlic fries.
They are to die for.

Also, beware of the salads. A side salad is easily enough for a big eater like me, so going for the full size is best reserved for sharing. The rosemary focaccia is absolutely delicious. And of course, my favorite thing to do is come in and try the running special sandwich. Ive had some pretty good results with them, never a bad one, certainly.

But yes. Did I mention the garlic fries?
...good. Users/KBathory

20090602 21:46:03 nbsp Their salads are great and the employees are really cool, in my awesome opinion. Users/RonB
20090605  BEWARE!  A handful of my friends and I all got food poisoning from sandwiches we got from this place last weekend.  In talking to others, I found out we werent the only ones.  I also heard that this isnt the first report of people getting sick from Plutos food.  Too bad! :(  I loved their food.  But its not worth what we all went through last weekend (and it was unquestionably the sandwiches).

20090620 17:01:12 nbsp One of the big words on the wall is ORGANIC. Are any of their foods organic? Ive asked them before but never received an answer. The implication is that the salad bar is all organic; the word is right above it, I think. Users/jsg718

20090627 10:44:57 nbsp No, Plutos isnt organic. I used to really like this place, but then the salads started getting skimpier, and they decided to start charging extra for walnuts... its not that fabulous anymore. Most of the time I feel like Im paying more for the dressing than for the salad (they dont know the meaning of go easy on the dressing) and some of the vegetables sometimes appear to be previously frozen/thawed. I personally like the completely bottomless salad at Crepeville (also not organic, but larger and fresher) and the new salad bar at the coop much better. Even the salad bar at the Nugget on Covell is looking better these days, for the value. Users/calvin2

20090627 11:47:38 nbsp Ive got food poisoning from plutos twice this year.  I believe its due to the way they handle the meat.  Tried veggie salad yesterday and didnt get sick (amazingly..).  It concerns me that the salad is located on the floor. Users/shraken

20090717 17:41:26 nbsp I tend to agree with Calvin2. Plutos seems to have gone down hill in all but one area, which is the strength and quality of the bleach odor that greets you upon entering into the restaurant. Were it not for outdoor seating, I would not eat here ever. If you have a lung infection, you might disinfect your lungs by breathing the air in Plutos for a few minutes, but this is not medical advice. Consult your doctor first. Users/MichaelPlotkin

20090720 20:00:11 nbsp While a bit pricey for what you get, this has some of the best food in town. Everything is real fresh. Users/longboardlover

20090815 22:30:50 nbsp the meat always has a lot of fat on it, the kind that is not chewable in any shape form or matter. And i agree with shraken i have definitly gotten food poisoning. but i think it was from the water and the way the cups are washed , if that is possible... Users/lajolla4joya

20100129 11:54:11 nbsp I really hate this place.  Its basically a cafeteria, but you pay more and its less convenient.  And depending on the Cafeteria, the food is probably worse as well.  I personally avoid at all costs  if you want a salad, go to a supermarket and save five bucks. Users/rfrazier

20100323 11:52:16 nbsp One of the reasons people get sick from Plutos is the meat sitting out on the counter for sometimes HOURS! The heat lamp they use does not have sufficient heat. I have never liked Plutos Users/ashleyinthemist

20100331 10:04:14 nbsp We have enjoyed lunches, especially salads, from Plutos and have never had a problem.  It has a fun atmosphere and there is lots do around after dining.   Users/willows

20100512 11:54:38 nbsp i LOVE Plutos!! The staff is amazing and always friendly how would you feel if all these hungry eyes were staring at you??  The line gets long but its worth it.  I am shocked to see that people are getting sick from their ingredients, I have never gotten sick from the food and have been eating there for years, at least twice a week.  Plutos is a great alternative to all the fastfood options that are awful for our bodies..  Users/LRosales

20100613 00:02:53 nbsp went here with a friend...she got a salad which were humongous. but i dont think ill waste $6 on a salad that i can make for free. i got their chicken sandwich and it was so dry that it was literally absorbing all my saliva in my mouth. it was also very tiny though the lettuce was very fresh.

if you tried Burgers & Brews garlic fries then Plutos garlic fries is equivalent to cow dung. not saying its not edible...but the status between the two just cannot be compared. Users/binladen

20100707 17:21:29 nbsp Salads are good and reasonably priced. Meat is bland, but a good value. Vegetables are overcooked, but again, cheap. One veg mix is mostly squash and red pepper, the other is a gray broccoli cauliflower carrot medley. Macaroni is like that orange KFC stuff, and actually not as appealing as Stouffers (I know some people eat that stuff, and some dont. If you dont eat Stouffers, dont eat Plutos.). The mashed potatoes are sort of nice with some redskinned chucks, slightly on the salty side. Gravy tastes like a mix. The focaccia and the sourdough are good quality. Desserts are pretty good and cheap. Other than that, the warm food is like what you serve if you volunteer at a soup kitchen over the holidays. The staff are incredibly friendly considering the bombardment of customers talking at them over the glass barriers. The air conditioning is not adequate for these people, and Im not surprised that someone got sick considering the ambient temperature when I have visited. If youre picky, stick to salads and sandwiches. The manager is not very friendly, but not especially rude. Sides are really cheap. The breaded chicken astro thingies off the kids menu are good in a fastgrub way (nice on a salad), and the curly fries with fresh garlic are what they should be, but you will get a larger portion if you order them as a separate side. A side salad with meat should be enough dinner. The full size salad is like a personal garden. Drink refills are free!, and the patio is nice if you dont mind close quarters. Lots of kiddies, prams, strange audible lectures to children, and wasted food left on tables with stacks of soiled napkins, and absence of tips for the help. Users/seesharp

20100806 15:24:28 nbsp This is a good place to go for something fresh and quick. I always get the balsamic or cilantrolime dressing on farmers market greens on whatever they have in season. Salads are served with local bread from Village Bakery. Also, I really like how they try to have mostly fresh ingredients (like fresh beets vs. canned ones), although I think theyve scaled down the portion sizes this past year which is a little disappointing.  Users/AmberMa

20100811 11:46:48 nbsp Love Plutos, have eaten here a lot over the years. About half of their staff is good, and half is horrible. They just flat out dont care. You can walk up to the counter, and the cooks are talking to one another, know youre there, but dont even take your order. They move slow and sometimes you can tell that they really dont want to me there. I have noticed that it seems to be by shift, and it depends on the time of the day you go. Its usually the people on the sandwich side. Management is usually nice though. Also, I havent felt good twice after eating here, I think the chicken that sits out all day on the salad bar can be dangerous as it gets to room temperature, Im not sure though. Users/aggie2009

20100812 23:05:11 nbsp A forgettable place to get quick and mildly healthy meals that are a tad too pricey for their own good. A large salad (choice of veggie base, ?# of toppings, choice of meat, and bread) will cost you at least $6, if Im not mistaken. This is of course, nonsensical since you could make an entire weeks worth of salads with $6, but then were all lazy and irrational people  myself included. Beyond the salads there are sandwiches that are also equally overpriced but unlike the salads are lacking in flavor. In my experience the chicken and turkeybased sandwiches have generally been a bit too dry.

Overall Plutos joins the already swelling cast of mediocre Davis joints that arent terrible (and at times may be genuinely tasty) but cost a few dollars too much.   Users/blastoff

 I would love to see what kind of salad you make for $6, especially with adding meat AND purporting to make salad for a week (you would also have to include some nuts, which breaks the budget right there) Daubert

20100819 14:21:29 nbsp I LOVE plutos! Honestly, you pay an even price for a very large salad. There are endless options, and the dressings and breads are always ALWAYS delicious. I would recommend getting the main salad (its barely more expensive than the side) and then saving some for later. Dont even try to save the foccacia they give you for later though...itll be so good, youll eat it in two seconds ;) Users/RachaelLeonie

20101109 19:59:58 nbsp A caveat: if you are allergic to any one of their salad ingredients I recommend vigilance as the workers are haphazardly tossing salads all day. In other words, things fly around. I found some unrequested sweet walnuts mixedin with my order (unknowingly bit into one, actually). Only bothered me insofar that I dislike finding unknown surprises in my food. Moreover, if I happened to be allergic to nuts, well, you can guess the worst. Anyway, keep an eye on what youre eating because if deathly allergens happen to appear on your medical chart then Plutos is tempting death! Users/blastoff

20101115 22:11:56 nbsp I dont know why there are so many rave reviews about this place. Im a salad lover and was totally thrilled to see this place that specializes in gourmet salads. I was expecting the main salad to be gargantuan according to the above reviews, but really it was a little smaller than something you would get at Red Robin. The music was too loud so the salad tosser (lol) couldnt  hear what I was saying, the lettuce tasted dirty and was full of spines (the part of lettuce that is usually removed at places that specialize in salads), and I ordered ceasar dressing but Im pretty sure what he gave me wasnt ceasar, it tasted more like a vinaigrette. The WORST part was the chicken I ordered as a topping. It was COLD little flakes of chicken, and about enough for a side salad, definitely not a meal like salad. I expect when I pay $7 for a salad, that my chicken could at least be hot. AND the side bread was disgusting, my boyfriend put it like this it tasted like someone spilled chemicals on this!. My BF ate at Habit, so I got some extra ranch to try to cover up the bad taste of my salad, and even magical ranch could not solve this travesty of a salad. McDonalds serves a much better salad than Plutos so I recommend saving a few bucks and eating there instead. The only up side to this place was the large variety of toppings, but the same could be achieved at home for much less. Users/jwieland1989

20110326 19:49:39 nbsp I love to go there for the garlic fries. They are under $3 for a plate. Deelliiiicciiouss Users/Ryu

20110727 16:36:05 nbsp Another one of a very select few quality restaurants in Davis. Great food, great service, and neither my girlfriend nor I have gotten food poisoning here! Yay! Give it a 5/5. Users/angrychair

20110816 16:46:01 nbsp The food is fairly priced and they give you big portions as well. The customer service is meh, probably because its always busy during lunch hour. I like this place and will definitely be going back.  Users/PaulV

20110920 11:35:10 nbsp I used to go here all the time as it is relatively healthy with enough variety to satisfy even picky eaters. However, one night I came in and saw two giant cockroaches on the wall behind the sandwich breads. I know the employee working there saw it and noticed I saw it too but he did nothing. While I understand that it is difficult to keep all vermin out of a restaurant, it is an image that I cannot forget and have avoided the place since. Users/jdkurushima

20111011 14:55:12 nbsp The sweet potato fries are amazing! Ive noticed the sandwiches at least though are better if you order them when its busy and a lot worse when barely anyones in there (the difference between a nice hot sandwich and a cold lukewarm one)  might be because the grill cools down and they dont wait long enough for it to heat up your food to get hot? No clue. Users/Ravyn

20120324 13:00:33 nbsp Ive been to Plutos several times now and always enjoyed their salads. Its a good deal in terms of quality and size for the price and I like being able to customize the salad with 7 different selections from their wide variety of ingredients. Their onion rings are tasty and the barbecue sauce that it comes with is amazing! Sweet, with a nice spicy kick at the end, its the perfect dip for onion rings. I tried their stuffing for the first time and its decent, although a little bland. The service is good thoughwhen I was unsure whether to have beef gravy or turkey gravy with the stuffing, the server gave me a cup of each with my order to determine which I would like more. When Im in the mood for a quick and inexpensive salad, Plutos is my goto place. Users/AlexHirsch

20120911 20:42:34 nbsp Apparently the inside is all demolished right now?  Does anyone know whats going on?  They cant be GONE, as theyre always packed whenever I go! Users/deeray82
