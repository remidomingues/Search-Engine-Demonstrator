  Po the Rat 


Po was named so because she looks like an Possums opossum. She lived with the Z twins (Users/SharonZimmerman Sharon and Users/AmyZimmerman Amy) and Users/ScottBiggart Davis Coeds Scotty. But she belonged to Amy.

Po shared a cage with Endora the Rat and missed Delores the Rat, who passed away in November of 2004.

Po was found dead on the morning of March 1, 2005. Here is Users/AmyZimmerman Amys http://www.livejournal.com/users/jegskaltisse LiveJournal entry:

My baby Po died.

Users/SharonZimmerman Sharon bought me Po because she knew id appreciate the slightly ugly/very cute little rat she saw at Ace. And I did. She was the cutest little possumrat ever, and she was mine.

I named her Po for several reasons: Her similarity to a possum was the major reason (She had thinnish curly gray hair through which you could see the pink of her skin), and the word Po means little in Italian.

Po survived Delores and is survived by Endora the Rat Endora. She was about a year and a half old.
