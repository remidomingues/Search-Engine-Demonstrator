Poetry is a division of literature. Its an ancient form that has gone through many revisions over time. Perhaps its an attempt to identify life through words, rhythms and sounds. Really, its hard to pin.

One could argue that if there was a shoe in front of a fiction writer, she might pick it up and observe it. He might also poke at it, then unlace it. Furthermore, they might look at the shoe from every angle, then write about it.

Given the same shoe, the poet might observe, poke, unlace and look at the shoe. Then they might lick it. Then rub it all over his body. Then make love to it. Then cut it into pieces with a knife. Then swallow it, letting the shoe pass through her system and defecating it into a pile on the floor. Then feeding that pile to a pigeon who would fly to a bridge leaving tiny shoe droppings en route. The poet would pick up each dropping, writing about them as if they were tiny shoes.

The definition is not so important as the poetry itself.

 Poems 
{{{Simple

by Josh Fernandez

He sits quietly
watching
as his teacher
demonstrates
the simplicity
of quadratic formulas.

The boy reaches around his own head,
gently unhooking it from his neck,
removes his left arm,
unzips himself
from his body
and calmly sets his fleshy parts,
one by one,
before him on a desk.

He moves apart his ribs,
plucks a rusted knife
from where his heart should be
and flings it
toward the open window.

The teacher:

a) puts down his chalk
b) throws his book to the floor
c) sits in his chair
d) softly begins to weep}}}

{{{Sundown, Summer, The World

by  James Lee Jobe

Look, sundown walks slowly in summer, darkness
creeps out first from the shadows of plants   a little
at a time. Shadow lengthens from under the lavender,
the rosemary, the anise. Over a sultry stretch of minutes
and hours shadow meets shadow and connects. The Mulberry
joins in this skulking carpet, low, as does the Crepe Myrtle,
the redwoods. Once darkness covers the yard, the sky
then flickers a burnt red, a glowing orange  long dashes of purple
slash the western heaven. The magpie grows quiet, then night
swims in over all this world, ebony, shimmering, soft. }}}
