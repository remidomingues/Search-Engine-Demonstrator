20130501 00:25:35 nbsp Two weeks ago, on April 18th, I attended the Poetry Night Reading Series for the first time. The Poet Laureate of Sacramento, Jeff Knorr, read some poetry from his books and also from an unpublished manuscript that he has been working on recently. It was really cool to go and hear him read, because how often do you get to hear the inflections and tone of voice in which the poem is meant to be read, by the author himself? There was ample time to meet him and have the opportunity to discuss his poetry and career at Sacramento City College. The number of people who came exceeded my expectations and showed me just how important celebrating the arts is to the residents of Davis. Attending the Poetry Night Reading Series really is an enriching cultural and artistic event which everyone who lives in Davis should experience! And the open mic after the guest poet finished reading was so fun! It gave me the opportunity to see and hear from poets and artists in our own city of Davis and appreciate their talents in an intimate setting. You never know, the guy you sit next to in class or the girl behind you in line at the Coho might be an amazing poet and you might never know unless you to go Poetry Night on the first and third Thursdays of the month!! Or maybe you are a closet poet yourself; Poetry Night is the perfect setting to hear from experienced and successful poets and respond by putting your own poetry out there. Its an awesome event, be sure not to miss it! Users/LeanneWatkins

Went to my first poetry reading last night. Since I have almost no exposure to modern poetry, I thought it would be boring  just a lot of uninspired drivel about babbling brooks, etc. I was wrong! Modern poetry here is raw, honest, and sometimes provocative. I highly recommend attending; as I left, I felt inspired and proud of these strong yet vulnerable voices in our community. Although I also appreciated the visiting poet, the real treat was the open mic portion. Users/ScottMeehleib
