Poker is a classic game dating back locally to the wild west history of California.  Playing poker (especially Texas hold em) has become more visible and popular recently, possibly due to exposure on ESPN.  While it can be played for fun with valueless chips, it is often played for cash or valued chips, either at gambling locations, peoples homes or on campus.  There are several casinos nearby, and several card rooms over the causeway in Sacramento (see gambling for a list).  You can also make the run up to Reno if you want the full neon scene.


At UC Davis, poker playing among students has become so prevalent in the dorms that at one point some freshman freshmen were heard to be losing $50100 a day in Thompson Hall in Segundo. Since then, flyers were posted mentioning the illegality of gambling, and Resident Advisors RAs were told to crack down on students playing poker for money. The poker playing hasnt stopped, though it has become more secretive: most Freshman freshmen result in going over to the Cuarto Residence Halls to play.

UC Davis Poker Tournaments

 PokerPalooza is a one day, NoLimit Hold Em tournament sponsored by Intramural sports. The most recent tournament was held on January 22nd, 2010, and saw player Jonathan Loyola win it all with Three of Kind, Aces. Prior to that, February 23rd, 2009 saw player Eitan Alfiya win it all with two pair, 6s and 9s.

 The November, 19, 2005 game at the ARC Ballroom was host to approximately 260 players, up from about 150 in 2004. Because this is a oneday tournament, play continues throughout the night until there is a winner. (The 2004 tournament extended until 3 A.M.) Unfortunately, PokerPalooza only occurs once a year. The event is free for undergraduates or $15 for everyone else. http://imsports.ucdavis.edu/pdffiles/RulesInfo05/PokerPaloozaTournament.pdf Information Sheet for 2005 http://imsports.ucdavis.edu/pdffiles/RulesInfo05/PokerPaloozaRulesF05.pdf 2005 Rules

20050126 18:34:00 nbsp Poker and other card games where the house has no bank arent illegal in the state of California.  You do need a Davis Municipal Code/8A license to collect table fees like an over18 Poker room does, however. Users/ScottRitchie

20050126 20:33:49 nbsp However, it is important to note that what is permissible on campus is not governed by simple legality, especially when it comes to the Residence Halls. If you are over 21, that doesnt allow you to consume alcohol on campus, for example. Similarly, Gambling is normally not permitted on campus University grounds. Users/ElvinLee
