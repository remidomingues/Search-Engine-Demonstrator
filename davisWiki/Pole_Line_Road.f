Pole Line Road is one of the main northsouth thoroughfares in Davis. In northeast Davis, it becomes County Road 102 and leads to Woodland. In south Davis, it terminates at Cowell Boulevard

The road has a bike lane and/or path for most of its length, except near the north Davis border. At the 5th Street intersection, there is an overpass above Interstate 80, which is the site of the Toad Tunnel.

Its also a great place to find a used car as there seems to be a constant flow of them parked on the North bound lane of Pole Line between Rancho Yolo and Lehigh Drive.  Cars, trucks, campers, you name it theyre all For Sale and priced to sell.  A virtual dumping ground with new ones each week.  I think the DPD must leave notes on the cars to tell them move every now and then so look on the South bound side if you cant find what you are looking for.

20071218 21:36:13 nbsp I live on Pole Line Road and Im often asked the origin of the name...does anyone know for sure?  Im assuming it was a simply a descriptive name for what was a utility road used to service power or communications lines (pole lines) running through Davis and Yolo County. Users/DukeMcAdow

20080718 14:55:35 nbsp anyone have experience biking in from Woodland? would this be the way to go for a relatively inexperienced rider, or would the no bikelane/low traffic county road be better? Users/LaFrance
  20080722 23:30:07 nbsp Ive biked the DavisWoodland Pole Line/Road 102 route many times, and I know someone who uses it to commute daily between Woodland and campus (Ive never asked if she has had any problems or closecalls though).  My twocents?  I prefer the wider road and bike lanes on Pole Line to any of the other narrower and lesstraveled county roads.  The greater the distance between my bike and speeding cars, the better, in my opinion.  I think more car traffic forces both drivers and cyclists to be more alert.  Theres a lot of bike traffic on Pole Line, and I think drivers expect it.  It might also make it quicker and easier to get assistance if something goes wrong. Users/DukeMcAdow
