Pole Line Road Baptist Church is one of the three Baptist Spiritual Organizations churches in Davis.

Each week a new saying inspired from the Bible is posted on the sign in front of the church on the corner of E. 8th Street and Pole Line Road. Examples: Whos your daddy? Are we to clone ourselves? Lifes not fair. Now what?

The church features a diverse congregation and is frequented by many families local to Davis. It participates in worldwide missions and community events, including a Stocking Stuffer event for the homeless in Davis in December.

The Senior Pastor at Pole Line Baptist, Exter Hardy, has been the pastor since March 1991. Exter grew up in the south and took sign language as his foreign language. He also served as a missionary to the deaf. With two deaf sons, Exter is fluent in sign langauge and thus preaches simultanously in English and sign language. Exter received his Master of Divinity and Doctorate of Ministry from http://www.ggbts.edu Golden Gate Baptist Theological Seminary. He also has a Masters Degree in Marriage and Family Counseling from California State University, Sacramento. Exter lives in Davis with his three sons (Otavio, Chase, and Joseph). His daughter, Lauren, is a junior in college in Texas.
