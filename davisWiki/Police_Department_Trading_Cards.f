20050209 22:53:03 nbsp They should give out their own card to everyone getting a ticket Users/ScottRitchie

20050209 23:00:04 nbsp If only they made DCR trading cards.  Ill trade you a Users/KenBloom for a Users/GeorgejAndrews. Users/BrentLaabs

20050224 08:06:54 nbsp i am touched Brent by your trade proposal Users/GeorgejAndrews

20061024 16:33:11 nbsp Neg, they do not Kris... I pester officers for cards as it was a well remembered thing from my youth, the most recent onces I have seen were 2005 series for dispatchers and people who work inside the station. Oh and scott, the backs of the cars have a blurb for the officers and then a place for contact info case number etc so they were designed with that in mind Users/StevenDaubert

20080421 11:27:26 nbsp These are UCD trading cards, not City cards. My guess is that they are doing so bad in the PR dept that they only have really old cards and have had such a big turnover that it would cost too much to print because most (not all) of the good  officers leave. The city isnt known for being too nice if they dont like you. Users/OurBuckle

20110203 07:20:55 nbsp Ill be down with my unwanted offspring? Or maybe Ill just ask really nicely ha ha Users/JeremyBrandonBelk
