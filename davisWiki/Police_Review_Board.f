The City Council is debating the best way to improve oversight of the Davis Police Department. The Human Relations Commission proposed an Independent Review Board, similar to the one found in Berkeley, California. The City received the HRC proposal and passed by a 50 vote the establishment of an independent ombudsman model instead and initiatives to facilitate appropriate oversight, increased responsiveness, and positive interactions between the police and the community. A citizens group, CAROLE or Community Advocating for Responsible Oversight of Law Enforcement, is still pushing for a larger review board. http://www.californiaaggie.com/media/paper981/news/2006/03/09/CityNews/Students.Protest.Decision.On.RacialProfiling.Committee1661437.shtml?norewrite200603231638&sourcedomainwww.californiaaggie.com On March 8th, 2006 150 students marched to City Hall to protest the defeat of the review board and the suggestion of the ombudsman. http://occr.ucdavis.edu/news/view.cfm?news_id174 On November 21st, 2005 UC Davis admintrators and faculty unveiled an informal http://www.policeracerelationsreport.net./ report on racial profiling, the report concluded with a suggestion that the City adopt a review board.

 Editorial: City Council offers ineffective solution 

Racial profiling in DavisBR
Posted: 3/14/06 in The California AggieBR
Though the city of Davis prides itself on being a diverse and accepting community, numerous incidents over the past few years have revealed a racial profiling problem in the town. The City Council took a step to address and alleviate the issue on Feb. 21 when it approved a police oversight committee that would look into controversial racial profiling cases. However, the councils efforts were embarrassingly flaccid.

While the council approved the examination, it significantly cut the number of members from 11 to a single paid ombudsman. The committee supporters optimistically proposed a high number of members, hoping that they and the City Council could come to a compromise. Decreasing the group to six or seven members would have been a viable option, but by cutting it to just one person, the council diminishes the severity of racial profiling.

The City Council also needs to make sure it is looking at the right issue. Mayor Pro Tempore Sue Greenwald said the formation of the committee was about helping ethnic minorities feel comfortable in Davis. The problem, however, is that city officials are condoning the illegal practice of racial profiling by not taking meaningful action.

Furthermore, the City Council must treat the issue as one that is affecting the entire city, not just students. About 150 students and some professors showed up at the last meeting to protest the large cut the council made to the proposed committee. While students have been some of the more vocal and visible victims of racial profiling, they are certainly not the only ones.

The citys goal should be to do all that it can to rectify the issue of racial profiling. But its actions regarding the new committee only show that the council is treating a shameful problem too lightly.

Alternative Models of Independent Civilian Oversight passed by Davis City Council

The Davis City Council endorsed  the following initiatives to facilitate appropriate oversight, increased responsiveness, and positive interactions between the police and the community they serve, all while maintaining the highest level of public safety for our citizens.

 1. Create ombudsman position. Develop, as part of the 2006 budget development process, the concept and funding requirements for an Ombudsman position to facilitate citizen complaints for all city programs and departments.

 2. Analyze police encounter data. Conduct a detailed analysis of police encounter data (stops and arrests) to clearly assess the potential for any disparate treatment, with a report of the results presented to the City Council in six months or less.

 3. Review citizen complaint process.  Direct the Interim City Manager to work with a Police Advisory Committee of three experts to review the existing citizen complaint process, including thoroughness of investigations and appropriateness of personnel dispositions and report to the Council in six months or less.

 4. Comprehensive oversight and advisory initiative including:
  Threeperson Police Advisory Committee to review police processes, address complaints, address investigation procedures, etc.
  Davis Police Community Advisory Board to provide input and feedback to the Police Department.  The CAB has met three times and consists of 16 individuals representing a broad cross section of the community.
  Training for officers.  This Inclusion Training will address understanding and appreciation of people with different views and belief systems.
  Accreditation for the Police Department through the Commission on Accreditation of Law Enforcement Agencies (CALEA).  This is a comprehensive voluntary national accreditation program involving professionally recognized criteria for excellence in police management and service, including community relations.
  Comprehensive Annual Report by the Police Department to the City Council

 5. Increase use of technology for public safety.  Examples include the installation of incar cameras to record interactions officers have with citizens during stops, the use of redlight cameras at major intersections in town, and a development of a new public safety radio system to improve field communication .

 6. PoliceStudent Relations SubCommittee.  This body meets on an ongoing basis to address any concerns involving interactions between the Davis Police Department, the UCD Police Department and UCD students.  The group has been working on preparations for a safe Picnic Day and other activities.

Here are the Models of the Cities of San Jose and Boise Idaho that Councilmember Stephen Souza is proposing for Davis Independent Ombudsman

http://www.sanjoseca.gov/ipa/National%20Role%20Model.html

http://www.boiseombudsman.org/


Per the Irish ombudsman model that Steve Souza cites:

 Calls for reform of the police complaints and discipline process have focused on the need for greater independence as a means to increase public confidence and police accountability. This paper addresses key reforms and draws upon empirical research to discuss the experiences of complainants. The trend among complainants indicated a perceived lack of objectivity, independence and a concern regarding the police investigating the police. The government proposal of a new independent system (IPCC) in 2000 offered a new possibility for greater police accountability.

20060330 14:53:14 nbsp As it stands right now, Ombudsman sounds smarter because its something with builtin credentials.  I think if there are problems of racism within a comunity, you run the risk of replicating those problems in a committee when you take a crosssection of that community.  The application of the law is certainly a major issue here, so I hope that any thrusts for independent oversight keep these ideas in mind.  Users/JaimeRaba

20060330 14:57:08 nbsp The Citizen Review Board would have a paid investigator with subpoena power and it would have a group of the public who would serve on the board for a two year term.  The idea size of that board would probably be 5 to 7 people.  The problem with the ombudsman is that they would still answer to the city manager and city council, and these guys have shown that they are not independent.  They completely blew the investigation of cases such as the Buzayan case and thats going to cost the city of Davis and its taxpayers quite a bit. Users/CaroleDavis

20060330 19:45:58 nbsp A police review board is not an endall solution.  It will not change residentpolice interactions overnight.  A multipronged solution will see results.  The steps outlined by the Davis PD and City Manager (above) will need time to implement and to evaluate.  The idea of an independent police review board should not be championed at the expense of thinking of new and better ways to address conflict between community residents and the police department.  If the time comes after the steps outlined by the DPD and City Manager have been tried and found unsuccessful, then we can look to more drastic solutions.  I am definitely in favor of people working collaboratively together to address issues.  In my interactions with Lt. Pytel and Sgt. Doroshov of the Davis PD in the PoliceStudent Relations SubCommittee, they have been willing to listen, discuss, and have shown much respect to committee members.

     Marsha Ludwig is the Student Services Director for the School District.  She works hand in hand with the Police Department and the Yolo County Probation Department in providing information that is ultimately used against kids in Court. Her office is used as an investigative arm of Probation Department and the Yolo County DA. She should definitely not be on the Citizens Advisory Board to the Police Department.  Again, here is an example of the fox guarding the hen house mentality that is going on.  Users/SharlaDaly

I do not trust, Hyde, Pierce, Pytel and Dorschov....Over the summer Ken Wagstaff (former Mayor), Paul Goldstene (Sac State Law Professor) and myself met with them and a few of their staff over the summer to discuss Halemas case. They told us the matter was out of their hands because the victim wanted to prosecute Halema. Well, as fate have it, the victim is my boss at the Womens Center. She never wanted the girl to be prosecuted nor was she ever contacted to endorse prosecution. The chief, the captain and his top to officers lied and the City Council supports them without question. I do not trust any solutions proposed by the police; you dont ask the fox to come up with a plan about staying away from the hen house. A police review board is not a drastic solution. It is a solution in hundreds of major US cities. What is drastic is a city council and police chief passing reforms that they came up with without any community input. An ombudsman is a true figurehead, all show and no power. Why not try the review board first then an ombudsman? What is a multipronged solution a euphemism for? It is a euphemism for a solution created by the very people the complaints are being lodged against, the police and the city manager who oversees them. And what will be deemed unsuccessful for the Ombudsman model? A larger stigma as Davis being a racist town? A real injury to a student? A highschool student being falsley put in jail as a gang member? Females living in a sorority house being raped or inured because the police took 20 minutes to an hour to respond? A student being disfigured because an officer misused a nonlethal weapon? Wait that has occurred, his name is Lucas and he has a lawsuit against the city(He spoke at city council meetng about it). How costly will it become, the Buzayan lawsuit.....the private investigation to deem Dean Johanssons complaint unfounded or the money spent trying to prosecute Deans speeding ticket which was thrown out by a judge who did not believe the officer? How much will these lawsuits cost the city, monetarily and reputationwise? As you can read on the Police Misconduct Stories page, minority students and adults have been protesting bad police practices since atleast 1989... I think its time for REAL change, not change simply to save face and recover from bad PR.Users/JamesSchwab

20060330 22:00:08 nbsp The thing is, people say give this a chancethe problem is that the people we are supposed to give a chance to, are part of the problem.  Pytel messed up the Buzayan investigation.  The city manager perpetuated that.  Bill Emlen is not a guy who is going rock the boat, that much is clear.  Jim Hyde is a problem and complicit in this.  The city council supposedly reviewed the Buzayan case, but you have to wonder exactly what that means.  Did they listen to the surveillance?  If they did, it would be hard to believe that they could arrive at the conclusions that they did.  If they did not, then thats part of the problem as well.  I have no confidence in any procedure that doesnt have eyes outside of the chain of command that can provide a check and a balance.  Basic principles of the American system. Users/CaroleDavis

20060330 22:21:20 nbsp We need more than one solution to address residentpolice conflicts.  A police review board may be able to show incidents that need Davis PD officer disciplinary action; brought forth in a public setting.  What are the other outcomes of a police review board?  I do not see a police review board fixing the stigma of Davis as racist, answering questions around constitutionality of gang validation, or improving police response time. Users/StevenWorker
   Because it will give the reality and perception that something is actually being done to solve these issues. There will be a public, transparent process for these grievances to be aired. Currently, there is no place for a citizen to go to air their grievances with any assurance their grievance will be taken seriously. The City Council, City Managaer, and Chief of Police have not shown ONE OUNCE of concern. They deny that any sort of problem exists. Those problems will be solved if an open, honest forum is created for such discussion. An ombudsman will not create an open forum. The citizens advisory committee is only composed of people who the city council feels will echo their own beliefs. And again how can we trust a solution from the very people who are creating the problem?   Users/JimSchwab

20060330 22:23:48 nbsp You are absolutely right Steven Workerwe do need more than one solution.  But that solution is new leadership from the PD to the DA.  Climate starts from leadershipthe City Manager present interim and past has no leadership.  The police chief has no leadership.  The city council and city manager are acting as advocates defending the police department as opposed to oversight.  And the DAs office is complicit by expending scarce resources on misdemeanor hit and run crimes that have been civally resolved.  That is what the problem is.  So you are correctthe civilian review board will not solve those problems.  The civilian review board will enable citizens to have a place to air their complaints that will encourage them to come for rather than berate and insult them.  Users/CaroleDavis

 http://www.davisenterprise.com/articles/2006/04/02/opinion/op_ed/273oped1.txt Council responds : with the same old tired rhetoric.  The Community Advisory Committee to date has been used as an information body that receives crime reports and other updates from the police.  They have not been used in any type of advisory capacity.  The current city manager lacks any real power or backbone.  He exerts no control over the police or police chief whatsoever.  Puntillo at a recent city council meeting suggested that the city council was the ultimate police oversight body.  That in fact could not be further from the truth as they see their first duty as defending the police rather than exercising any degree of oversight over the body.  How much control does this council and city manager have, Officer Pheng Ly, the arresting officer in the Buzayan case was named Davis Police Officer of the Year.  That is an utter slap in the face to the Buzayan family.  It is an utter and complete insult.  How much more could the Davis Police Department be further discredited.Users/CaroleDavis

    Exactly.  A kid or student who is very average, and who knows Davis well. For the student representative to have any real impact, they would have to have had some sort of interaction with the police, especially if the involvement was like.. a cop busting some teens for hanging out in a wierd location.. like the South Davis Line Spot Line Spot, or some other slightly obscure place.
