 Pancakes & Politics 

Pancakes & Politics / Politics & Pancakes (sometimes Ballots & Burritos) is about cooking and eating breakfast together, and discussing research/information about the propositions and candidates on the upcoming ballot so that we can become more informed voters. Typically pancakes are made and eaten from 10:00AM11:30AM and then the measures and candidates are discussed individually from 11:30AM to 2:30PM. Some notes are taken to record the consensus of the group. City council members have attended.

 Past events: 
Saturday, November 3, 2012 at Cornucopia Corner Coop (233 J St.)
Saturday, October 23, 2010 at Baggins End (The Domes) in the Community Yurt.

VOTERs GUIDE ZINE: /voter guide zine CLICK HERE TO SEE OUR 2010 RESEARCH & POLL!
Thank you to Danielle Fodor for creating this zine using input from this years P&P meeting crew!

WHAT IS PANCAKES & POLITICS?
It means you can find out about all the issues on the ballot in one fun meeting, and be the most informed youve ever been about the election  painlessly! It means a great chance to meet other local people who care about politics and the world were living in!  Did I mention great food??

WHY ITS GREAT:
Youll learn how to vote on all those weird little offices you never have time to research.  And, through the voters guide (Volunteers?), well be able to influence many many more voters... And its actually fun.

HOW THE PANCAKE PART WORKS:
The good people of Baggins End Baggins End Domes will have pancakes going on the grill in Dome kitchens.  Its a Pancake Potluck of sorts.  Brings your favorite pancake mix (grandmas secret recipe?), syrup, ingredient or topping.  Nuts, berries, fruits, whipped cream, exotic extras of any sort.  Keep it vegetarian, and consider the vegans and others with special dietary needs.  Juices, coffee beans and complementary sidedishes also welcome.  Come early so we can start the politics part on time!

HOW THE POLITICS PART WORKS:
Each person attending researches one (yes, just one!) ballot initiative, or candidates for one office.  They (meaning ...  perhaps....you!) will prepare a verbal 35 minute summary to share  what the arguments are on either side of the issue, or who the candidates are and what they think.  After presenting both sides, explain why youre leaning one direction and why.  Then the group of voters (and eaters) asks questions, discusses the issues, etc  ...   Issue/office List BELOW.

IF YOU ARENT going to do an issue/office but would like to VOLUNTEER, we have other things that you could do to help out with such as  timekeeping, setting up, cleaning afterward, coming early to cook pancakes etc.   If you would like to volunteer to help out, please contact:  Michelle Yates at: mailto(myates@ucdavis.edu) and/or  (530) 3041888

IF YOU ARE NOT VOLUNTEERING . . .  you are still welcome to join us and be part of the discussion!

 INFORMATION FOR PREP&P MEETING 
WHAT TO DO for YOUR OFFICE/PROPOSITION RESEARCH:
Look at both sides of the issue (or each candidate for office), discuss what the positions of the candidate are, pros and cons of props, whos for and against, what you think, and any other little juicy, gossipy tidbits we should know.  Remember, others will chime in, so you dont need to do a thesis!  You can do most offices and issues with 1/2 hour of research.  A list of several helpful websites with candidate/issue information . . . .
