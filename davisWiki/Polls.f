When editors disagree on the content of the wiki, they try to find a solution that everyone can agree to. This is called building consensus. The process can involved long discussions on talk pages. Sometimes, these discussions go on and on because one or more people simply cant compromise. Instead of arguing the issue to death, a poll can be useful to get the sense of those involved in the discussion and bring the disagreement to the end. See http://daviswiki.org/Bizarro_World/Talk?actioninfo here for an example of an edit dispute that just wouldnt end despite the near unanimous opinion from editors without a personal stake in the issue.
