The somewhat elusive Pomology Department studies the production of tree fruit and nut crops, and is the only such department in the country.  The department belongs to the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences.  It contributes to academic teaching in other related University Departments departments (like plant biology, crop science and management and biotechnology), but offers no majors major, minors minor or graduate groups graduate degree of its own.  It does, however, offer a http://caes.ucdavis.edu/intprog/eduopp/postgrcert/postgraduatecertificateinpomology postgraduate certificate in pomology through UC Davis Extension.

The department also has a reputation of giving away loads of tasty fruit and nut samples on Picnic Day.
