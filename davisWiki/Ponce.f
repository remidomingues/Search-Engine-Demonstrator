Hello! My name is Ponce, and I was born on April 30, 2006.

My namesake moved to Seattle about four years ago. This was a kitty named Ponce (named after Juan Ponce de Leon, the Spanish explorer) who my mom had taken care of for about 8 years, and was heartbroken when he had to move away. On that day, she decided that the first cat that she got, she would name Ponce. This is where I come in!

Im a domestic medium hair with grey/white patches, I weigh 11 pounds, and I go to Claremont Veterinary Hospital to make sure I stay healthy.

My favorite things to do include eating, sleeping, playing fetch, biting hair, escaping into Evas room, hiding under Kelseys bed, climbing on the freezer, wrestling, playing in the laundry basket, helping make beds, helping my mom do her homework, chasing things not visible to people, getting brushed every night before bed, playing with my BFF Chloe (the yellow lab), batting at other animals tails, playing in the bathtub (without water in it), my sparkly (and not flamboyant) collar, and giving my friends and family lots of love.
