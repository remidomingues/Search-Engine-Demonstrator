Poodles2Pugs Pet Services was run by two UC Davis Cell Biology students with a passion for pets animals. They say they are very responsible and would treat your pets as well as they treat their own.

They also realize that people are very busy and may not always have the time or energy to give their pets the attention they deserve.  They offer a wide range of pet services including dog walking, pet sitting, pet transportation, and pet waste removal poop pickup!



20120314 23:31:25 nbsp Im so happy to have found two great people to trust with my dog and home while Im away. They are professional and diligent. The email updates they provided were a great bonus. I came back after ten days to a happy and well cared for dog. Theyll be my first choice whenever I need a pet sitter. And, their rates are reasonable. Users/Sahota
