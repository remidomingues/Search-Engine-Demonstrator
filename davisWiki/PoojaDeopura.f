20100125 21:04:51 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. Thanks for creating the Davis PC Tech. Just to bring you up to speed there have been some issues with pages about local computer repair businesses and I thought Id fill you in on those. For instance see BEAR License because at least one computer repair business owner was discussing those and brought the issue up. Another item is to edit using your Importance of using your RealName real name rather than an account that matches the name of your business. The reason for this is that Davis Wiki is a Wiki Community community wiki and we are all your neighbors and people youd meet about town. See Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner for some more bits of advice. Users/JasonAller
