20100221 16:59:36 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. Have you read Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner? Users/JasonAller

20100223 19:55:19 nbsp Harvey, I looked at the http://daviswiki.org/The_Luxury_Out_House_Company?actiondiff&version216&version115 comment you left for The Luxury Out House Company. I wonder how as someone connected with Sweet Briar Books youd feel if people left similar comments on that page? Your choice of username hasnt stopped an identity forming for you in the minds of other editors based on your http://daviswiki.org/Users/Pooka?actionuserinfo edit history. This is part of the reason that I continually urge people to edit under their real names; you wont regret your words being connected to your real identity at a later date if when you choose them you do so knowing that they are attached to you. I point this out because your comment contributed to the environment in which Users/tommieW left http://daviswiki.org/Users/tommieW?actiondiff&version210&version19 this comment. Users/JasonAller

20100224 13:05:35 nbsp This is really scary I didnt leave this comment!  I had never even heard of the place until now please Wiki editors believe me that someone else maligned this business.  Has anyone ever been hacked before on here?  I have no idea who could have done this.  I will remove the comment and leave a note that states that I got hacked.  I honestly dont know how this could have happened.  Its true, anyone can see from my edits that I work at Sweet Briar Books.  I edit our page for the owner, who isnt so technically inclined with the computers.  It isnt my MO to go around attacking small businesses in our town.  Especially one that sells bath products.  I love prettysmelling soaps, so Ill have to check them out. :)  By the way, Im not a big rabbit. ;)   Users/Pooka
  Either the internet connection that you use for editing the Wiki is not secure or you left the computer that you use to edit the Wiki available to anyone because the comment came from the same IP address as the one used to make edits to the Sweet Briar Books page. Users/hankim
   As Han said, same IP address (meaning likely the same computer).  You can check right http://daviswiki.org/Users/Pooka?actionuserinfo here. Users/TomGarberson

20100224 13:30:51 nbsp Wow, thanks for clearing that up. I guess it was good I brought it to your attention. Users/JasonAller

20100224 13:31:30 nbsp Thats really creepy.  Most likely, I left myself signed in.   Users/Pooka

20100224 13:35:23 nbsp No problem.  I just found this really upsetting.  Sorry that I choose not to leave my name on here.  Im a young female, and I am wary about putting personal info out there.  Pooka is a real nickname, though.  Some of the best people in my life call me that.  :) Dont think Harvey,  think Puck.  :D Users/Pooka
  I thought the rabbit in the movie was a Pooka or Puck in English. Users/hankim

I like fairy lore, here is a nice image of a pooka (or puca).  Maybe you have your own little trickster fairy following you around hacking your wiki account!  users/DagonJones

20100224 14:37:18 nbsp Harvey was (supposedly) a pooka, but Im of the less scary variety!  Its been a long time since Ive seen the film.  Harvey was a figment of the main characters imagination, right?  I think its from a play by Mary Chase.  :)  Hey, thanks for the faerie art!  I love Brian Froud.  Thats more of the sort of pooka that I was thinking about.  If you are interested in reading some great faerie lore, the late folklorist, Katherine Briggs, collected some of the best folk tales. Users/Pooka

20100224 15:58:18 nbsp Since you are a Pooka, can you tell another Pooka to stop following me around and telling me to do things? Picture of the Pooka following me: http://img191.imageshack.us/img191/3966/500fulldonniedarkoposte.jpg Link Users/hankim

20100224 17:11:30 nbsp Oh no!  Its Frank! Users/Pooka
