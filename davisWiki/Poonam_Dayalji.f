 Official Statement 
Hello my fellow Aggies! My name is Poonam Dayalji and I am a thirdyear Political Science major with a minor in Spanish. Currently, I am the Chair of the ASUCD Ethnic and Cultural Affairs Commission and President of Delta Phi Beta, the coed South Asian Fraternity at UC Davis. I also coordinated Speak Up! 2008, a weeklong campaign to fight hate speech and homophobia at UCD. I am running for ASUCD Senate because I want to advocate for student issues and work to make students’ lives easier.

First, I want to improve Unitrans’ current shuttle service from UC Davis to the SMF Sacramento Airport. Right now, this service is Yolobus only provided during Thanksgiving break and I would like to expand it to include other major holidays. Other services do exist, but I want to implement my program so that students have more affordable choices.

Second, I will work to improve MyUCDavis so that our course webpages include links to directly email our Professors and TAs from our UC Davis email addresses. Having this option will make it easier for students to contact their teachers.

And finally, I want to work with the Entertainment Council to bring movies to the Quad during Fall and Spring so that students have something relaxing to do during their free time.

Let me make your lives as students easier by voting Poonam Dayalji #1 for ASUCD Senate. Thank you.
Best,
Poonam Dayalji
