20071115 20:20:38 nbsp David is a super nice guy, and Davis resident. Prior to repairing our clogged sewer line, he advised me to call the City of Davis Dept. of Public Works to locate the cleanout pipe in our front yard. This ended up saving us a bundle of money. The actual work he did on our house was professional and his prices were reasonable.  Users/JanieBooth

20080203 22:19:05 nbsp A good friend from Lyon Real Estate recommended Poot & Scoot to me. Dave, from Poot & Scoot stopped by to give me some advice on how to fix my sewer line after Plumbing M.D. damaged it. He went out of his way to help me out. He was very pleasant to deal with.  Users/CarolBlake

20080307 11:36:31 nbsp David is wonderful!!! I had a broken garbage disposal and he kindly helped me through it. Im telling all of my friends about Poot and Scoot. Hes kind, honest, and patient! Call him! Users/TomLee

20080307 12:23:26 nbsp Im sorry, but this may be one of the most amusing names ever for a business. Users/JabberWokky

20080320 19:39:13 nbsp David is great.  Did a great job, good prices, very helpful and knowledgeable. Users/HarrySpanglet

20080401 13:19:11 nbsp I called David after having problems trying to solder a pipe in the crawl space under my house.  The price he quoted me to come over was EXTREMELY reasonable.    Then, he asked me questions about the job and gave me all sorts of tips on how to get it done right.  He said, try them out, then call me if you still have a problem.  I did what he said, and it worked; I ended up with free advice!  He is a really nice guy, very knowledgeable and clearly very generous too.  Next job I have, I will definitely call him.   Users/JosephBiello

20080624 22:38:18 nbsp David is the best plumber in Davis.  Work is very high quality, reasonably priced and stayed within quoted value.  He even found and fixed an unnoticed leak behind the same wall that was probably the reason for termite & ant problems in that part of the house. Users/VincentFox

20080715 10:22:06 nbsp David has got to be the best plumber Ive ever come across.  We had a clogged sewer line, and he came by immediately to check things out.  He mentioned I should try to call the City of Davis Public Works, to get them to come check on their part of the line, which they would fix, if something was wrong.  The problem was fixed in an hour, for FREE by Public Works.  David told me, I hate to talk myself out of business, but I hate it even more when people arent informed abouthow things work.  Absolutely amazing.  He is the only person Ill call from here on out.  Thank You again David! Users/CarDogg13

20081008 10:26:58 nbsp Dave, this link is for you:  http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/09/us/09water.html?hp Users/JosephBiello

20081008 11:04:26 nbsp the poot and scoot truck is pretty nifty looking, I see it around town all the time Users/StevenDaubert

20081024 14:22:08 nbsp I was extremely happy with the service provided by Poot & Scoot.  David was very helpful and flexible with scheduling.  He recognized the problem right away, bought the parts, and fixed it.  I would highly recommend Poot and Scoot for plumbing services.  Very reliable and trusting company. Users/jessicakk

20081216 12:53:07 nbsp David is excellent. Twice this year (once at the place we were renting in Davis, once at our new place in Woodland) we called him and had problems fixed in less than 3 hours after our initial call. He is friendly and extremely reasonable with his pricing! Use him for any plumbing problem. Users/Adie

20090116 09:38:17 nbsp I would recommend Poot & Scoot.  I had a good experience with David taking care of a clogged toilet.  He is better than the big plumbing companies. Users/jakedavis

20090608 14:37:44 nbsp This guy is a Davis legend; came over within 10 mins of my call and figured out the problem on the spot (something that had previously eluded the city of Davis public works dept, incidentally). Look no further.    Users/drhanszarkov

20090926 00:24:26 nbsp Great experience. My sink wouldnt drain, so I looked up plumbers on Daviswiki. After reading reviews, I decided to call Poot & Scoot. David, the owner, answered and first walked me through a series of techniques to unclog the sink myself. Turns out the clog was deeper than the sink pipes, so it didnt work. But I learned a lot. He fixed it that night, in 1.5 hrs. (He charges no more than 2 hrs for sink problems.) Im a poor student, but he was flexible with payment too. Users/Devonian

20090929 17:14:10 nbsp Dave is easy to find, comes promptly if he can, and is always happy to talk you through the problem so you can fix some of it yourself, or make adjustments after he leaves.  Very good to work with.   Users/TedBuehler

20100125 11:10:05 nbsp MUST USE!
    My roommates and I just had the sort of experience that makes me feel the world can be a fair place, and honor is still important to some people. David White, owner of Poot & Scoot plumbing in Davis, CA, 5307567883, is an honest man, and he fixed our plumbing problem at a very reasonable cost. He explained everything, recommended a $10.00 tool and a $1.99 bottle of Palmolive for next time, and grew incensed that another plumber had just given us a $400.00 quote for the job he accomplished for $95.00.  Users/Leah

20100125 17:52:06 nbsp Like Leah, Dave has restored my faith in the goodness and honesty of some people. I had a clogged drain since Saturday and tried everything in the book to clear it to no avail. Dave came over, spent about an hour here, explained possible causes, and drain unclogged. Much to my surprise he only charged 1/2 hours time! If you need a plumber and want an honest and fair person, Daves your man! Users/Kiefer

20100628 20:32:26 nbsp Look no further for a plumber.  Hes a gem. Users/stephthrasher

20100628 23:01:14 nbsp Dave is a great guy, I called him for toilet questions and he did some research to find the best toilet for the price that would fit my unusually small bathroom.  He told me where to buy it so I could install it myself.  I really appreciate the helpfulness without a sales pitch.  Users/DagonJones

20100716 18:31:54 nbsp Best plumber I ever had!  Dave installed a water line for our refrigerator and did a beautiful job.  Also once came to my house to fix my faucet handle and didnt charge for it!  He is super friendly and absolutely competent. Users/EstherWright

20100924 17:24:27 nbsp After reading all the good reviews here, I decided to call Poot & Scoot. It was Sunday morning, David picked up the phone and said he would come over sometime in the evening and he would call me to confirm. Sure enough, David came over in the evening and fixed the problem we had with our dishwasher. He charged us for a half hours time. We were extremely happy with the service provided. Users/EastDavisResident

20101129 18:08:15 nbsp I called David the AM to see if he could come and fix my water heater... He asked me some pertinent questions, and told me what the issue likely was,  could come late afternoon..., and that it would take 1.25 hours to fix andplus parts, and what his rate was.  He came on time, fixed the water heater, and finished quickly, in the time he estimated!  Couldnt ask for a better experience unless it was free!  I wish!  Great plumber for small repairs! Users/Carsonsig

20101225 10:20:22 nbsp Incredible service & very reasonable price! We first tried to repair a leaking valve on the toilet, misunderstood the connection, and mangled our pipe. He fixed everything. A Davis hero!  Users/LynnEpstein

20101231 16:17:03 nbsp Highest possible recommendation. I had a water leak in my main line on Christmas Eve and based on recommendations from this Wiki, I called Dave. He managed to get over and employ some clever diagnostic techniques to help me validate where my leak was coming from. He worked with me to minimize my cost (I did a lot of the digging), and I probably wound up talking with him at least a half a dozen times, and he made probably half a dozen trips to my house to get the thing finally fixed. He let me borrow several of his tools, which were extremely timesaving. He gave me lots of tips. He was up front on all his estimates (didnt charge for the diagnostics work or all the consults) and did a real nice job on the actual pipe repair. As honest, humble, helpful, straighforward a guy as I can imagine. He doesnt do certain kinds of work (acoustics work to find underground leaks, gas lines, water heaters) but for line repairs, toilets, etc., I give Dave the highest possible recommendation. In the end, I would have been satisfied paying twice or thrice what I wound up paying him for his services (and Im picky). The stereotypical fears about fees, etc. may apply to many plumbers, but Daves service was exceptional and his cost was far below what I had steeled myself to expect. And I always like helping out a local, small biz operation... Users/PaulCrawford

20110126 11:08:19 nbsp We are lucky to have someone like David living here in Davis.

My experience: Our house had a backed up drain. After spending hours snaking it myself to no avail, I called David Smith. Even though he was busy, he talked to me over the phone about the problem in detail to see if there was some way I could fix it myself. He then told me that he was too busy to come over, but recommended another plumber else who could do it. When that plumber could not resolve the problem, he came over at 6PM that night to fix the problem. (He called us to tell us that he felt bad that the other guy couldnt do it.)

He told us it would probably take two hours, but the problems was a real bear, and it took him almost four hours of snaking through various cleanouts before he finally found the clog and got it out. He charged us only for 2 hours. He even included the replacement of the kitchen drain trap at no charge.

This was definitely service well above and beyond the call. I had used him once before for a much more routine problem, and also had a great experience with him.

David is also an incredibly nice man. I will definitely call him for any other plumbing issues I have. Users/MarkusLuty

20110301 20:16:10 nbsp You cant do any better than Dave.  His prices are reasonable, he did an excellent and thorough job, and most importantly, he is a true professional who takes pride in his work  even for a relatively small job.  Plus, hes got the best business name of all the plumbers.   Users/CovertProfessor

20110301 21:32:15 nbsp Dave was great. He replaced our kitchen sink, installed new faucet and garbage disposal for 1/3 the cost of another plumbing company in Davis. He was straightforward with the costs, and was stunned with the itemized receipt the other company wanted to charge me. He explained how to maintain everything, and was very easy to talk to. Its nice to be able to find a trustworthy person who gets the job done right and at a fair cost. Users/AMoore

20110328 18:05:11 nbsp David is as honest & straightfoward a guy as they come. I call Poot & Scoot when in need of a plumber because David is skilled as a plumber, his prices are reasonable, and hes very trustworthy...he gets my highest recommendation! Users/RickHolmes

20110526 22:28:41 nbsp I called David today at 4:30 and left him a voicemail; at 8pm he had me, the happy customer, gladly handing him a check for my fixed toilet. When he called me back and left me a voicemail, he first suggested that if I was having a problem with any other drains in the house that I should call Public Works and they would fix it for me for free. He left me detailed directions and provided me with the phone numbers, too! But, since that wasnt the case, he came right out, spent about 2 hours at my place (exactly as he had quoted), and pulled a tree root out of my drain pipe! Now it flushes beautifully. As he was wrapping up, he mentioned to us that the city of Davis is offering rebates on lowflow toilets and recommended some good models that he had seen at a good price in case we were interested. All in all, I was really impressed with his timeliness, honesty and eagerness to keep us informed. Users/StephanieStudebaker

20110601 12:24:19 nbsp David is awesome. I called to see if he could come fix an issue I was having with my sink faucet. Rather than take my money, he guided me through the repair over the phone! I cant imagine calling any other plumber. Users/DanLawyer

20110805 16:32:30 nbsp As others have observed, David is great.  Hes the third plumber weve used, and hell be our goto guy now.  He fixed two complicated leaky faucets that required ordering parts.  He actually ordered extra parts and showed me how to fix it myself in case the other faucet started leaking.  Compared to the constant upsell of other plumbers and inconsistent service, David is honest, friendly and local. Users/ScottLay

20110905 17:01:26 nbsp I searched online for a plumber in Davis and I read all these wonderful five stars reviews about David on Daviswiki and Yelp.com.  So I left David a message on Sunday night around 10pm.  Then David returned my call 8am on Monday (labor day)morning.  He brought all the parts and fixed our problem in the afternoon.  Hes really as nice and honest as the reviews said.  I really appreciate him for coming out even on a holiday.  He only charged us the labor.  We paid for the parts but he didnt charge extra for the parts which he brought from the store.  I will definitely recommend him to all my friends. Users/AmyC

20110914 11:09:20 nbsp Dave was wonderful!!!  Came the same day (within 2 hrs) to examine our leaking shower faucet, figured out the part that was needed, gave an estimate, went to Roseville to pick up the part, came back first thing the next morning and repaired it very quickly.  Wonderful plumber, and will be using him again! Users/ChristineHaas

20110916 08:56:15 nbsp David is as great as all the reviews say he is. I called him midday on Wednesday and he came at 6pm that evening to work on our leaky toilet. He didnt want us to have to take time off of work, and was more than willing to come after hours. Even though he spent extra time with us talking about the toilet and giving us tips (and just chatting! such a nice fellow!) he roundeddown on the time he spent working when he wroteup the bill. Hes very honest and good at what he does. Users/EmiliaC

20111011 10:53:14 nbsp Highly recommended.  Called David at 6PM about a clogged drain, and he arrived 15 minutes later.  Worked for nearly 4 hours on a difficult problem, did a great job and charged exactly the price he quoted over the phone despite the problems that cropped up during repair.   Users/SteveNoctor

20111011 14:16:02 nbsp David came out to fix the clogged bathtub  we tried fixing it ourselves but the clog was really deep down and we didnt have the equipment to go that far  I assumed Id have to pay for the full hour but he only charged me for the half hour it took for him to fix it! That was a nice surprise! Users/Ravyn

20111023 18:40:05 nbsp Another satisfied customer. David did a great job fixing a challenging leak. His work was high quality. His rate was reasonable. And he completed the work on the weekend. He’s a true professional. Highly recommended! Users/AngeloDeSantis

20111130 09:36:17 nbsp I completely agree with the positive reviews of Poot & Scoot, and the generally negative reviews of Plumbing M.D. on the wiki.

When my drain was blocked my wife pulled Plumbing MDs number out of a hat. They responded quickly, however they claimed they ran 100 feet of drain snake and did not encounter the blockage.  They charged us $125 for an hour of work without any noticeable effect, then tried to sell my wife on a $400 service plan whereby we would receive a %10 discount on future work done and get priority service.  In other words, in the future it would be easier and faster for me to pay them to not accomplish anything for a reasonable $400.  They also tried to sell a $300 video inspection of our pipes  however I understand from other plumbers that when the drain is blocked you are unlikely to see anything on the camera.  It definitely felt like they were trying to squeeze us for as much money as they could.

In contrast, once we took the time to ask friends and read some reviews about Poot and Scoot, we wish we had called him in the first place.  Dave lived up to the accolades by responding cheerfully on a Saturday morning, letting himself in as I was at work, clearing the blockage in the drain (which was only 70 feet in  unknown why Plumming MD couldnt fix it with 100 feet of snake), and leaving a clean work area and a reasonable bill on the step on his way out.

Also in stark contrast with Pumming MD: Dave will not charge if he cant fix your problem, and guarantees his work for 6 months (he will come back out at no cost if the drain gets plugged again). This shows his confidence in his own ability (he says he has only been stumped by a drain twice in 6 years), and IMHO is all you need to know when selecting a new plumber.

Please support excellent business practices and local small business and pick Poot & Scoot as your next plumber.  Users/jamesrbronson

20111212 18:54:27 nbsp We decided to go with Poot & Scoot because of the rave reviews on the Wiki, and we were not disappointed! David started by suggesting we contact the city, as the problem might be theirs  allowing us to fix the problem with no cost at all. Unfortunately, that was not the problem. He then came out the very next day — apologizing he could not make it out at 8pm that very (Sunday) night, fixed the problem at an extremely affordable and surprisingly low cost. He then gave detailed instructions on how to install a new pipe ourselves so we would not have to pay for any additional work — basically giving free advice. For any plumbing needs we ever have again, we will absolutely be calling Poot & Scoot!  Users/HeatherMcKibben

20120110 15:39:58 nbsp Excellent, prompt service; normal industry rates. As noted above, he first recommended having the city do a sewer line check on their side. They did; it wasnt their problem, so he was out within the hour. Explained the work in detail, gave an itemized bill, and discussed future issues. Highly recommended.  Users/DonShor

20120110 15:43:17 nbsp Every time I see the Poot & Scoot vehicle around town I laugh.  In a good way!  I havent needed a plumber in Davis, but if I do I know who Ill call.  Talk about a memorable name. Users/TomGarberson
 I spoke with David over the phone once at like 2 AM, he was super chill ! Daubert

20120129 11:02:41 nbsp The garbage disposal stopped working this morning (motor humming but no action) and despite finding instructions online on how to fix the problem I was still a bit too timid to follow the instructions since Im just a lowly tenant. I called Poot and Scoot (on a Sunday morning mind you) and within 10 minutes David called me back and walked me through how to fix the problem myself (free for me, but took up Davids time). Ten thumbs up!  Users/StellaCopeland

20120830 14:41:40 nbsp I cannot speak highly enough of Dave! Weve used him several times to help us out! We have old pipes and roots that interfere with our cleanout and he always knows exactly how to fix it. He only ever charges us for an hour and a half when sometimes he is working on our clogs for over 2 hours! He is friendly and generous and I will never use another plumber! Use Poot and Scoot!! Users/AllisonOlson

20121122 09:37:08 nbsp   Exemplary local business.  Called with a drain problem.  Rather than make a weekend/holiday high dollar trip to take care of it, he gave me instructions on how I might be able to do the work myself.  I was.  Thanks to Poot & Scoot and to Davis Wiki for putting me on to him. Users/ButchySchwank

20130107 10:08:02 nbsp We found David to be very helpful, fair, and honest. I think he gave us a free quote, didnt charge us for a cheap part that he had on hand, etc. However, after fixing our problem with our shower, he left us with a big hole in our bathroom wall because he said he didnt do sheetrock repair, and left us to find someone to fix that. That was very frustrating. I also just called him to see if he could install a new hot water heater for me, and he said that he doesnt do that. So it seems like hes great at what he does, but what he does is somewhat limited, so if I were to hire him again Id want to be sure that he would be able to complete the job or would take care of outsourcing the stuff he cant do. Users/harvardslacker

20130311 12:26:41 nbsp Great service for a fair price.  Called him this morning, we made an appointment for a few hours later, he arrived on time and fixed my sad kitchen drain quickly and without a mess.  Charged me for only 40 minutes of time total and gave me some tips to avoid clogs in the future. Users/SarahmDavis

20130423 14:17:59 nbsp We have enjoyed Davids service on multiple occasions.  Davis is very polite and always willing to help.  He is very honest about what he can do and what he cannot.  For the jobs that he was willing to take on, he was great in terms of quality of work and fees charged.  Yesterday we had a water hammer issue in the house and called him in the evening.  He offered some suggestions over the phone and, after knowing that we were not able to perform certain tasks, came over (after 8pm) and helped us resolve the issue.  Afterwards he did not want to take any payment for his help.  After my insistence, he asked for 20 dollars.  We are really impressed by his kindness and character.   Users/LW

20140410 11:36:38 nbsp I saw David last year and he cleaned my sewage blockage so that it worked again when we flushed the toilets. I was satisfied, but he thought the problem was only a temporary fix so he said No charge even though he spent an hour and a half on it. I wrote a check anyway and had to keep offering it to him before he finally accepted it. I rarely run into people with such strong morals and superior work ethics. Users/ChrisOkusako

20140416 22:41:46 nbsp We had an after hours emergency and called David.  He got back to us fairly quickly and once we explained the problem, he advised us to call the Department of Public Works.  Turns out, it was a city problem….not a problem with our home plumbing, so we didnt have to pay for it.  He saved us from having to pay for an after hours visit which was an honest thing to do.  The best part was that he assured us that if the Department of Public Works didnt fix the problem, he would come out and fix it even though it was after 8pm.  We would call him again without a doubt!   Users/darcid4

20140613 15:30:57 nbsp The Best, period. Dave came out late evening to fix a problem I couldnt, and had it solved in 1/2 hour. He was only going to charge $45 or so but I gave him all the cash I had on hand ($60$70) and I would have paid double what he asked for if I had it.  Users/RalphFinch
