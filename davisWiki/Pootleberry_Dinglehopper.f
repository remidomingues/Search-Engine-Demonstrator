Wanna snuggle my Molly kitten
Sweet little kisses I am smitten
And when her motor begins to purr
I just wanna cuddle with her

I call her Mollypop, Mollypop, oh mollymollymolly
Mollypop, Mollypop, oh mollymollymolly
Mollypop, Mollypop, oh mollymollymolly
Mollypop

Sweeter than a freshly packed bowl
Love her right down to my soul
Users/MichaelGiardina Youd love her Â‘til the end of time
But Mollypop is mine
I call her Mollypop, Mollypop, oh mollymollymolly
Mollypop, Mollypop, oh mollymollymolly
Mollypop, Mollypop, oh mollymollymolly
Mollypop

Grey kitten wearing little white gloves
She is the one that I loves
Cutest cat ever, thats what I think
My Mollypop is the stink

I call her Mollypop, Mollypop, oh mollymollymolly
Mollypop, Mollypop, oh mollymollymolly
Mollypop, Mollypop, oh mollymollymolly
