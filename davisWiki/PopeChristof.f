Yeah, thats me. a while back. in theory, there are newer photos of me somewhere.

I am a full time bladesmith, possibly the only one in Davis.

Im old for Davis. Actually, that is not true. I am old for my nonhomeowner, really truly liberal, non SUV driving, non Volvo driving, independent segment of Davis. Seems like Davis is either all pre28s or post 45s or die soft yuppies.

Im married to Users/JessicaLuedtke Jessica and we have two children Leif and Astrid.

I am often known by several other names and will readily answer to shouted cries of K, koyote, and Da.

Im partial to:

  hapkido
  organic veggies
  real PostScarcity Liberalism, the technological kind
  cooking. Real cooking. Ive been doing it creatively or professionally for 18 years (part time)
  http://angband.oook.cz/ angband
  home brewing
  bladesmithing
  lots of other stuff
