The primary dance style in the club is popping (a particular form of dancing). Popping also refers to a number of illusionary substyles, including (but not limited to): waving, strutting, ticking, boogaloo, tutting, animation, and strobbing.

At Popping Club, members develop their own personal freestyle dance personalities, foundation, and technique through various activities. Members may also learn choreography and sets, which can be vital with the learning process of developing personal dance styles.

The club strives to create a welcoming and supportive community; the diversity of the club (in terms of background and dance style) allows everyone to contribute, whether it’s teaching a newer member how to wave, or recording videos so members can see their improvement through the years.

In addition to a strong community, the club emphasizes the importance of popping/funk style culture. Members can be exposed to the dance community outside of Davis by going to jams (battles); it is an amazing experience anyone can benefit from, as well as a means to inspire people to improve.
