Hi!  Im Jaymes.
I have the Aisu Pop popsicle stand at the Farmers Market (feel free to come by and say hi, even if you dont want a pop).
Ive lived in Davis since 2002.  I consider Orlando, FL my hometown and Baton Rouge, LA is where I had an amazing childhood.
I love the Davis Wiki and figured its about time I did some contributing too.  So heres my start!

20080131 22:23:52 nbsp Jaymes makes more than popsicles, although Aisu Pop is locally famous for good reason. I expect shell let the Wiki world know when shes got another public gig, and if you ever have a chance to eat other foods shes made, I recommend you take it! Users/DougWalter

20080901 21:00:48 nbsp Okay, of course, we all love Jaymess popsicles and breakfast sandwiches at Farmers Market.  However, this weekend Kara and I were delighted to have her cater a brunch for 40 people at our house.  And, everything was marvelous and an absolute joy to us, and our friends and family from around the country that joined us.  Thank you Jaymes! Users/ScottLay

20100120 16:58:58 nbsp Hi
I saw the article featuring you in the Sac News & Review today. Sounds like good work that you are doing in Davis. Although, I havent been over that way to try a pop or sandwich as of yet, it comes highly recommended. It was a funny thing this past Thanksgiving when I drove down two passengers (1 UCDavis student & 1 S.F. Bay traveler (off of Craigslist))to L.A.and a big part of our conversation was of a woman named Jaymes with the yummy popsicles. Just wanted to let you know that you have a very good reputation going.

All the Best
