 Pornography In The Dorms 

Pornography is particularly annoying when everyone in the dorms simultaneously realizes that cybernudies are available at 10mb/s.  When spring fever hits, its possible one giddy person will hog up all the bandwidth and affect everyone else. Its truly disturbing to sneak into a roommates room and see the weird fudge hes downloading. Wild. Taking a picture of his screen with a digicam provides good laughs and possible blackmailing later on! For more nakedness, see: Sex.


 Production 

Understandably, production is kept fairly quiet.  Any local noted pornographers, feel free to add yourselves.

  In 2004 http://suicidegirls.com SuicideGirls featured a photo of a young woman on Stevenson Bridge.  Her name on the site was http://suicidegirls.com/girls/Absinthe/ Absinthe.  She was a Davis native, attending Davis High School and graduating in 2004.
   This has been bothering me for a long time.  I knew the girl in question and I saw the pictures on SuicideGirls.  The pictures were not porn, they were erotica.  Theres a pretty big difference.  She was/is a good kid and should not have to bear the accusation of being a porn model for doing something a little wild in her youth.
   Welcome to Davis, I recognize Absinthe.... I told her she could do modeling in like Jr. High. I also know of several mature Davisites and another 04 alumni who became active in the porn industry. Good times Users/StevenDaubert

  Davis professor Darrell Hamamoto created a 50minute pornographic film entitled Skin on Skin and a shorter film, Yellowcaust: A Patriot Act, consisting of clips from the first. They mix intensely sexually explicit scenes with a deep message, mainly... a juxtaposition of the subjugation of Asians against graphic sex. There is a documentary about Skin on Skin titled http://www.mastersofthepillow.com Masters of the Pillow. It was featured on a segment of The Daily Show and is available to watch http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/wednovember192003/theysohorny here.

  In 2011, genderqueer porn star http://jizlee.com Jiz Lee gave a talk on campus for GASCs Generation Sex Week. They spoke on their involvement with the queer porn movement in San Francisco, visibility for marginalized communities in porn including queer community queer women and trans people of color, ethical pornography, and porn as art and activism.

  In 2011 A former student of UC Davis appeared at the Moonlite Bunny Ranch, a legal brothel in Nevada turn reality show. Dani James appeared in a soft core porn directed and produced by the same staff as their long time running HBO series Cathouse. Dani starred with a fellow nameless UCD student in the soft core porn style light bondage scene. (http://www.bunnyranch.com/showgal.php?gcontent/BR/Bunnies/danijames/1393/2_1&s27 link)



In Peets (downtown) the other day, I saw some weird guy peddling porn...just something randomUsers/ArianeMetz

Hrmm I dont like the implication that porn is worse than erotica or that a good person wouldnt be associated with porn... (see note about SuicideGirls). Its fine if people wanna differentiate between erotica and porn, but not if were making value judgements about porn/erotica and the people involved in them.  Users/JenniferGiang
