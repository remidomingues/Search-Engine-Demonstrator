20050827 20:37:13 nbsp Portage Bay is highly recommended by almost everyone that has lived there.  I think it won complex of the year in 2001...  The management is very friendly, capable, and reasonable.  If you dont like animals, this place is not for you, as the complex becomes a freeroaming cat colony at night.  Instaconnect sucks, dont decide based on that alone! Users/NicholasKentBasham

               2006116 15:24:10 nbsp I would like to retract my statements on Instaconnect, I was a little too opinionated at the time that I wrote that review.  I loved the complex, but I did have poor luck with Instaconnect  the signal was too weak to be consistently connected.  This may have changed since my stay at Portage Bay.  Ryan, my apologies ><  Users/NicholasKentBasham


20050830 14:20:34 nbsp Nicholas, why do you say Instaconnect sucks? I work for Aria Communications, we provide Instaconnect. I looked through our tech support call logs, and see nothing from you, nor do I see you registered. Are you speaking from personal experiance, or did you just hear about problems from a friend? Users/RyanCastellucci

20060221 16:24:45 nbsp I lived at Portage Bay for about a year and half and the manager was always nice to me.  Any maintainance problems we had got fixed quickly.  I loved the big patio, it was very private, high walls with ivy all over them.  They have been redoing some of the fences for the lower patios and the structure of the upper patios.  My only complain is that our apartment didnt get much light, there was only 4 windows counting the sliding glass door, but if you get a unit on the end of a building they have more windows.  They have a great spa and well maintained pool.  There is good lighting in most spots except for one of the corners of the parking lot.  The landscaping is very nice too, always have gardeners out working.  There is plenty of parking, but lots of trees so your car can get kind of dirty in some spots.  I would recommend this complex to anyone who asked. Users/LaurelManfredi

20070106 18:12:55 nbsp I went to see an 2bd/1ba apartment there today. I love the big patio area. I heard the swimming pool is rarely crowded. One thing that really didnt like was the fact that you have to renew your 1 year contract every year. I understand the first 1 year contract because the manager would want less turnover on their property. But the fact that I have to make 1 year commitment every year seems excessive. Is this kind of lease term normal in Davis? Users/YooSook

20070122 16:47:14 nbsp Yes, most leases are year leases... there are complexes that have sixmonth leases, and some lowincome complexes have monthtomonth leases, but the majority are 12 month leases. It can be frustrating...  Users/ElleWeber

20070131 19:32:06 nbsp I absolutely LOVE living here!  The management is extremely nice, and repairs are always done quickly!  The landscape and pool area are beautiful, theres plenty of parking, and it is a pretty quiet place.  The only thing I dont like are the gardeners who come around 9 am every wednesday morning or so with their loud leafblowers ... but I understand they have to do their jobs.  I also LOVE my sundeck/patio.  And yes, the pool is rarely crowded. Users/MindyYang

20070228 11:52:18 nbsp I have lived at Portage Bay for 3+ years.  Jackie, the apartment manager, is the best.  We appreciate the personal touch she adds with Christmas cards, bbqs, pizza parties, and coffee days.  Users/RobertPattison

20070331 08:21:15 nbsp Which is better? Top floor one bedroom or ground floor one bedroom? I imagine the top floor is sunnier and the ground floor has a bigger patio. Users/BreeGee

20070604 23:09:09 nbsp i like the top floor.  LOVE the sun, the garden bin, and the balcony! Users/MindyYang

20070618 10:15:37 nbsp I know that chances are slim, but would anyone be interested in displaying pictures of their Portage Bay apartment interiors? Im interested to see what the apartments look like :) The images that I could find on the PB web site are few, and all exteriors. Users/FredBarrett

20070816 14:26:36 nbsp Best secret in Davis. Overall the complex is quite and very clean. The one bedrooms are awesome because your typically on the end so there is only 1 wall to share. I personally live on the first floor and I love it. There is a small yard where you can grow plant if you have a green thumb. My unit has its own outdoor hose which is awesome. The layout is nice however the cabinets are old and I cannot stand the closet doors. Any repairs that need to get done are taken care of right away. I had instaconnect my first year here and it was okay it went out about 4 times which was annoying and inconvient but otherwise not a big thing. The laudry room is awesome since it is coinless only bad thing is people can lag getting there laundry out of the washer or drier which can cause issues.  Users/Donna

20070828 13:16:55 nbsp Best place I have ever lived. Management is nice and responsive. The layout of my apartment is really nice too. The only complaints I have are about some of the tenants, but nothing unexpected for an apt complex (people being noisy when walking through or shouting in the parking lot at 1am). The grounds are very pretty and well kept. There are recycling bins next to every set of dumpsters... although during moving day people are tossing EVERYTHING including recycle stuff into the dumpsters (or rather on top of the lids). Again, things that cant be helped in a college town apartment. The place is very well lit and I always feel safe. Rent is decent. My friends are often jealous of this complex.  Users/PhedreC

20071215 14:41:11 nbsp I lived at Portage Bay for 3 years in a 2 bedroom. I only moved out 2 years ago because my roommate graduated. Jackie is the best manager I have ever met, she is extremely helpful and understanding. Maintenance is quick to respond and also very friendly. LOVE the BBQ and I even got a birthday card from management!!  Users/JessicaYang

20080104 11:58:34 nbsp I love living here! I dont plan on moving until I have to leave Davis. The only thing that could make this place even more awesome is if there were a grocery store a block away. ;) but thats not the managments problem. Users/AishaJohnk

20080112 16:32:54 nbsp This place isnt exactly near the most important parts of Davis, but a three bedroom townhouse here is almost 500 dollars cheaper than at the Lexington.  My bother lived here and he was satisfied with it. Users/AndrewHarrison

20090123 18:00:37 nbsp Ive lived here since September and have been very satisfied. The management is very attentive and responds quickly to any concerns. Theyre also really nice. The grounds/facilities are well maintained. Most of the people who live here are grad students and working professionals (I believe the manager told me thats 75% of the residents) so there havent been any problems with noise or anything like that. The apartments are very affordable. One downside is the apartment interiors look somewhat dated. Also, theres not much room to entertain  the living space is kind of small (though the bedrooms are a good size). If those two things dont bother you too much, this is a great, affordable place to live with good management  something youll be hard pressed to find in Davis! Users/OscarSabino

20090210 23:27:56 nbsp Anybody here need a roommate for 20092010? Yea? Users/ChristyMarsden

20090408 22:47:32 nbsp Hi everyone  Im moving to Davis this fall as a grad student and looking for a good place in Davis to live.  An old coworker of mine lived here and said good things.  Anyone still looking for a roommate? Users/klanim

20090915 14:45:18 nbsp This is my second year living here, and I am very satisfied for the most part.

If you are considering living here, there are a few things you might want to know... The complex is VERY quiet (even on weekends), so if you like to throw parties, play loud music, or entertain more than a couple people, this is not the place for you. Your neighbors will not hesitate to complain to the management or the police if you bother them. If youre looking for a place to study or raise a family, this is it.

As for maintenance, my opinion is mixed. For short, simple repairs, they will come in and fix it right away. Sometimes the paperwork gets lost in the office, so you might need to remind them. For big things (since I have lived here, this includes a broken toilet, door that wont shut/lock, and dry rot), maintenance tends to find quick fixes that dont really work in the long run. They had to come in to repair our brand new toilet several times because the guy didnt do it right the first time. As far as the door, were still waiting for someone to fix it...

Finally, the management is awesome. If you complain about anything to Jackie in person, she solves the problem right away. She is always available to talk and she is really friendly.

Overall, I would recommend living here. Just make sure you document any damage before you move in, and complain about any problems as soon as they crop up.  Users/StephanieRobinson

20091007 14:16:48 nbsp As an update on the maintenance, they have now hired a new maintenance supervisor named Sal. He seems very experienced and he knows what he is doing. The last guy took over a month to get around to our broken door without even fixing it, and Sal fixed it within 15 minutes.  Users/StephanieRobinson

20091113 17:06:40 nbsp I have lived at Portage Bay Apartments since midMay and love everything about it.  Weve had very little issues with noise or trouble, and they are shut down pretty quickly.  We do have a new maintenance supervisor, Sal, and he is amazing.  Our Manager Jacque is very nice and attentive, if you need something taken care of, it generally gets done as soon as we have the opportunity to take care of it.  As a resident, I love how quiet it is and that it is catfriendly.  As an employee, I love the staff.  If you have any questions, please dont hesitate!  Call or email us at the complex and well be happy to speak with you! Users/ReeseLayton

20100605 12:56:43 nbsp I am very sad to be leaving my one bedroom apartment here at Portage Bay. The atmosphere here is very peaceful and quiet, and I love that my apartment overlooks the pool on one side, and a nice little flower garden from my balcony. This is the perfect place for a grad student, (or serious undergrad) or for someone with a small family. Not a party complex at all. There is never any noise after 10pm, which is amazing when youre trying to study, or get a good nights sleep.
The complex is very kid friendly and if youre lucky like me you will have wonderful, friendly neighbors. The management is very helpful and understanding, and they always have a nice little bowl of candy in case youre in need of a little sugar when you get off the bus. Speaking of which, I love that there are two bus stops right outside the apartmentmade getting to school in the mornings very easy and convenient. The head maintenance man, (Sal) is very nice and in my experience he has always managed to fix whatever problem the same day. The apartments are a little older, but you can tell that the management and maintenance try to keep them maintained and replace things. I LOVE my little patio, and until recently (been SOOO busy) I have had a wonderful time managing my little patio garden. Its bright and sunny and just a nice place to relax outside and get some sun. I wish I could have had a washer and dryer in my apartment (probably my only complaint) but there are a couple laundry facilities on the property that use a card system. In my experience, there has always been open machines to use during different times of the day. Theres a nice little pool and spa on sight that never looks very crowded if you enjoy swimming. Overall I think this is probably one of the best apartment complexes in Davis. No roaches, no rodents, and an overall great location.    Users/chmorr

20101204 11:38:19 nbsp We lived in a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom townhouse at Portage Bay for 3 years. We only moved out because we needed more space, and we were very sad to leave. Jacque, the manager, is wonderful. Shes very friendly, incredibly responsive to any concerns her residents have, and knows everyone personally. The maintenance guy, Sal, is also fantastic. He knows how to fix pretty much everything, and he can do it fast.

The individual apartments are old, but theyve been well maintained. We were lucky enough to have a washer and dryer in our apartment, but there was also a laundry facility just steps from our front door. The little patio/garden area was big enough for us to have a large gas grill, store our bikes, and grow lots of herbs and vegetables. It would have been nice to have a little more light in the apartment, but we survived.

I would highly recommend living at Portage Bay to any grad student, postdoc, or young family. The location is nice and out of the way, and the complex is quiet and friendly. The fact that there is now a grocery store a block away (The IGA market) just makes everything that much better. Its a great place to live, and we would move back there in a heartbeat if circumstances allowed. Users/AdeleSeelke

20110328 09:39:43 nbsp One of the best apartment complexes I have ever lived in. This was one of the first times in recent memory that my fiancee and I had absolutely no hesitation in renewing our lease. Our rent did not increase with renewal (it was not even some sort of special if you renew early as I have experienced with other apartment complexes). Jacque and the other management staff are awesome.

The management recently had dual pane windows installed in our unit (I am pretty sure they are working their way around the complex) and they make a stunning difference. The apartment stays the temperature we want it to with minimal energy expenditure and the noise from Lake (we live on the side that faces Lake) is significantly diminished.

We live in a 2 bedroom townhouse, so we have washer and dryer hookups inside, but when we did not have washer/dryer inside the complex has great facilities and I never had a problem finding a open washers/dryers.

Sal is great to have around on maintenance. I know Sal from Eastlake Apartments and he was efficient there and is great here. He couldnt stand Stonesfair Management Stonesfair managed properties and neither could I.

I would recommend Portage Bay Apartments to anybody (except my enemies, as I dont want them living here).  Users/JamesKrause

20110616 13:53:37 nbsp I recently left Portage Bay  which was the first apartment complex I have ever lived in.  The management is fantastic, and Im already missing our maintenance supervisor Sal at my new place in Antelope.  Personally, I think my apartment experience has been ruined by Portage Bay because no one will be quite as awesome as everyone here.  I would highly recommend Portage Bay to anyone who likes a quiet atmosphere, friendly people and a staff that really cares. Users/ReeseLayton

20110923 10:23:00 nbsp I moved to Portage Bay at the beginning of September 2011.  Its been almost a month of living here, and Im not exaggerating when I say its like living in paradise.  Jackie McKee, rental manager, is very, very welcoming, and Sal and Josh keep the grounds looking very beautiful and exceptionally well maintained.  The pool and hot tub are always clean.  Ive been very surprised at how quiet this complex is.  There are many young families, grad students, and professors and retired folks.  Ive never heard any loud noises, day or night in this complex, although the weekend evening racket from Arlington Farms complex is sometimes definitely loud.  There are so many trees here, its like living in a treehouse, and the proximity to Russell Boulevard bike path is wonderful. We are right on the bus route also.  This is by far one of the most beautiful and enjoyable apartments Ive ever lived in.  Thank you, Jackie, Sal, and Josh! Users/DeborahLattimore

20120112 12:58:52 nbsp My boyfriend and I moved into Portage Bay in June 2011. We signed a lease without seeing the place (as we were moving across from Europe) and based our decision solely on the reviews that we found online. We are so happy that we ended up here. It is quiet and nice, the rooms are spacious and we have everything we need. Jackie (the manager) and Sal (maintenance) are always friendly and helpful which makes a massive difference. We had a few things breaking just after moving in and it was dealt with instantly. It didnt take us very long to decide that were going to stay in Portage Bay Apartments for however long were in Davis for.  Users/DrS


20120729 14:02:16 nbsp I lived at Portage Bay Apartments for one year. I wish I could have stayed longer but I needed more space and there are only three 3bedroom townhouses (although there are more 3bedroom flats), otherwise I would have stayed for as long as I could. Jacque (the manager) and Sal (maintenance) are fantastic. I was frequently asking them for help (Sal jumpstarted my car for me once when I was in a tough spot!) and they were always so responsive, even though I probably drove them crazy! My unit was used as a model, so I got $100.00 off my rent for about 4.5 months while I was there even. When I had to move out and I needed to adjust my movedate, Jacque helped me make the arrangements. Then, when my new lease fell through, Jacque helped me found a new place immediately! While I was there they were always quick (same day) to make repairs, and they really want to keep the place nice. Recently some very inconsiderate person(s) decided to start stealing the soap and paper towels and toilet paper out of the pool house, and this is the first real problem they have had in years with theft. Obviously some people like to take advantage of trusting souls who are working hard to provide a nice, accommodating, and high quality living environment. The pool and spa are maintained everyday during the week, and the landscaping guys come every Wednesday (so plan your naps accordingly) and keep the grounds looking beautiful. Even the laundry room is wellmaintained, and there is never a problem finding parking in the lot. Cats are welcomed (with current vaccinations and keep them fixed please!) and even encouraged. There are some very friendly cats who will happily welcome every visitor as you walk through the complex, but there are really never issues with cat poo on the lawn or anywhere else, despite the number of cats roaming around. I have heard some people had issues with fleas in the apartment (which management took care of immediately), so please keep the place nice and use flea collars/powder/etc if you are going to let your felines outside. The complex is generally very quiet (although you will hear your neighbors when they walk up and down the stairs if they are heavy walkers), and the pool usually only gets crowded in the late afternoons when families bring their kids out to the pool. I like to go in the early afternoon or later at night (pool closes at 10 so the complex is super quiet at night) and it is very relaxing. There are a LOT of families here with children, so if you dont like kids dont come here. It was great for us because we have an eightyear old and she had so many friends to play with, and the kids really enjoy playing on the lawn and in the bushes with the cats for hours at a time. I will REALLY miss that part of living here  she really had so many kids to play with and it gave me some peace and quiet when I needed it! Also, we made a lot of friends here and it is a great supportive community (and the occasional babysitter when you need it!). There are coffee, tea, and candy in the office during business hours, and Jacque is often there to chat for a few minutes. If you have large packages, they will deliver them directly to your house if you so desire, and you dont have to wait til the office opens the next business day that way. It is close to Arlington Farms (the famed party complex), but I very rarely hear noise from there (I think once at night I was walking around and I heard a party, but inside my house I didnt hear a thing). It is right next to several buslines to UCD and it only takes 1018 minutes to get there on the bus, or it is about a 1518 minute bike ride to campus (bike paths the whole way). It is pretty close to Trader Joes, and you can take a three minute bike ride down the road to Westlake Village Market for a grocery store, salon, Mexican restaurant (authentic), Lamppost Pizza, a coffee shop/movie rental/copy store (all rolled into one), Curves gym, and probably more. There is also the Davis Community Acupuncture Clinic (sliding scale of $1540 per visit, and they are GREAT) right around the corner on West Covell and Lake (maybe a 10 minute bike ride). I am sure there are a lot more things I could say about living here. Just know that it is really nice, really supportive, really beautiful, really convenient, and I loved it. I wish I could stay! I am not surprised it won complex of the year once  it should win every year.  Users/KristinaWolf

20120817 16:16:41 nbsp I lived at Portage Bay for three years and loved it. The management staff is wonderful and maintenance issues were dealt with very quickly. The grounds are lovely and the management works hard to keep the apartments in very good condition. Overall, I highly recommend it as a place to live. Users/LMG

20130604 11:43:16 nbsp The maintenance manager Sal at Portage Bay is amazing. He is very friendly and skilled at what he does. Users/danray

20131022 10:13:37 nbsp This is a lovely apartment complex, very quiet and pretty.  I do miss the old manager Jacquie, but the new management is polite and does their jobs.  Maintenance staff are fantastic and repairs are completed same day or next day.  With the new management the complex has moved off the Davis model lease, rent for all units has increased, and you are only allowed one cat with the same $300 deposit that allowed you 3 cats before. There arent as many community activities as there were under Jacquie, and instead they are using the funds to install wrought iron fencing, put fake marble into the laundry rooms and took out the washbasins (how are we supposed to pretreat or wash bleach off our hands?) and didnt bother to buy new washers.  Prices of laundry also increased to $1.50 per wash and $1.50 per dry.  Management has also adopted a new policy where if you dont sign a paper allowing them to place packages in your apartment, they refuse the package and it gets sent back to the shipping center. I love it here, and I wish they would use the money for activities, updating the units, and keeping rent low rather than unnecessary remodeling that in some cases has reduced functionality.  Still a lovely place to live, just very different from what it was a year ago. LenaNicole

20131205 16:51:42 nbsp Ive lived in 3 different units at PB (due to roommates coming and going) over the past 3 years, and its been consistently awesome. Each time my leases ended and I had to choose whether I should stay or move to another complex, a few things have kept me here at Portage Bay. Its a fairly quiet complex at the edge of west Davis. My neighbors range from families to college students to single older people, and Ive only ever had problems with one (who didnt like our bass music). The 24hour laundry rooms that use cards (rather than quarters) make it easy to do my laundry when I have timeand my stuff cant get locked in there overnight! The grounds are beautiful, lots of trees and flowers (although hearing leaf blowers almost every day kinds sucks). Theres always parking in the lot, just be careful which tree you park under to avoid getting sapped on or pooped on... The office staff have always been super friendly and willing to work with me whenever there was an issue or I had a questioneven after Jackie left, which I was hesitant about because she was an awesome manager! So far, Amy seems pretty cool. But most of all, Ive stayed at Portage Bay because the maintenance guy, Sal, has always been able to promptly help with any problem I call about, from drain clogs to a heater fail. He wont quit until hes figured out what the problem is and solved it! He even helped me with my car when it wouldnt start! Good maintenance guys are hard to come by, and its really nice to be able to count on someone who will put in the time and effort it takes to actually solve a problem instead of ignoring it or quitting when it gets tough. Seriously though, Sal should get a raise!

Overall, Portage Bay is probably my favorite place Ive ever lived; its a real nice place to call home! Users/PeachDounias

20140103 15:15:36 nbsp I added a comment on this page right after I moved here, Sept 2011.  Every day of living here these two years has been a dream come true, and Ive just renewed for my third year (for which I was so surprised and delighted to receive a $100 laundry card). There arent enough superlatives to describe Sal, Amy, and Stephanie  they are beyond wonderful. They make Portage Bay feel like a family. Sal has been here the longest of the three, and he goes way above and beyond his job description  everyone here adores him. He has had several assistants, and all of them have been friendly and professional. Portage Bay is so beautiful  the pool and hot tub are extraordinary, the landscaping is beautiful (so many trees!), and the property is immaculate.  The new laundry rooms are wonderful.  What I especially love about Portage Bay is that its very, very quiet (this is not a party place and also dogs are not allowed), there are lots of older professionals as well as young families with young children (its a delight to watch them play together in the grassy courtyard area), and Portage Bay is very safe, with good lighting in every area.  My very, very favorite thing about our apartments is the large porches and large planters. I have had a big garden every summer on my porch  lots of tomatoes, peppers, lettuce, strawberries, and flowers.  Portage Bay is on the bus line and right down the street from Westlake grocery store, the Dollar Store, coffee shop, beauty salon, and several restaurants, including Lamppost Pizza. There are plenty of secure places on property for bikes.  The landscaping crew is on property on Wednesdays and, yes, thats a day of lots of noise from leaf blowers, but I think thats typical of any Davis apartment complex. The rent increases each year do not seem excessive; mine this year amounted to approximately $1.32/day increase.  I feel like thats a small price to pay for the joy of living here, especially the family atmosphere that Sal, Amy, and Stephanie create.  I never want to leave! Users/DeborahLattimore
