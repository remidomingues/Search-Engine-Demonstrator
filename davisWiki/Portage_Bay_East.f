Portage Bay East and Portage Bay West are two streets in West Davis that run from Lake Blvd. to Russell Blvd. Portage Bay was renamed Portage Bay East in the 80s when West Manor Park and Arlington Farm Arlington Farm Apartments were built adjacent to the southern tip of the West Manor home development. After several years, a barrier was put in place where East meets West in order to curb auto traffic through the residential section of West Manor. Other apartments and a restaurants restaurant along Portage Bay East include Portage Bay Apartments, Le Tournesol Apartments, and Osteria Fasulo.
