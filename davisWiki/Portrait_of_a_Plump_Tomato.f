Its plump.  Located outside the Davis Food Coop.  Dont eat it, the staff becomes irate, as the Tomatoes tomato is often a favorite for their staff pictures.

Portrait of a Tomato was unveiled on July 11, 2000.  It was created by GeraldHeffernon, and funded by the Davis Food Coop and a City of Davis City arts contract program.  The piece itself is made of high density polyurethan foam covered in epoxy resin and painted with car paint (to resist weather conditions).

Rumor has it that it is a subtle advertisement for XGenetically EngineeredX plump tomatoes.  After all, Square Tomato square tomatoes were developed hereabouts.
