Post Secret Davis is a local community mailart project modeled on Frank Warrens hugely successful http://www.postsecret.com PostSecret.

The organizers current goal is to collect 100 original secrets and have a showing at a Davis art gallery sometime during May 2011.

Everyone is encouraged to participate in this project. Secrets should be mailed on a 4x6 card. They can be a collage, drawing, photography photo or anything else the author/Local Artists artist wants to use (it does, however, have to fit in our standard sized mailbox). Be sure to use adequate postage! In most cases, a 44cent stamp should be enough.

Secrets should be mailed to the following address:

POST SECRET DAVIS
ASUCD BOX #133
ONE SHIELDS AVE.
DAVIS, CA 95616
