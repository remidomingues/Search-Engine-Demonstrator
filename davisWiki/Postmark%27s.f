Postmarks offers FedEx and UPS Shipping Services shipping services.  They also offer faxing services.   The original owner was named Mark, hence the possessive rather than plural name!

  I guess youd have to ask Mark.

20070714 08:40:39 nbsp Ive had a postal mail box at PostMarks for several months now. The staff is ALWAYS friendly. I havent shipped anything with them yet, but as far as PMBs go, they are everything and more. They recognize me by my face and, when I have a package to be picked up, they have it in hand before I even reach the counter. All the customers in the store have always seemed happy. It is rare that I find a business where every time I go in, the staff is always very pleasant and friendly. Users/Yves

20090613 17:09:38 nbsp This is a great place to do your business... I sell a lot of books and find PostMarks easier and even cheaper than USPS for shipping!  This is also kind of a one stop shop  he does keys, passport photos, mail, and all reasonably priced and honest. Users/soledad101

20091005 00:00:27 nbsp Hello All.  As previous comments mentioned, PostMarks changed ownership a couple of years ago.  Since then I have shipped several packages and purchased supplies there, and I always find the new owner extremely friendly and helpful.  He goes out of his way to assist me, and he makes the jobs of finding the best shipper and securely packaging items as easy as possible.  This is just the kind of business we need at the Mace Boulevard shopping center.  I strongly recommend the current (as of 20072009) PostMarks for your south Davis/El Macero packaging needs.

20121231 12:29:33 nbsp Shipped all my Christmas packages here and recently all of my books I sell on Amazon. I found the staff to be very helpful and courteous and I will continue to go here. Users/TJLanoue

20130220 15:17:04 nbsp I went in today to ship a few large items to New Zealand. They worked with me, trying to condense my two large boxes into one. They tried several options and ended up saving me over $100. I really appreciate the time they took to help me get the best deal. And no line like there always is at the post office!
