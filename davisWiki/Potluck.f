Bring a dish to share with everyone, plus serving utensils. Bring your own plate/bowl and silverware for yourself. Be considerate of the group youre visiting; dont bring bacon to the Jewish Vegan potluck... Most people bring vegetarian options vegetarian dishes out of consideration to vegetarians. Sometimes people place cards listing ingredients next to their dishes, for those with food allergies, etc. Dont be a cheapskate either. Bring enough to fill you up, if you were to eat it all yourself. Drinks are usually in short supply, so quality juices are always appreciated. Specialty items (for example, potstickers) are appreciated. Go with the spirit of giving, instead of receiving, and youll be fine.
