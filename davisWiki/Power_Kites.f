Power kites are large kites designed for extreme sports.  These sports include Kite buggying, Kite surfing, Snowkiting, and Kiteboarding.  Power Kites come in a range of sizes and are measured in square meters.  A variety of designs exist but most are basically a smaller version of a paraglider.  For more information go to www.powerkiteforum.com
There are a handfull of Powerkiters in the Davis area, most use a kite buggy because these work well in a variety of conditions.
There are only a few areas in Davis suitable for such activities which consist of large grass fields, so it is often necissary to travel to dry lake beds or wide beaches such as Ocean Beach in San Francisco.

20080427 22:43:12 nbsp not much to do with Davis in particular.

20080428 08:15:08 nbsp I sent an email to Rob, I will repost the photos when written permission is given.  The best place to go here in Davis are the sod farms in south davis.  Because the farms are private property, we have gotten permission from the owner to use the fields.  Good public lawns include the Harper Jr. High east lawn and the Nugget fields in north Davis.
