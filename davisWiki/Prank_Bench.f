This Address(Benches bench, 38.5717, 121.754386) has had a prank memorial plaque on it since at least 2000.  The plaque names wiki:Sacramento web celebrity and local stage show prop builder wiki:Sacramento:Rob Cockerham of the wonderful Locally Owned Websites website http://www.cockeyed.com cockeyed.com, though the prank was apparently performed independently by a friend of his.  It is located on the the greenbelt in Northstar Park just south of the parking entrance on Grosbeak Court.
