20070518 20:47:40 nbsp One of my coworkers was saying today that theyre putting in a Trader Joes at the upcoming Target/Costco shopping center at the intersection of Rd 102/I5 in Woodland.  I tried to find details about it online but was unsuccessful.  Could be hes wrong, but I thought Id mention it anyway. Users/AlexPomeranz

20070909 17:06:03 nbsp I love Trader Joes. Im tired of having to ride my motorcycle 18 miles just to go to the one in SAC. At least they dont treat their workers like slaves.  Users/DavidHolcomb

20080828 23:38:02 nbsp Another thing about TJs that hasnt been noted is the fact that you can get basic stuff here for great prices. For example, the prices of butter, eggs, and cream at Trader Joes are almost half of what they are at Safeway. The same can be said of nuts and cheese. I cant wait until this comes in.

20080919 23:06:56 nbsp Shame Im going to be gone when they finally open in Davis. Id love to see someone give the Coop a run for its money. Users/SMCareBare

20081212 21:09:08 nbsp I am allergic to soy and Trader Joes is the only place I can find prepared, high quality, organic, fair trade foods that I can eat and afford.  I dont believe that the Coop will be threatened by TJs any more than its threatened by Safeway, etc.

20090302 21:10:47 nbsp So, are they still planning on building it? When will it open? I live RIGHT next to U mall, I wish it was there! I want TJs!!!! Users/Jaclyn

20090727 02:24:42 nbsp I hear that it will be a Forever 21 taking over the space in the University Mall. I hope it is the Forever 21, a person I know who works at the Forever 21 in Arden Mall has said that she is pretty certain that we are getting a Forever 21 store in Davis. It will carry both the womens and mens line of clothing. YAY! Users/ThUn

  Sorry to burst your bubble, and I may be wrong, but I hear from one of the vendors in the Mall that the lease for Forever 21 was rejected by the owners of the Mall for various reasons, including rent and whether it was the best use of the space. Users/condemned2bfree
  The original bid was rejected late June, but the UMall owners were still negotiating with Forever 21 as well as with other unnamed potential tenants, as reported in the Enterprise. The Enterprise speculated that they could also be talking with Trader Joes, but I dont think there was any evidence to support that other than hearsay, because the owners did not say who they were talking to. There hasnt really been any other news since then. Users/jsogul
   So it looks like well be getting a Forever 21 after all. Just hope they will carry the mens line of clothing too so that it remains diverse and useful to all of the community. Users/ThUn

20100525 01:02:53 nbsp Im rather disappointed that they chose to construct this new building with cinderblock. I hope they put stucco on the exterior.  Users/jsogul

20100528 17:03:17 nbsp Its about time. TJs is wonderful! I cant wait! Users/LizzyT

20100601 20:31:59 nbsp It isnt as simple as just moving into the Gottschalks space. I once worked at a new grocery store that had taken over an existing retail location. The amount of money spent on remodeling the place was enormous. They had to rebuild the entire back half of the store, leaving only the exterior walls standing. They had to add a walkin freezer, a number of stainless sinks and counters (per OSHA requirements), and the electrical capacity to handle the milk fridges, produce section, etc. It was a huge pain in the ass, and the building still wasnt ideal after all the remodeling was finished. Maybe Trader Joes just decided it would be easier to build an entirely new building which would have the exact layout and facilities they wanted. Users/twblalock
  Agreed, reusing a department store space for specialty groceries isnt simple. I will assert one more time that the biggest reason for a freestanding building is that this is what they wanted. Theyre a giant chain, they adapt to the location into which they expand, but they dont adapt that much because that takes both time and money. TJs thrive on visibility and traffic: theres not much else driving foot traffic past the former Gottschalks space, and you dont see it every time you drive by. QED, IMO. Users/DougWalter

20100629 11:40:55 nbsp Cant wait for a walking distance Traders Joe! Though the building is quite ugly as of now  hopefully they put in some windows!  Users/LeeY

20100902 09:09:39 nbsp Went by last night and it looks like it is close to being finished.  Anyone know if there is a grand opening date yet? Users/BigGuy

20100902 10:19:55 nbsp Im really impressed by the speed at which this building is being built. Seems like the exterior is done and they are now working on the interior. Id estimate that itll open by the start of the quarter, just in time for freshmentoting families!  Users/blastoff

20100915 13:55:49 nbsp Does anyone know when they start hiring...or if they have already and where to apply? Users/pixiegal3

20100915 17:17:02 nbsp Super pumped that TJs is coming to Davis. Its about time!  Users/103

20101005 09:25:26 nbsp TJs is opening in Davis on October 29  according to the manager of the Roseville store. Users/JonFenske
 20101013 The October 29th opening date is confirmed by todays press release: http://www.davisenterprise.com/comings_and_goings/?p1114  Users/LillianChow

20101026 21:27:43 nbsp Anyone know if theyre going to have a soft open before Friday? Users/RobertM525

20101029 14:44:55 nbsp Did anyone else apply to work here and get disappointed by the fact that no letters or calls were made to inform an applicant that they were not chosen to interview?  Have heard this a few times in my circle of friends.  Ill give this place a try, but definitely want to see if the above comment about cheaper than Safeway is true. Users/redbike

20101029 15:42:20 nbsp @ redbike: apparently they got over 2500 applications for 60 spots, and just stopped counting at a certain point: http://search.davisenterprise.com/display.php?id71013 Users/ToddGreen
