Preethi Indian Cuisine is a arriving businesses recently arrived restaurant that serves south and north Indian food. They provide catering services, providing offmenu things like fresh kulfi if this is done.  This is not your standard Davis Indian/Nepalese restaurant. It is mainly Southern Indian, which is a whole new experience.   There are great vegetarians vegetarian fare and nonvegetarian options on the menu.

Preethi has a lunch buffets buffet seven days a week, from 11:00am to 3:00pm on weekdays for $8.99, and 11:00am to 3:30pm on weekends. They are open till midnight on Friday and Saturday. Happy hour is 3:00 P.M. until 5:00 P.M.  If you buy a beer or wine, you get a free appetizer.  They also do catering.

They occasionally offer dinner buffets for Hindu festivals such as Diwali.

This location was previously occupied by Bombay Dreams Restaurant. They left their wall painting of the Buddha up and incorporated it into the restaurants decor.  It seems the register still prints Bombay Dreams on the receipt.


20120520 14:43:17 nbsp Best indian food in Davis, hands down! Good for both veg & nonveg options. Pleasant ambience, not too expensive either. Users/kijacker

20120531 23:47:36 nbsp Went here a few weeks ago. I love this place, it has both South and North Indian food (you NEVER see South unless youre like in the Silicon Valley), and is a lot better than places like Zindagis, which we had just tried the previous week.  Users/chandru

20120606 15:34:34 nbsp Just not the same as Bombay Dreams.  Sigh... Users/ellenjoyce

20120607 14:28:31 nbsp I just went this week and the the lunch buffet was awesome. There served lasses to everyone automatically, they had delicious butter chicken, they just kept bringing out the naan, and they even served us Masala Dosa, which I had never had before. Really good food and friendly service.  Users/SeanNittner

20120607 20:10:24 nbsp Friends and I went here a few weeks ago. The service was very kind and friendly. They serve both North and South Indian food (finally!), and their Southern food is apparently pretty good according to friends whod know. They start you off with appalam and mint, mango, and coconut chutneys. Their naan is fluffy, the rice is nice and fragrant, and all their food is pretty nicely spiced. I remember in particular liking the bharwan baingan, very soft and delicious. The dining experience was pleasant (very good atmosphere, comfortable too) and the prices were very reasonable for the quality and location. Plenty of veg and non veg stuff here. Definitely coming back here. Along with Rajas, its my favorite Indian food place in Davis.

Apparently they also cater, and if you have enough people theyll make kulfi! Users/AlexTK

20120611 17:12:28 nbsp I had such high hopes for this place since South Indian food is hard to find.  However, when we walked in the door we were greeted with borderline hostility.  To be fair, we had a twoyear old in tow but we also made a point of coming at a time when there would be few other patrons to disturb.  The food was fine, but not good enough to make me want to brave the icy stares of the staff again.     Users/BlytheDurbinJohnson

20120628 19:32:03 nbsp Had a bad takeout experience here. Chicken tikka masala  chicken dry and overcooked, cream added when sauce too hot meaning that it split. Very poor. Okra was just okay, goat curry was mediocre, garlic naan was inedible (entire head of raw garlic spread over normal naan). Quite expensive altogether, and highly unlikely that well eat the leftovers. Wont be coming back. Sorry.     Users/McBeeves

20120630 08:28:53 nbsp Great new restaurant in town! The only place in Davis that we have found to get South Indian dishesdosas, idli, etc.and they are excellent. Attentive service, very good (and spicy!) food. We had a great meal. Users/JeffJudyReynolds

20120709 13:05:00 nbsp Finally created an account to proclaim this restaurant from the rooftops. It is a class above Davis other Indian/Nepalese places (although several are quite good). Ordered a thali dinner and the South Indian combo appetizer for the two of us... which would have been enough for three. Everything was excellent, especially the Chicken Makhani and the okra/peanut veg curry of the day. Whats more, the waitress later told us that during happy hour there is a coupon to get half off an entree if you buy one at full price.. she applied this for us without us requesting it and even though we didnt even purchase two entrees! Great food, enough for three, for 20 dollars and change. Ill be back often. Users/wpear

20120710 21:51:34 nbsp This is not your standard Davis Indian/Nepalese restaurant. It is mainly Southern Indian, which is a whole new experience. The dosa was excellent and the southern Indian sampler  amazing. Give this place a try before you think it is like everywhere else  you wont be sorry.   Users/annemeck

20120710 22:07:37 nbsp We loved the south Indian specialties  the huge dosas and savory sambar were like being back in Kerala.  The owners were very generous and treated our two young children like family, offering extra mango lassis (best in town) and a whole plate of idli on the house.  The prices were very reasonable and we left knowing that we will be bringing friends next time. Users/RyD

20120713 00:49:02 nbsp HALLELUJAH! Finally, South Indian cuisine in Davis! After spending 10 weeks in India, Im picky about the Indian food I eat, and dont care for toned down spices to suit the American palate or fusion Indian food. You wont find either of those here  this place serves up the real deal. Before I even settled into my table, the young woman who greeted me brought over a mango lassi that had a sweet, intense mango flavor  the perfect welcoming ritual! I sampled several dishes, all of them excellent. The veggie pakora were so fresh and perfectly crunchy  my kids couldnt stop eating them. The veggie samosa was just the way I like it  generously packed with potatoes and peas with a unique spice blend. Last, but not least, the dosa. Oh, how Ive been craving a good dosa since moving to Davis 7 years ago. This one was bangon. The pancake was soft on the inside, crispy around the edges and lightly filled with a curry veggie mix. All of the dishes were enhanced with a delicious selection of chutneys  the mint chutney was my favorite; my kids loved the sweet dark brown chutney; my husband liked the blowyourtopoff spicy tomato chutney.
I chatted up the young woman working there, who turned out to be the owners daughter. She said her father and mother do all the cooking in the restaurant, because they want to make sure all the food is prepared correctly according to their tradition, and no customer leaves unsatisfied.
Cant wait to go back and try the lunch buffet! Users/BujhaGee

20120715 18:22:50 nbsp OMG  fantastic! I went here for the first time last night, and my friend and I shared palaak paneer (spinach with cheese cubes) and mango chicken. Superb, the best in Davis and Sacramento. So tonight I took my daughter, and the owner immediately started piling our table with delicious new things, of which I know only some of the names: mango lassi, dosa, papadam, chutneys, dal, vegetable curry, mahi mahi tikka, and other unnamed yummies cooked by the gracious owners. And the service was excellent  by the owners daughter. It was such a wonderful meal experience that my daughter wants to go here to celebrate her 15th birthday! Users/Chamoudah

20120721 20:36:31 nbsp Preethi has excellent food and even better service.  I have a nut allergy and the waitress expertly helped me navigate the dishes I wasnt familiar with and conferred with the cooks to make sure there was no contamination.  The naan was great too...very fresh! Users/BSchreier

20120722 17:32:10 nbsp I was very surprised and excited to find this delicious Indian food!!! An especially good find since they serve South Indian cuisine, including Masala Dosas and Uttapam, along with coconut sambar and dipping sauces. The closest place to get South Indian food that Ive found is at Dosa in SF. Im thrilled to have this one here, so please patronize this place and keep it around! The staff is very friendly and attentive, and they told me that the owners are from Hyderabad in South India. It is a different experience from the North Indian/Nepalese Kathmandu, which I also like, and it really has its own unique niche. It need not be seen as competition. The Tikka Masala has an excellent South Indian flavor, and the samosas were crisp, delicious and fresh! If you are not familiar with South Indian food, come try it out here. Order an Uttapam with chili and garlic and a Masala Dosa. You wont be sorry! Users/MichaelGrofe

20120929 10:43:48 nbsp Yum. Yum. YUM! Wow, we went in to Preethie for dinner last night and left with happy bellies. SO many vegetarian options to choose from! The korma was the best Ive ever tasted; so creamy and flavorful I licked the bowl clean. The lentils, pakora and aloo gobi were super tasty with spices that all blended together into a symphony of deliciousness. The naan was pillowy soft and the perfect sponge to mop up every last drop. We will absolutely be back with our kids. Users/DebWestergaard

  Did your korma have a coconut flavor to it?  I thought I tasted coconut, but my idea of medium seems to be equivalent to Indianrestaurantmild and its difficult to tell sometimes about the underlying seasonings.  Users/JudithTruman

20121126 12:27:01 nbsp This is the only restaurant Ive felt compelled to write a Davis Wiki review about. The food is fantastic. It may be a buffet, but I feel like the food is above buffet quality for a buffet price. Like SeanNitter mentioned, the service is great as well: they kept bringing out naan, masala dosa, and mango lassi to go with our buffet food. I cant recommend this place enough. Users/MatthewPorter

20121210 08:27:25 nbsp Will Preethi be open on Xmas? (Youd get all of us Davis Jews!) Users/Chamoudah

20130104 17:34:32 nbsp I had heard South Indian food is generally healthier of Indian cuisine, but I ended up ordering vindalu a thali. It was delicious, a lot of food. I went on Christmas, so service was a little slow since Im assuming it was one of the only places open on Christmas and everyone went. I really enjoyed my food, and Id be interested in studying here sometime.  Users/HannahToru

20130515 22:11:20 nbsp Absolutely best buffet. There are many choices, and they dont compromise quality. In addition to providing chai tea, they serve fresh hot naan, garlic naan, dosa, vada, and mango lassi to your table.
They also sometimes have special dinner buffets on Indian holidays, like Diwali and Ugadi. I went to the one for Diwali last year because they advertised having over 50 items or something, but many of them were missing, probably because its a very difficult task to coordinate.
Anyways, the takeaway here is the lunch buffet. The other Indian restaurants have a lot of work to do... Users/TheShah

20140427 16:43:57 nbsp I rarely write reviews on the Wiki, but Ive been so impressed by Preethi that I want to comment! Ive gone here several times for buffet and dinner, both a la carte and thali. Ive always been impressed by the kindness of all staff members, the quality of the food, their cheerfulness to provide certain offmenu items, attentiveness to special food needs/choices, the ambiance  absolutely everything. I love that they provide mango lassi, hot chai, and fresh naan to the table during the lunch buffet for the same price as other Indian restaurants in town...I think that extra effort really shows the care everyone puts into the restaurant. I always leave this place feeling happily full, but not like I just consumed anything unhealthy. Users/AllisonBarnard

20140730 12:17:08 nbsp Best lunch buffet in town! A million times better than Rajas and totally worth the extra $3. Users/ToddKaiser
