Pregnancy Loss Support Groups

Now Forming



If you have experienced a pregnancy loss . . .

First and foremost, I am so sorry for your loss.  Pregnancy loss can be devastating, no matter when it happens or what the circumstances may be.  Such an experience often brings up feelings of sadness, depression, anger, guilt, and anxiety.  Your hopes and dreams for the future may be dashed and you may feel as if you will never be quite the same again.  The rollercoaster of hormones, thoughts, and emotions can be truly overwhelming.

You are not alone!

While studies demonstrate that up to 25% of women will experience at least one miscarriage during their childbearing years (making miscarriage the most common complication of early pregnancy) and an average of one stillbirth takes place every 20 minutes in the United States, pregnancy loss is one of the most difficult and isolating experiences many women will have.  Sharing with others who have experienced pregnancy loss can be both comforting and healing.  Come, be with others who understand.

About the Group

These groups, which meet in Davis and Sacramento, are intended to provide a safe place to meet and share, to give and receive support.  Please contact Julie directly at (916) 8024198 or Julie@SagePsychotherapy.org for additional information (including dates, times, and fee) or to express interest.  All potential group members are invited to schedule a free 30minute phone consultation to speak with Julie and determine if this group will be a good fit for you and your needs.  Whether your pregnancy loss occurred weeks, months, or even more than a year ago – you are welcome.

Facilitated by Julie Jorgenson, MA

My name is Julie Jorgenson, Marriage and Family Therapist Intern Julie Jorgenson and I am a Marriage and Family Therapist Intern (#66457) in private practice at Sage Psychotherapy and Treatment Program, under the supervision of Robin Kirk, MFT (#37167).  I completed my Master’s degree in Marital and Family Therapy from Western Seminary and treat a wide range of emotional and behavioral concerns which span from therapy for depression and grief to parenting support, couples counseling and beyond.  I especially enjoy working with women in their “reproductive years” and have developed an area of treatment focus on perinatal (pregnancy and postpartum) depression and anxiety as well as pregnancy loss.
