20100514 14:44:31 nbsp I just passed by the front and it doesnt look like it will be opening for a while.  I LOVE Ethiopian food.  About time something other than a Thai Restaurant came in Davis.  Users/JonFenske

20100520 14:51:28 nbsp I live right next to Little Ethiopia in LA, and I cant stress just how excited I am for this! Ive been to Queen of Sheba in Sac 23 times and its pretty awesome. The owner is really nice also, so im sure the Davis community will absolutely love this place. Users/DavidTurkell

20100527 19:50:06 nbsp Anyone have a firm date on when it will open? Users/BillKendrick

20100601 17:15:38 nbsp Is it open?  Inquiring minds want to know! Users/TomGarberson

20100603 17:41:42 nbsp Called their Sac number and they said the Davis restaurant should be open next week (which would be the week of June 612). Users/BillKendrick

20100609 16:13:04 nbsp I talked to the owner today and she said it will be opening within the next week (by June 16). Users/JonFenske

20100611 20:44:21 nbsp Im so excited for this!!! It better still be in business in September. Users/AlisaKim

20100628 11:13:01 nbsp Does anyone know if this restaurant has opened yet or a new tentative opening date? Users/B.Egan

20100628 11:16:03 nbsp I walked by yesterday  not yet open. Looks like its still getting worked on. Users/EdwardNiemand

20100701 17:52:16 nbsp Ive been calling every week and the owner said a couple days ago they were looking forward to opening this weekend. I am excited. My friends and I have gone to their Sacramento location many times.  Users/Dimitri
  They told me the same thing a month and  a half ago. Im excited for it to open too, but Ill believe it when I see it. Users/ScottWeintraub
   They still have the sign up from Pita Pit saying the store has closed. Peeking inside, it looks like they have a long ways to go.  Users/WilliamLewis
  I would concur, but it looks like its moving along
  Place your bets: Will we see a Trader Joes in Davis before Ethiopian food? :P
  The always changing opening schedule of this place is completely in line with my experiences in East Africa. They have a different relationship with time and distance over there... to put it mildly.  On a positive note, this will definitely be an authentic Ethiopian restaurant.

20100705 13:23:09 nbsp I am so thrilled there will be an Ethiopian eatery in Davis! It is just what this town needs! Maybe it will allow me to hate this town a little less? Users/AlvinoGina

20100705 21:20:49 nbsp Im looking forward to this as well!  I just found out today that Addis Ababa in Sac (Alta Arden and Fulton) closed its doors recently.  I was so bummed. Loved that little place and the family that owned it. Users/MichaelMacIntosh

20100713 11:36:05 nbsp I just called and the lady said this place will be open on July 14 Users/tombrokaw

20100713 15:17:32 nbsp Latest update  there is a slim chance they will open on July 14.  They still have one more inspection.  My guess is Friday July 16 at the earliest.     Users/JonFenske

20100714 11:22:36 nbsp does anyone have the number for this place?  I called the sac location and asked if this place would be open.  She said 11:30. I asked if she had the direct number to the Davis location.  She said uh yeah.  bye  then hung up.   Users/tombrokaw

20100715 13:58:04 nbsp Email seems to be the best bet. I got a reponse once via email that it would open in May. I too had no luck via phone. When I called last week when asking when the Davis spot would open, she said 11:30  I tired to clarify and she said uh yeah. bye then hung up. I hope they open soon.  Users/ces139

20100715 22:06:41 nbsp On Jul 14, I went there in person and asked the man working on renovations when the place would open.  He said in the next few days.  Although admittedly from the state of the place it seemed quite a bit more than a few days away. Users/tombrokaw
