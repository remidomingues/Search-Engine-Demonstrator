20100303 06:36:48 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. Thanks for adding the new photo, but why remove another editors contribution? Users/JasonAller

20100303 21:29:14 nbsp Thank you, Jason. I clearly was not minding my manners. Just to explain, though not excuse: After volunteering at the Arboretum for a little over a year doing database maintenance in Nursery Records, I offered to do something a little more in line with my work as a technical communicator. They said theyd like to have a more uptodate and attractive presentation on the Davis Wiki. So I thoughtlessly replaced the picture as part of an editing exercise and a test. Ill study the guidelines for the wiki and any future work will be more in line with whats expected of contributors. My apologies. Prescott Williams Users/PrescottWilliams

20100303 21:31:24 nbsp The arboretum is a ripe source of content for the wiki. Dont worry about it, the whole collaborative editing thing takes some getting used to. Users/JasonAller

20100406 18:59:08 nbsp Hey, just so you know, {{{Rabbits}}} and {{{rabbits}}} will both point to the same entry, Rabbits.  The links are not case sensitive, so it tends to be easier to edit them lower case rather than linking them like {{{Rabbits rabbits}}}.  The goal of lowercasing them all is a great edit, just letting you know an easier way to do the same thing. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20100417 01:54:40 nbsp Hey Prescott. The page looks better. Thanks for organizing the photos into sections. I kept telling myself I was gonna edit that page but it just had stuff all over the place. To be honest, I dont know a perfect page, but some of the campus pages where there are photos that go along with text in corresponding sections is good. I just think there might be too many pictures for each section on the arboretum page. There several of ducks which could be cropped down to one, and maybe the one of fish could be moved to the arboretum waterway page. I dunno. These are just some thoughts. Thanks again!
