 L.E.A.D. 

 Candidate Statement:

We are determined to build a stronger student association. This year ASUCD has yet again been marred by scandals. However, these issues are the direct result of a greater problem. The codes by which ASUCD operates are flawed and inconsistent. Given the constant turnover of student leadership, the system must be reformed to ensure continuity and to make clear the intent of questionable rules. This reform must begin with our proposed constitutional amendment to prohibit the passage of retroactive laws in ASUCD. We are also striving to improve the quality of campus life while maintaining a fiscally responsible budget. We have designed our platform to meet the demands of the student population without placing additional financial burdens on the student association in a time of financial crisis. We will improve the quality of existing ASUCD services including Tipsy Taxi and the Book Exchange without taking actions that will make it necessary to increase your student fees in the future. A great deal of responsibility is placed in the hands of the executive office and representation of the student voice beyond our campus is crucial. Students are a driving force of the local economy and account for nearly 50% of DavisÂ’ population. Yet students have little influence over city policies which target them, such as the open container law and noise ordinances, which is why we will institutionalize yearround voter registration through the ASUCD Office of External Affairs. Beyond local issues we have also been outspoken on the larger issues which have mattered most to students, including the $12 billion in cuts to federal student aid. Our collaborative advocacy efforts have garnered positive attention from national and local media outlets. Next year we will continue to represent the best interests of the students on all levels. We urge you to do your part in building a stronger student association by voting for Darnell Holloway and Genna Carnes for ASUCD President ASUCD executive office. Thank You.
