I dont think the wiki has ever had a press release, but its a really great way to get picked up by local media. Lets face it, newspapers, magazines, TV stations are lazy, most news you read/see comes from a press release. However, we cant just say PRESS RELEASE: Davis Wiki IS Press releases pertain to an event. Were about to hit 5000 pages, so have at it.

For the newbie: Heres a few tips on http://www.ehow.com/how_8793_writepressrelease.html How to Write a Press Release.  Some points are irrelevant, but pay special attention to #6 and what it says about the first paragraph of a press release.

Should we set a __deadline__ for the final draft?  Or at least a __target date__?  As a point to be contested, I suggest that we have it done by __Thursday at Noon__.  Then, also, is someone already assigned the task of sending it off to the appropriate media outlets?
  Thursday at noon sounds great.  I can send it off to media outlits at noon tomorrow.

  I suppose Ill hold off mailing it out as the state seems contested right now (and not yet complete). Users/PhilipNeustrom

 Places to send a press release: 
  The Davis Enterprise
  The Sacramento Bee
  The Daily Democrat
  The California Aggie  ha!
  Wired Magazine (a guy can dream, cant he? i mean, we are the largest, most sucessful local wiki...)
  http://www.worldnewspapers.com/newsmagazine.html This is a list of news magazines.  Most have some sort of tech section, and all could get a press release.  you never know who might decide this was interesting enough to publish.
  UCD Housing and other places might also be interested in distributing this info to new students...

Does anyone know how much lead time these media outlets need? Does it matter if we get the news out a few days after it happens? Well, now that the 5000th Page is here the issue is sort of forced.

 Alternative Drafts that YOU Should Revise (in progress)

DavisWiki, an online communitybuilt website, reaches yet another milestone: 5,000 pages of information, commentary, directions, and people. The website is an interconnected community effort to explore, discuss and compile anything and everything about Davis.  DavisWiki is maintained by the people who use it: anyone can edit the website and contribute to the project.

The 5,000 page milestone will be celebrated by (insert planned events here)

DavisWiki is a central resource for finding out whats going on in town. The 5000 pages include current events in Davis, insightful history, reviews of restaurants and businesses, and information about little known community gems.

Davis California is as well known for its eccentricities as it is for its grassroots devotion to a smalltown community lifestyle.  Recently community members have crafted a unique Internet niche for the city as well.  Over the past year, hundreds of volunteers from this agricultural college town have been documenting and compiling an enormous website, known as the DavisWiki, with information and pictures concerning all aspects of this citys culture, history, and daytoday life.  This week the DavisWiki reached a milestone of 5000 pages, all of which were created and continue to be revised by anyone and everyone (maybe even you!) with an interest in the city and community of Davis.  Anyone can log on and easily edit pages in the website with only entrylevel keyboard and mouse skills.  This ease of use, along with the many fascinating Davisoriented subjects covered, are fueling the explosive growth of the website.  Log on and learn something new.  Or share with others your perspective on some aspect the city.  http://www.daviswiki.org

The depth and detailed information on the Davis Wiki is remarkable for locally oriented websites of its kind, blowing all the conventional and commericiallycreated local guides and portals out of the water.

We need examples of random and useful pages to place __right here__.  See http://blogs.forrester.com/charleneli/2005/08/local_search_de.html this blog entry for an example of what I mean (she talks about Davis Wiki in it).
  the flora pages is probably the best thing to discuss here as its for pure enjoyment and education, and serves no commercial purpose
  housing guide
  restaurants, which provide both objective info about restaurants, and more subjective comments
  wifi hotspots
  the editable map!!
  dumpster diving

This difference in quality and content is due largely to the freely editable nature of the website.  The unique form of the website, known as a wiki, means that anyone can log on and easily edit pages in the website with only entrylevel keyboard and mouse skills.  This ease of use, along with the many fascinating Davisoriented subjects covered, are fueling the explosive growth of the website.

UC Davis graduate student Users/CraigBrozinsky Craig Brozinsky treats the DavisWiki as a consumer advocacy tool. I constantly hear about mechanics and landlords taking advantage of students in Davis. The Daviswiki provides a forum to publicly acknowledge dishonest practices and promote more communityminded businesses.

(For when we reach 7500 nonredirect pages)

DavisWiki, ( daviswiki.org ) a free online communitybuilt website, has reached an important milestone. Collectively the users have contributed content about Davis and edited it. This Date reference they created their 7500^th^ page of content. The volunteer effort has resulted in a resource that contains information about Davis spanning everything from businesses to bands, City Council to Local Wildlife. 7500 pages is significant because that is the worldwide standard by which to separate the little wikis from the big ones.


(commentary for C) I think B is much better than A, but the bottom portion seems a bit confused.  It goes from I dont know what Davis is to log on and edit!  a confusing message because there are two potential targets:  those in Davis and those outside Davis.  Also, I like the idea of including some quotes, and it makes it way easier for newspapers to write articles.  Most news writing is, after all, filling the space around quotes.  I think it might be good to get as many quotes from townspeople as possible that have good titles.

Also, theres no reason to be modest in a press release.  Press releases are basically fluff and theyre read as fluff.


Sorry guys, but B and C are just too convuluted and pretensious. Were trying to write a press release here, not get a B in freshman English. Get to the damn point. Are we trying to advertise Davis the city, or DavisWiki? If its the latter, than lead with it. THe news should go in this order: Severalword description of what DavisWiki is, followed by the fact that it a 5000 page milestone. Then, the importance of the milestone and the fact that DavisWiki is one of the biggest community wikis. Then talk about whatever gathering youre going to have to celebrate. Then a fuller description of what a wiki is. Then examples of cool pages and why this site is so helpful. THEN, all the flowery BS about how great Davis and Davis wiki is.

And for shits sake, dont use the verb blowing.  Users/ApolloStumpy
