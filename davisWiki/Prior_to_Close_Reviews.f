20071028 23:05:20 nbsp Where do you get cold stone coupons? I have never seen any.

Also, I love our cold stone here. They give you great portions! It is the best ice cream in town. Their ice cream is usually fresh, but try not to get flavors that look unpopular (Theyve been there a while I think). Once I tried the low fat Cake Batter, and the ice cream was grainy and disgusting. I really should have taken that one back for something else, but I felt guilty because I tasted it and the spoon I tried was fine.

I really wish they had Dollar days like BR! They are way better than Baskin Robbins, but BR is a much better deal on Tuesday. They have deals during weekdays right now, but they arent nearly as good.  Users/AnnaF
