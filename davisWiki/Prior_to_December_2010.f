Prior to December 2010, Red Orchid had the same ownership as Davis Noodle City; the new owners kept the shabu shabu but changed the menu considerably.  Previously, the nonshabu shabu Red Orchid menu had considerable overlap with the Davis Noodle City menu, with the same homemade noodles.  The comments are retained here for historical purposes.

20080611 15:03:04 nbsp As a fan of dim sum and Davis Noodle City, I was excited that (1) a restaurant marketing itself as a dim sum restaurant was opening in Davis and (2) it was operated by the family that owns Noodle City.  On its second day of operation, we ate there and were disappointed.

We had steamed BBQ pork buns, shrimp dumplings, chives box, and Red Orchid Noodles.  The noodles were finea thick pan fried noodle dish, although heavy on noodles and light on veggies and meat.  The dim sum was very disappointing, and we were pretty confident that the buns and dumplings were frozen (the shrimp and dumpling were commingled into a common paste).

Well wait for someone else to try it and cross our fingers that itll be like wine and not dim sum and get better with age...  Users/ScottLay

20080611 22:40:01 nbsp Everything we ordered was amazing. We ordered the Shabu and Dim Sum.. The service was impeccable. The waiter (I think he was the owner too?) was very friendly and helpful. I was amazed at how organized everything was for having been open only 3 days. Overall, it cost $41 for four people to eat dinner and be really full. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants an incredible meal in a nice environment for a minimal amount of money.  Users/wunder1

20080612 08:43:48 nbsp The Shabu Shabu is wonderful. Very fresh and large portions. Great selection of Dim Sum and excellent staff. The price cant be beat and I plan to return again and again.  Users/GarySaylin

20080612 08:56:54 nbsp Im glad others have had a better experience...perhaps Ill return to try the shabushabu. Users/ScottLay

20080613 09:56:20 nbsp shabu shabu is decent. However, I think the shui mai is exactly the same brand I buy at kims mart. Its not that frozen har gow or shu mai taste bad, infact its quite tasty, but at a restaurant I dont want to be paying a huge markup on the stuff I buy regularly from the local Asian market. If you have ever had any of these dumpling type dishes at a real dim sum place like New Canton in sacramento or any of the places on Irving street or china town in San Fransisco, you will be in for a huge disappointment. Now the dim sum items that are pulled over from the noodle city menu are pretty good, but the traditional dim sum items just dont satisfy. Besides being frozen, they are small, maybe a little larger than a quarter. If you factor in the size the prices are bad for a dim sum place. They also serve some of the more popular noodle city dishes as well. Really they should lose the dim sum and call it noodle city plus Shabu shabu. Users/MattHh

20080616 19:36:41 nbsp I am not sure how folks can tell if a dumpling has been frozen or not. I would imagine a vast majority of dim sum is probably prepared and frozen in advance regardless of the location. I went there last Friday, and was quite pleased. I just uploaded the menu, and heres a rundown of what I got. Cream Cheese Wontons  standard fare, nothing particularly interesting. Crispy Tofu  Wow! Never had anything like this. Imagine a deep fried cube of cheese, with semimolten cheese inside and a delicious crunchy exterior, except made from tofu. Came with a spicy sauce that really complimented this well. Fantastic. Fried Green Onion Bread  Tasty, but a little doughy for my taste. My lunch companions liked it quite a bit, but it is a thick Naanlike bread as opposed to the crispy thin green onion cake/bread that I have had at other places. Little Pork Steamed Buns  essentially steamed potstickers, these are tasty, with lots of pork and ginger flavor. Vegetable Chives Box  interesting pupusastyle stuffed bread similar to the fried green onion bread, but filled with a flavorful mix of green onions and glass noodles.  A little heavy for my taste, but excellent mix of flavor and texture. Steamed Shrimp Dumplings  your typical http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Har_gow Har Gow, good flavor, nice plump shrimp, no hint of the common paste mentioned in other reviews. These were pretty much exactly like most other Har Gow Ive had at other good quality Dim Sum restaurants. Shanghai Style Donut  a small medallion of breading filled with green onion paste. I would have liked this better with more of a paste to bread ratio. Rice with Chicken in Lotus Leaf  this has a strong Shittake mushroom flavor, which some may find somewhat overwhelming. If you like lotus leaf and shittake mushroom flavor, you will love this. Definitely a good way to fill up. Minced Fish Soymilk Skin Roll  Dont let the name fool you, this thing is the star of the show. It is a roll of what I assume to be fried tofu skin, with a filling of some kind of mushroom and other chewy vegetablelike item. I could not detect anything fishy about it, but it had an amazing depth of flavor and a phenomenal unusual texture. I had to request a second order.

Hope that gives some folks a more specific idea of whats available. In my book, its highly recommended, and a wonderful addition to Davis sorely lacking Dim Sum offerings. Users/ChrisLambertus
 Its not that they are frozen, thats fine. Many places probably make their dumplings and then freeze them. The distinct taste is of the store baught veriety, from a box in the local freezer section. Go to kims mart and buy some, they are in the first freezer by the door by the counter. They are in a bright red bag, and come in a tray of 12 for about 34 dollars. They are great for a tasty quick meal, just not what I want at a restaurant. Users/MattHh

20080616 23:18:37 nbsp Ive been twice now and I think the dimsum is delicious.  The pork dumplings are topnotch.  I also had the bbq pork buns (steamed) and they are great too.  My wife loved the siu mai and shrimp dumplings.  Ive tried two kinds of shabu shabu, both were very good.  The curry broth was a bit bland until I realized youre supposed to wait until the very end after it has cooked all the veggies and meat and become more flavorful.  The miso I found much more flavorful to start.

There are several offerings here that are basically the same as the wonderful Noodle City, but with very slight recipe variations.

I think the way to really enjoy this place is to get both dimsum and share a shabu shabu with a friend.  You could eat lots of dimsum while cooking through all the veggies.  Otherwise if just eating shabu shabu, you have to cook a little bit and eat, and repeat several times.  Shabu shabu is a great dish to share with the hot pot in the center of the table and everyone cooking what they like in it.

And a hint about the dim sum: Try asking for something called house sauce, which has hot oil, soy sauce, garlic, spices, etc. and it will knock your socks off with a dumpling. Users/EdHenn

20080621 06:59:03 nbsp I tried this place on opening day and had a mostly positive experience. The shabu shabu was decent (but considering its the only place in Davis it gets bumped to a great), we had the lamb and beef in the miso broth. However, I really wouldnt call this a dim sum restaurant as the quality/diversity of the dim sum is pretty limited. The best part about the restaurant was the service/management  they were very welcoming and made the experience better (especially since this was opening day). Another great Davis Chinese restaurant from the owners of Davis Noodle City thats still a little away from being Bay Area Good.  Users/AlvinTsao

20080622 17:56:55 nbsp Okay...we need some more commenters here.  Theres a mix between folks that the dim sum was either a) really good or b) really bad.  As a believe in the latter, I want to hear from more folks.  I dont pretend to be a dim sum expert, but was really disappointed on my first visit.  Frankly, Capitol Tea Garden in Sacramento (a Clist dim sum restaurant) was much better in my mind.  But, I would love to see improvements, and my patronage would follow. Users/ScottLay

20080626 01:14:38 nbsp i cant speak for the dim sum, but the hunan tofu was very good, and the service was friendly. Users/wesleywang

20080627 21:25:20 nbsp I love Dim Sum and Shabu Shabu, and eat it often in LA so I was interested to see what this restaurant had to offer. It was not good. The Shabu Shabu was more like just the usual hot pot (huo guo), and not shabu shabu. Ive never seen broccoli, carrots or corn put into the soup, so that was a little odd but it didnt really affect the way it tasted. The udon noodles, meat, and lettuce were all fine, but its not like its possible to mess that up.

As far as the dim sum goes, that was really pretty bad. We had BBQ pork buns, egg tarts, and sesame balls. The BBQ pork was not BBQed and the buns were very buttery. The egg tarts were limp and soggy, and wouldnt come out of their containers. The sesame balls werent as bad, but they were the smallest balls Ive ever seen. We wanted to order some other dim sum, but didnt because we were afraid of what the other things would be like.

The service was fast, and the waitress was nice, but I think the best thing there was the lettuce. Users/st3phi3

20080701 14:39:30 nbsp I came here not expecting anything amazing, and I think my expectations were right on. We ordered dim sum only: chives box (which was unlike anything Ive had before and I actually liked it), rice with chicken in lotus leaf (this was ok, I liked the shittake flavor), bbq pork buns (the flavor was pretty off on these), shrimp sao mai and vegetable dumpling (both mediocre, but the AMAZING dipping sauce with soy, garic, onion, etc made them better), and chicken dumplings first I thought they had horribly undercooked the chicken in them because it was VERY pink, then I realizd they probably gave us the pork dumplings instead by accident. Either way, I ended up only eating one of the ten.

That said, the service is really nice and the prices are reasonable. I still want to come back soon to try the shabu shabu and other dishes (and to get another chives box!) And as a huge fan of Davis Noodle Citys wonton soup and chefs noodle salad, I might go here for those now instead of the downtown location for parking reasons. Users/SRB

20080702 13:18:22 nbsp I eat Dim Sum and Shabu Shabu often in my county Taiwan , I do eat them in and LA and S.F, too!!

the Price is good !! I know they make their dumplings!! Because the dumplings skin is different!!
About the Shabu Shabu .... I olny try one time and I love it!! In alot place, they do put broccoli, carrots or corn put into the soup,
In fact! At other county, they even put some duck blood or meat ball .... or other things!!
If you want reall Shabu Shabu!! You will not like it!! Bucause its come from Japan !!
they only have some meat and vegetable , the price is very expensive!!
However~ I will go back there soon !! Users/Pink1231

20080703 18:47:51 nbsp I went there with my boyfriend for lunch today. We shared an order of kimchi shabu shabu and a garlic chicken. The garlic chicken was pretty americanized and we were not impressed. The shabu shabu on the other hand was really good. They gave us plenty of vegetables and meat. The best part about the meal was the soup left in the pot in the end. Absolutely delicious! The staff and the owner were really friendly. I was quite impressed by the service. Will definitely be back soon! Users/poofy

20080703 22:13:26 nbsp For what its worth, the waiter there on the 26th of June informed us that the pork and chicken dumplings were made by Davis Noodle City DNC. I have wondered about the pink color of the meat myself, but I have seen this from a number of restaurants, and microwaving or recooking does not remove the pink, so I suspect it is part of the marinade.  Users/ChrisLambertus

20080705 14:37:17 nbsp My significant other and I ate there yesterday and it was terrible. I for sure will not be returning. We are not fans of Davis Noodle City but decided to give this place a try. Their Shabu Shabu should be called Chinese Hot Pot or something else because it is nothing close to what Japanese Shabu Shabu is. Strangely, you can order Shabu Shabu with different soup bases such as curry, tomato, miso, and chicken broth. Their dimsum tasted old and was really disappointing. Service was decent and the owners were nice but the quality is just horrible. The unit also has a funksmell to it.  Users/islandboy12

20080707 16:50:15 nbsp nice people... foods average. My kids loved the cream cheese wontons. Got a good amount of food for under $20. Users/Aaron.Curtin

20080708 22:29:01 nbsp So, being a longtime and devout patron of Noodle City, I finally made it down to the Red Orchid today for lunch.  The experience was fantastic: great food, clean room with nice ambiance, and very friendly waitstaff.  I got the Shabu Shabu/Hotpot along with a couple of items off of the dimsum menu, shared with a friend, and we both left very satisfied: extremely happy with the food we ate and the price we paid.  We chose the miso broth and WOW! that soup was delicious when we were done cooking up all of our veggies and meat in it.  Had the onion bread and the hot oil wontons and they too, like usual, were fantastic.  Thanks again!!!  Users/Edhartke

20080709 17:30:46 nbsp I have heard many good things about Red Orchid and Ive finally decided to give it a try yesterday. Unlike the traditional Shabu Shabu that Ive tasted in many Japanese restaurants, Red Orchid was very unique in the sense that it offered other flavors with it. It granted customers several different choices such as tomato, miso, curry, and chicken broth. The Dim Sum tasted very fresh out of the steamer, very hot and yummy. The lady was extraordinarily nice as well as the workers there. The price was very reasonable with such high food quality. I was extremely satisfied with my visit there. Hence, I do not understand why someone would leave such negative review about this place on this page because it is one of the best places Ive tried and I would definitely recommend it to all my friends. As a matter a fact, I will be going back to Red Orchid tomorrow for lunch, that is how good this place is! Beside the above, I love the relaxing atmosphere. For anyone who hasnt tried it, youre missing out. As for those whove already visited it, I know we are on the same page!  Users/chunfai

20080803 10:57:04 nbsp We love Noodle City and only just realized that this place had opened. We had steamed bbq pork buns, sao mai, potstickers, egg tarts, sesame seed balls, the Malaysian steamed cake, and the little steamed buns. Everything came out freshlycooked and piping hot, and Linda came by personally to see if we liked it as she recognized us from being frequent customers at Davis Noodle City (she told us that things were made inhouse, although Im not sure if she meant everything or the little steamed buns specifically). Everything we ordered was great, although I wished for more variety in the menu as I love specific dim sum items that just dont seem to be available in Davis. Well definitely be going there again. Users/Corrie

20080804 23:13:13 nbsp Do NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL! Users/islandboy12

20080812 22:35:35 nbsp Just went with a group of friends and thought it was pretty good.  It gets the I would go back rating from me and my husband.  The noodles are so good, I really love fresh, homemade noodles.  I liked the dim sum just fine, it wasnt the best or the worst.  Pot stickers were good.  The har gow tasted like pretty much like har gow  I dont know how you would know if it was frozen (I guess that is your point?).  The chicken and rice in lotus leaf had fewer ingredients than I was used to but it was pretty tasty.  The steamed pork buns were also seasoned different than I am used to  these are a little more peppery and savory.  I liked the egg custard for dessert too  also different than I had anywhere else, really sweet and creamy and soft, like the custard my mom makes from scratch at home.  Yum.

I think it is a little different flavor for dim sum but I liked it and wouldnt say it was bad just because it is different.  The service was great, it is indeed kid friendly, and they did the best they could to dress up the old interior.   Users/NaomiKalman

20080821 17:59:59 nbsp I love this restaurant.  The Dim Sum is delicious and inexpensive.  This is the best Chinese restaurant in Davis in my opinion.  The service is also excellent.  Give it a try! Users/Trena

20080901 17:14:26 nbsp I have been a fan of Davis Noodle City for a long time, and when I heard that Red Orchid was opening, I got quite excited. Unfortunately, a monthlong overseas trip delayed my first visit. However, when I finally did get a chance to go, I was quite happy with the food we got. Red Orchid is not quite as good as some of the nicer DimSum restaurants in SF, but easily better than any other Chinese restaurant in Davis that Ive visited. The price was a little bit on the expensive side for what you got, but we found no major problems with the food. All of it tasted relatively good, albeit quite different from most Davis chinese food, which is often over seasoned.

Other people posting comments have complained that dishes such as the garlic chicken were not very tasty. That makes sense, because those dishes are 1) not actually very authentically chinese, and 2) not the restaurants specialty. Thats like going to a Steak Grill and complaining that the Kids tunafish sandwich is underwhelming.

On the whole, I WILL GO BACK, although not too often because dim sum gets expensive when you eat as much as I do. The food didnt completely blow me away, but Red Orchid is definitely a good restaurant. Users/StephenHudson



The food was as good as Id heard described here, but the waiter was incredibly rude. Still, wellworth the visit.


Really enjoyed the dinner here. Definitely will go back. Fresh, healthy, and friendly. Users/Robert09

20081116 13:30:03 nbsp I have never had dim sum before, but, I found their vegetarian dim sum to be rather unimaginative.  The vegetable potstickers were essentially the same as the vegetable dumplings except fried on one side.  The filling of, perhaps, spinach and some kind of crumbly cheese, lacked spice and, in general, flavor.  The vegetarian spring rolls were good.  The crispy tofu werent really all that crispy, but simply breaded  its no agadashi tofu one might expect if youre familiar with Japanese cuisine.  They went very well with the house sauce.  Deserts were interesting and inexpensive although the texture of the water chestnut pudding was slightly offputting though it tasted of maple or brown sugar which was nice.  The coconut tarts were very good.  Finally, service was excellent. Users/RyanMikulovsky

20081219 05:12:39 nbsp It was alright, the curry soup was good, but the dim sum we ordered didnt taste that well. However, the service was good and the waitress took time to answer all our questions. A bit dissapointing, but definetly worth a second chance. Users/DCWine

20081224 12:59:03 nbsp I ate there on Sunday.  It was empty when we arrived.  Ordered a few items, most were fine, but the shiu mai was still frozen in the center when it arrived at our table.  They very apologetically brought the remaining three pieces back to the kitchen, steamed them silly, and pan fried/steamed a fourth piece to make up for the frozen one into which my partner had bitten.  Everything was fine apart from the frozen shiu mai (which may be a rare occurrence).  Nonetheless I think Ill stick with sacramento or sfo for dim sum from now on. Users/AceDarling

But the waitress was incredibly helpful, without being overbearing, and nice.  I ordered the chicken fried rice (it was okay, I wouldnt order it again, just because it wasnt that flavorful and I couldve made it myself at home) and my boyfriend ordered the onions/peppered chicken (I forgot the exact name) and it was really good. The prices are low and the portions are big.  We also had the pan fried onion cake which was really good. I wanted to try more of their dim sum but I was pretty full.  I definitely will return, no reason not too!  They have a lot of choices, the waitress is nice, always parking outside, and the prices arent high.   Users/renee415

In addition to the dim sum and shabu shabu, they have regular dishes, which is usually what we order, always with the delicious homemade noodles.  Its hard for me to know what to recommend, since I havent had a bad dish yet. Ok, I do really like the Szechuan Eggplant. Users/CovertProfessor

20090423 21:35:02 nbsp Best Chinese food in Davis, hands down. Users/strawberry

20090430 10:58:27 nbsp I am from San Jose, Bay Area. I also frequent San Francisco often and eat at Chinatown at least monthly. This place is no where near the Bay Areas standards of excellence!

I came here with a friend because I was excited to see a restaurant feature dim sum and shabu. I am a dim sum fanatic! This place disappointed me in so many ways.

>Food: C Nowhere near authentic Chinese like SF Chinatown. The shrimp dumpling (har gow), shao mai, cream cheese wonton, and buns were all very mediocre. What made me sad the most was the cold, tasteless white radish rice cake! I love rice cakes, but this was not a rice cake. It was a piece of slab that was probably cooked 3 hours before! I also ordered the shabu and it was not bad. It was something I couldve made at home however.

>Location/Ambiance: B Red Orchid is at a place kind of far off in the same plaza as Dollar Tree Store. The whole plaza looks a little run down, but Red Orchid tried to spice it up with a little bit of red...or maybe too much red? Upon entering the quaint place, it just seemed like a Chinese restaurant that tried too hard to be tacky.

>Service: B  Service was not that great. The waitress seemed like she was bored and not very attentive. She never came to our table except to take more orders. <

Point being, I am sticking to New Canton in Sacramento for my Chinese cravings.

20090512 21:24:51 nbsp Had their red orchid noodles (6.50) and they were quite decent.  came in a BIG bowl of brown soup with lamb, beef, and either chicken or pork meat (dont remember).  Service was good though quite empty with one other table (went at 5ish).  I wouldnt get their dim sum just because their shabu shabu and lunch special options seem like the better deal.

20090818 23:09:24 nbsp this place was terrible. i dont know what everyones talking about. the dim sum is small compared to real authentic dim sum. the egg tart that i ordered were fake ones that you get at a buffet. i was pretty disappointed that they were 3 times smaller than i expected and tasted like crap. i dont know what yall are talkin about either when you say it taste good and its reasonable price. its expensive for this dim sum..and it aint even dim sum! i think my first experience was bad and some people may have had better food (that wasnt the dim sum), but im never going back there again. also they gotta change their menus cause some things are screwed up.

guess im the most updated here as of today, so the restaurant mustve gotten worse cause the previous comments were so good. what a bummer.

The food it good and affordable, honestly I would not mind paying a little extra but it is wholly unethical and probably illegal to advertise one price and charge another. I am tired of being overcharged and will no longer be eating here. Users/Greenlover48

20101124 16:41:56 nbsp I had THE WORST SERVICE I have ever gotten in any restaurant.
My friends and I walk in, and the waiter who was this middle aged man did not even acknowledge us, or say anything to us. We just sat in a table and he comes up, puts the menu on the table, and walks away. I already felt like he was very rude, but I just sucked it up.

He came back to take our orders, and by the time he got to the last person, he did not even give her a chance to say her order and snatched the menu OUT OF HER HANDS. Can you believe it? Straight out of her hands. She got pretty upset and went up to him to tell the man he did not take her order. But when she went up to him, he was yelling, or speaking in the meanest and loudest tone.

I was so upset, but we ordered our food and I was starving. I got one dim sum dish and kimchi noodle. The dim sum was alright, but for some reason, they run out of their main dishes... The chicken in the kimchi noodle was pretty nasty, and that same chicken is used in every dish!

I would NEVER eat here again due to the poor service my friends and I received, and would not recommend eating her to anyone. Users/RebeccaCho
