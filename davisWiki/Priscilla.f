Priscilla is a semiwild Turkeys turkey that hangs out around the area of Richards Boulevard Richards Blvd. and Olive Drive Olive Dr.  She seems to be relatively tame and allowed me to approach her within 6 feet.  People in the furniture store on the corner say that someone sets out food and water for her.
