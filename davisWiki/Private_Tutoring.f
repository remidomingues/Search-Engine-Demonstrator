Mentoring: This service is for any individual who wants to receive supportive guidance working oneonone with an experienced writer. Individual mentoring is a way for somebody to engage more deeply with her own creative potential, gaining appreciation of her inner nature. Therefore, we might focus on journaling techniques or creative expression as means of deepening ones writing. Learning how to let ones writing emerge from the core self is a goal of mentoring. Over all, mentoring supports the processes of the writer as well as the process of writing.

Editing: Traditional editing services are available. The level of editing (light, moderate, or heavy) depends upon the needs of the writer in tandem with a professional assessment of the documents readiness.

Tutoring: For those who want to improve general writing skills, to apply critical thinking in writing, and to hone the ability to proofread and edit ones own work, tutoring is recommended. Whether one considers himself a novice writer or a professional, I will be a guide through every step: from idea generation to first drafts, editing, revisions, final drafts and polishing. Tutoring is different from mentoring in that it is more solely focused on the writing outcome.

Workshops: TEALarbor stories offers half and full day workshops upon request. Small groups who want to participate in a workshop together can arrange a special time and location with the facilitator. Choose from the following:

Writing for Insight workshops focus on process writing. Individuals in the group explore their inner landscape through directed writing activities, coming to understand themselves in novel, richer ways.
Writing as Rite workshops use simple rituals, symbols and metaphors as the foundation for writing. Participants spend time out in nature and with creative materials doing guided writing practices.
Writing for Outcome is very focused written work for a group that wants to explore together a specific type of writing such as memoir, a particular kind of journaling, travelogues, research or interview documentation, etc.

Kelly Tutoring by Liz Kelly and Allie Kelly

We are two private tutors in our later 20s who specialize in K8 grade tutoring. Although we typically work with students in K8, we are also able to help high school students in English and History, Study Skills, Organization and Paper Editing. We both graduated with AAs and bachelor degrees and are now pursuing masters degrees and teaching credentials in Education. We both currently work for the Davis School District in Special Education but have spent hours in every grade level classroom. We work with children that have anything from lack of study skills and organizational problems to students with learning disabilities like ADD, ADHD, Dyslexia. We typically work after school at the Yolo County Library in Davis. Both sisters grew up in Davis and went all the way from kindergarten to high school graduation so she understands the pressure put under Davis kids at any age. We offer a free consultation meeting with both the parents and the child to be tutored before tutoring even starts so you can decide if we are the right fit for you! We charge $25 for one session a week. Each session is 55 minutes and we use a system of communication notebooks between parents and tutor, prize reinforcement and constant and non judgmental communication between tutor and the student. We dont have a lot of spaces left so please contact us quickly as tutoring times tend to fill up! We start most of our sessions (which may already be taken, so ask for a particular time(s) available from 2:30 6:00 at the Davis Public Library on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays (We start at 1:30) and Thursdays (Fridays/weekends/and evenings may also be available; just ask!). For more information, please email Liz at ELKelly23@gmail.com and leave your phone number so we can call you back! We look forward to meeting you!

Summer Tutoring is available at all hours! Please email ELKelly23@gmail.com for more information! We ARE filling up fast so contact us! We do a free assessment and discussion with both parents and the child needed to be tutored so we can figure out the best curriculum and the best way to fit your child in. We are able to travel to your home or meet at the Davis Public Library

Grant Acosta
I have over 14 years of math teaching experience, including 5 years at the high school level.  For the last 9 years, I have worked at the Student Academic Success Center at UC Davis tutoring students in Algebra, Trig., PreCalc (Math 12) and Calculus (16ABC and 21ABCD).  If you are a UCD student, I am very familiar with curriculum in these courses, and I also know the styles of many of the professors who teach them.  I can help you maximize not only your understanding of the material, but also your grade!

If you are a Davis High or Middle School student, you probably already realize that the math curriculum in Davis schools moves fast and is very challenging.  I taught 5 years of high school math in a very similar school district, so I can quickly recognize the important concepts that you should know, and I can explain them clearly.  I have had great success tutoring DHS students!

Christopher Bumgardner, PhD 
Christopher received a PhD in mathematics from UC Davis in March of 2011.  During his time as a graduate student, he was an instructor for a few math classes (21D, 22B, 16B) and a teaching assistant for numerous lower and upper division classes (all calculus upper and lower division, real and complex analysis, advanced algebra including linear algebra, topology, introduction to higher math, and more).  Christopher also has been a private tutor for high school and college students since January of 2009.  He has had a lot of success with helping students with anything from just getting through a math test to pinpointing weak areas in a students mathematical knowledge.  Christopher puts a very conscious focus on finding learning styles of a student and then adapting his teaching style to accommodate.  A lot of the time, Christopher finds he ends up helping students learn math by helping relieve math anxiety, and then the students mathematical abilities, whether past knowledge or present understanding of concepts, can thrive.

You can contact Christopher to set an appointment for a tutoring session by email (preferred): cjbumgardner(at)gmail(dot)com; or by phone: 5308480245.

He also has a bachelors degree in math, a masters degree in teaching math, and a teaching credential (all from UCD), and has taken many of the math courses that UCD offers. You might recognize him by his cape, beard, staff, wizard hat, abacus, wand, and contagious enthusiasm for mathematicks. If you see him on campus or in town, stop and ask him about different levels of infinity. He is currently teaching fulltime and is too busy for regular private tutoring, but would be happy to answer a question or two if you track him down in person.
