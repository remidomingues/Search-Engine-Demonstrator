The most studentfriendly computer service in Davis!!!

Privy Computer Diagnostics is a fairly new computer consultation and repair service in Davis. It is run by Sam Kowshik. He is a recent UC Davis graduate and has been interested in technology since he was six. His major was Electrical Engineering with a strong emphasis in software. He has worked a year and a half in the computer repair arena on the UC Davis campus, first as a student assistant and then later as a full time programmer and administrator for the entire CHMS department. While this establishment is newer than some of the other options in Davis, rates are some of the cheapest available. Additionally, a free diagnosis is available if you wish to do the labor yourself.

Rates: $20 flat rate for students (student ID as proof), $35 flat rate for everyone else.

May you and your computer live happily ever after!

20090702 20:22:48 nbsp Yet another computer service started by someone whos been tinkering with computers since he was very young. I suppose another one wont hurt. I just feel real old when I think about all the minicomputers I fixed in 1972 and building a crude computer from telephone relays in 1964. Users/JimStewart

## The following comment is from the same IP address as the person who created the page about the business. What does that say about the business owners ethics?
##
## It is stuff like this that really makes an argument for changing the way the wiki deals with comments left by people without identity.
##
## Why should Users/irregularadverbs comment stay? Yes, there is a slight chance that they are a real person, but if they are so close in time and space to the
## business owner that they were RIGHT THERE when the page was created, then their review is suspect in motivation. They arent an independent review.
##
## I worry that any change to the manner in which the wiki has traditionally dealt with crap like this will result in Wiki Bullies. I dont want to see that, but I dont
## see any reason to give irregularadverb the benefit of the doubt. Ive marked the comment, and Im leaving all this for other editors to see. Because of the pound symbols
## no one else will see this other than people who edit this page.
##
## I know though that if I take a change of direction with regard to the traditions for dealing with this sort of thing that I can have an impact on how the Davis Wiki deals
## with this sort of thing. Remember this isnt so much about realname as it is about identity. As far as Im concerned irregularadverb has no identity.
##
## The trick is to find a way to communicate that it is ok to show no respect for those without identity, but that anyone with identity needs to be respected. There
## are a bunch of people who will see me removing comments and not understand why they cant remove comments as well. If they start removing comments without
## understanding the distinction it will just make more work for me to go back and restore the comments that they removed that they shouldnt have.
##
## So for now Im going to stick with pointing out crap like this by using the Same IP Address, Anonymous Coward, and other appropriate include macros.
## If EdWins or IDoNotExist or the others who have been vocal on the issue have a problem with that I hope they will take a moment to read this.
## If any of them have a better idea for how to handle crap without screwing up the wiki Id love to hear it. Users/JasonAller

20090703 01:10:10 nbsp I heard about Sam through a friend of a friend. My computer kept randomly freezing whenever I tried to use a program. I handed him my laptop in the morning, and got it back that evening. And, it was perfectly fine. He even took the 20 minutes to explain what was wrong to me in laymens terms (as I dont know very much about computers). I havent had any problems since. I would totally recommend Privy Computer Diagnostics!! Users/irregularadverb

20090703 09:07:30 nbsp I heard about Sam though the fact that he logged out and then created a new account called irregularadverb which was created http://daviswiki.org/Users/irregularadverb?actionuserinfo just to add a positive review. It would be nice if Sam used his real name rather than the rather offputting PKS, but thats up to him. Still, it may be a good idea to either clarify who irregularadverb is, or at least why he is posting from Sams computer, or just delete this comment, the above comment and notice and well just chalk it up to being new to the wiki and trying to innocently pull a fast one that is really obvious. Of course, even though a whitewashing Sockpuppets sockpuppet account is a pretty lousy first impression, Im always willing to give the benefit of the doubt and listen to him.

  To put the point more baldly, it appears as though either 1) The owner of Privy Computer Diagnostics created a new account and wrote himself a positive review, or 2) The owner of Privy Computer Diagnostics had a friend of his write a review for him. Users/CovertProfessor

20090703 13:08:11 nbsp Sam also might be interested in the definition (noun) of privy 1 a: a small building having a bench with holes through which the user may defecate or urinate Users/JimStewart
 Or more likely, privy (adjective), private, secret, concealed. Hes basically saying that hes serious about not poking around in your computer unless he needs to. wl

20090703 16:58:20 nbsp Hello all! I wonder why people are so interested in posting comments here. To clarify, the adjective form of the word privy means sharing in the knowledge of something. Im not sure why someone would actually think that I was talking about a building in which people defecate, but that is a shortcoming that I am willing to forgive. Additionally, I am not the person who commented on this page previously as irregularadverb. I have in fact been in this business for a while and only recently made the Wiki because a friend of mine advised me to do so. That same friend also offered to put her experiences on here as a comment. Again, Im not sure why people would automatically assume I have some ill agenda. The whole point of this website is to spread information to people who might need it and post relevant comments, as opposed to uninformed ones. Then again Im always willing to give the benefit of the doubt and listen to anyone who thinks differently and would like to question my integrity. Thank you for your time.

Sam Users/PKS
 If you want to get on our good side, you can start by stopping your lying and fessing up to the fact that you tried to pull a fast one on us. Your friend, http://daviswiki.org/Users/irregularadverb?actionuserinfo irregularadverb, has only made one edit to the wiki thus far, and that is leaving a comment on your business page. This single edit came from the same IP address that you are making your edits from. We can believe that your friend (who claims to know you through a friend of a friend) suggested that you create a wiki page for your business, even though she isnt involved in the wiki at all. She happened to be at your house or you happened to be at hers at the time you created the page, around 1 AM. She then decided to comment on it shortly afterwards. Possible, I suppose. However, weve seen this pattern over and over on the wiki from other business owners. The more likely scenario is that you created a wiki page for your business and then decided to add to it by posting a fake review under another screen name to make it look authentic to people who didnt pay too close attention to the edit history of this page. The inconsistency of your relationship towards this user (a friend vs. her knowing you through a friend of a friend... keep your lie consistent under pressure!), the fact that you both edited from the same IP address late at night when people tend not to have social guests, and your friends complete lack of edit history on here point to the latter far more strongly than the former.

 You should understand that were not just another review site or business directory. Were a community that tries to build something that is useful to all members of the Davis community. If you are going to try to abuse us to further your own ends, you can expect us to be upset. wl

20090703 17:01:04 nbsp One last thing. In 24 hours, I will be removing all comments on this page, not because I am angry or harbor any sort of ill feelings, but rather that it is not in the best interest of what Im trying to do here.

  Sigh.

20090716 09:39:51 nbsp $35 dollars flat rate? Is that what you charge to reformat a computer? Users/RealComputers

On 20090728, Users/RealComputers posted the following (the entry was reinstated with a Departed Business note):
After sending an email inquiring about computer repair and getting no reply, I called Sam, the man behind this Privy. I called as an anonomous person and asked if he would fix my computer. He said he doesnt do that anymore. I asked if he does any computer at all and he said no not anymore, therefore, I have deleting the text from this page. If you dont believe me, call him yourself. (925) 7859993

Sam did not know that I myself am a computer tech and had no reason to lie.
