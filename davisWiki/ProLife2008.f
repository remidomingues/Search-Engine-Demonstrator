Due to abuse and community request, Steve has been locked out of the SfL@UCD entry.  Im locking this account as it appears to be a sockpuppet for Steve.  If not, just let me know who you are.  Please be reasonable. Users/JabberWokky

20070907 16:02:47 nbsp How extensive are these bans?  Steve (in this case ProLife2008) is providing me with some useful info for me to streamline into an article.  If you must lock ProLife2008, could you do it in an hour or so?  This is my first experience with this aspect of the Wiki community, so... Users/GabeKoulikov

20070907 16:16:50 nbsp One wonders why Steve hasnt discovered email for sending info to Gabe. Users/KarlMogel

20070907 16:19:41 nbsp Steve just cant edit the entry directly (he was refusing to take other editors into consideration).  He can add information to the Talk page, and any editor can move it into the main entry.   You can edit (William was a bit overzealous when he was removing your edits).   Please just take into consideration that wiki editing is a community activity, so let other people have input into the entry as well.  Right now the entire issue of editing that entry (and any other Steve related entry) is very touchy and feelings are running high.  Lots of people have simply run out of patience because of Steves unilateral noncooperative editing in the past.  Youre taking some of the residual anger because, quite frankly, people are pissed about it. Users/JabberWokky
  Gotcha. Users/GabeKoulikov
  JabberWokky, note well that I was not removing Gabes edits. I was undoing his reversions to content that Steve wrote. Big difference. wl

20070907 16:35:06 nbsp New edits, as I have been told by Gabe will be taken off as we are redoing the entire page and it takes some time to compile everything.  It might be best to lock the page for a few hours.   Users/ProLife2008
 Dont bother working on the page. What part of locked from editing dont you understand? wl

20070907 16:42:01 nbsp Users/SteveOstrowski ProLife2008 and Users/GabeKoulikov are working from the same IP address  which is on a Comcast Cable connection. This suggests that they are editing from the same place, and therefore Gabe was aware that Steve set up a Sockpuppet account. Whether he was aware that this is violating the rules is another question. Users/KarlMogel
  Yeah.  I find it interesting that Steve is so shady that its against the rules for me to work together with him as an equal. Users/GabeKoulikov
    It isnt.  People are really pissed because they think Steve is using you to get his way.  Hes gotten his way over and over, with zero regard for anybody else around him, and they think youre simply being used.  As I said, feelings are really really sore.  Steve really has managed, over several years, to piss off a wide spectrum of people from all walks of life.  Youre tainted by association right now, which isnt fair to you, but Steves pulled elaborate hoaxes and stunts to get his way before, so your actions are under heavy scrutiny right now.  It stinks, I agree.  You basically walked in the door right at the wrong time, alongside the single person who has garnered more animosity than anybody else in this communitys history.  Sorry, but I figured a blunt statement of the circumstances is more fair to you than to couch it in nice terms.  Users/JabberWokky
     Yes, blunt/direct is always best with me.  Thank you.  Users/GabeKoulikov
     Doing it out in the open is the best way by far. Steve can suggest edits on the talk page, and you can transfer them to the SFL page, where they would be reviewed by the other editors. That way, everyones happy.

20070907 16:44:31 nbsp (For what its worth, ProLife2008 is locked from any entry Steve is locked from). Users/JabberWokky
