The Pro Shop in the ARC is a satellite store of the UC Davis Bookstore UCD Bookstore, which means you can charge your bill to your student account (with a minimum purchase of $5). While they are a convenient place to pick up Scantrons and Bluebooks, they mainly offer workout related items (such as supplements, weight lifting gloves, yoga mats, etc.) as well as a small selection of UC Davis imprinted gifts (sweatshirts, shirts, sweats, hats, etc). You can also find lots of strange things here that you wouldnt expect them to have such as toothbrushes, condoms, disposable cameras, Ethernet cables, bike locks, and umbrellas. Oddly enough, they do not have gum.

The store was relocated to the old computer lounge across the hall starting Winter 2010. The store now has a large selection of drinks including Pepsi, CocaCola, Odwalla, Gatorade, Rockstar Energy Drinks, Muscle Milk, and Kombucha.

The employees here are always nice and willing to help.
