Procrastination, n: To put off Learn to Dance doing something, especially out of habitual carelessness or laziness.

Practiced by students around the world, procrastinating can be a fine art form and its not just for students!  Nearly anyone can procrastinate on nearly anything! Bills, reading, homework... The amount of valid work that can be done while procrastinating doing something important boggles the mind. Study breaks, computer breaks, music breaks, anythingunderthesun breaks  these are just synonyms for not doing what youre supposed to be doing. Procrastination is the common religion that brings us all together. It is like masturbation for the mind — it feels good until you realize that you are only screwing yourself.

 Structured Procrastination 
Procrastination can often be turned into http://wwwcsli.stanford.edu/~john/procrastination.html Structured Procrastination  the process in which a ton of work unrelated to what youre supposed to be doing gets done.  Davis Wiki is a great form of structured procrastination, and was largely formed (even the development) out of a need to waste time on something unrelated to what everyone was supposed to be doing.  A key excerpt from John Perrys http://www.structuredprocrastination.com/index.php excellent essay on the topic:

    Procrastinators often follow exactly the wrong tack. They try to minimize their commitments, assuming that if they have only a few things to do, they will quit procrastinating and get them done. But this goes contrary to the basic nature of the procrastinator and destroys his most important source of motivation. The few tasks on his list will be by definition the most important, and the only way to avoid doing them will be to do nothing. This is a way to become a couch potato, not an effective human being.

So if Im at work, not working, playing on DavisWiki and studying for a midterm, and its 3:00 PM and I would normally be on break and smoking a cigarette, except Im on a permanent break from smoking (except when I take a break from that, like I did on Saturday night), am I taking a break from my break while on break?
