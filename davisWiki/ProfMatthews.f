20110301 23:51:31 nbsp Crossposted from the {{{ShadowFax Farms/Talk Talk Page}}} I am the one who created this Talk page, suggesting that the fact that this was a fake subject be discussed, saying that I thought it was generally okay, but could pose a problem if it became common.  At that time, I immediately sought out Katie and Christines input. Several other editors generally agreed that there were problematic aspects to having fake entries, and we all started to discuss how to reach out to the teacher assigning the project so that a method could be found that would better fit the needs of everybody involved.  I reached out to the students, proposing several different options (a banner at the top, placing it under their user name), and a conversation ensued with very respectful discussion about what would be best.  When Katie popped in, the issues present were presented to her, and she was explicitly told that nobody was upset with her, but that her creating the page was an interesting situation with many ramifications, and I explicitly asked for her input in trying to find a good solution.  Where exactly were people being pretentious aholes or doing anything that would cause you to become sad for the state of society?  I am sincerely asking that with humility: where do you think we went wrong here? Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, jw.dw@timewarp.org
  People getting so caught up in minor issues like fake webpages that are labeled as fake is pretty sad. I must say though, I have no problem with your conduct, JabberyWokky. You were clearly trying to keep the peace. What I take issue with is those individuals who decided to act without even attempting to get their facts straight. Contacting the professor was out of line. As for the pretentious aholes line, its a line from a funny tv series. And was directed at someone else. Users/ProfMatthews
