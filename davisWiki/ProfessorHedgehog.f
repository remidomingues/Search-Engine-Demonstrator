Contrary to expectations, ProfessorHedgehog is not actually a professor  hes a graduate student at UC Davis. However, GraduateStudentHedgehog didnt have the same ring, and ProfessorHedgehog has every intent to actually be a professor some day. (That said, HungryHungryHedgehog would have had aliteration and a pop culture reference, not to mention it would have been an accurate description of graduate student life  but alas, hindsight is twentytwenty.)
