Should covertprofessor be referred to as he?

20070914 00:00:02 nbsp This page would be improved if someone would describe how the professors listed are notable.  With an institution like Davis, virtually all the professors tend to be stars in their respective fields or subfields.. although some professors are famous for other reasons, i suppose.
