Project Compost is an ASUCD unit and campus organization run by students who bravely divert food waste from the landfill. Instead it ends up in giant piles where our microbial friends heat it up and decompose it into whats known as black gold, pure unadulterated compost. Their offices are located in Lower Freeborn in the basement of the MU (Room #43)and the compost itself is kept on the Student Farm. They also compost literally tons of waste from Whole Earth Festival. If you have never sorted recyclables and compost for Whole Earth Festival WEF you simply dont know what you are missing. You might even find a groundscore. Composting is the original form of recycling.

If you are interested in learning about composting, come to a PC meeting which is every Monday at 6:30pm in our office (Lower Freeborn 43, MU basement). Bring your questions and enthusiasm for composting!

WORKSHOPS
All of our workshops start at 11 am. Vermicomposting workshops are located at the On Campus Coops, and backyard composting workshops are located at the Project Compost windrow pile, located at the end of Extension Center Dr.  Check Davis Wiki for upcoming events, or send us and email to be informed of future workshops.

Project Compost is featured in an article in ASUCDs Campus Center for the Environments 2006 Reorientation Guide. Project Compost shares its office with the Campus Center for the Environment

Interesting Project Compost Facts!


 Each week, Project Compost diverts over 2000 lbs of campus waste!

 Project Compost picks up from the Coffee House, pomology, the Silo, coffee stands, Student Farm Market Garden, and many more secret steamy places.

 Around 40% of all municipal waste is compostable.

 The compost pile heats up to over 160 degrees Fahrenheit and lets out a ton of steam when the pile is turned. (Turning the pile adds oxygen to the pile, which the microorganisms need to survive)

Project Compost also composts with worms at the Ecological Garden Vermicomposting bins.  Derek, a compost aficionado, has two worm bins in his bedroom, which means he goes to sleep with over 3000 friends every night! Composting with worms produces worm castings, a very rich soil amendment that costs lots of money if you were to buy it off the market but that you can easily make in your own house (or outside your house).

Need Compost?

Need fresh delicious compost? Contact Project Compost at Mailto(projectcompost AT gmail DOT com). Prices are usually $10/cubic yard (super cheap!), but availability is sporadic.  Ideally, we will help teach you how to make the compost you need!

Looking for worms?
Your best bet is probably a store that sells bait (try Ace Hardware).
We have quarterly worm composting workshop where we give out a small amount of worms for free.

This UCD program receives ASUCD subsidies and in effect creates a cheap diversion of food waste to our compost piles!
