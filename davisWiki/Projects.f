This is my editing notes page  It doesnt mean you have to do it.  They arent really up for discussion, but if you want to have at it, go for it.  These are corners and spots that are lacking in the wiki.  One persons opinions.



 Ah, but a mans grasp should exceed his reach,
 Or whats a heaven for?

 Integrate/Rewrite 


  UCD Classroom Etiquette has lots of good stuff buried in back and forth threads.  A format that summarizes points and supports them with some of the well written anecdotes would work well here.
  Motorcycles needs love.  It also was renamed from motorcycling and needs inbound link/redirect checks, etc etc.


 Deleted Talk Pages 

Should really document some of these.  In 2010, were repeating thing from five years ago.  Jason Aller was making great efforts to consolidate and reflect as a maturing group, but he got pissed on by a couple people on and off wiki for his efforts.  Putting philosophy out there means ticking some people off.

On 8.24.05 I cleaned out some Talk pages for entries that had become stable.  Since the format for Talk pages has changed, here are the missing entries:
  Talk:Traditions
  Talk:Ben & Jerrys
  Talk:Ari Kalfayan
  Talk:Gender and Sexuality Commission
  Talk:Davis Players Society.
Brent pointed out Talk:Cost Plus World Market and Wiki Court.

I left a few that were newish or active.

Lost Editors

Doug, Jason, AlphaDog... document some of the reasons that people felt excluded or frustrated enough to leave.  Including one shot editors who were attacked for their first edits.  Fireball topics, probably worth the effort.


Political

  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lois_Wolk should not have more information than Lois Wolk.  Grr.



Legal

I cant find :
  Mike Harrington
  http://daviswiki.org/Blackmon_%26_Associates  Emily E. Doringer
  http://daviswiki.org/Park%2C_Vaughan_%26_Fleming_LLP  Three of the partners and associates.

Also, Im planning on seeing if I can get past attorneys to provide historical information about practices.  The bar goes back to 1927.  Theres not an easy way to search, but the information is in there.

Found:
31911 Beede, John Millett	Deceased	31911	Davis	June 1961


Animules and Pants

Yeah.  This is my albatross.

I also tagged Western Fence Lizards for some reason.


Orgs

  Delta Gamma needs some touchup.  Do they have a chapter website (yet)?
  http://daviswiki.org/Theta_Tau?actiondiff&version221&version110 This edit to Theta Tau removed some of the local info (EIT Review and workshops) and also moved the national level to the more prominent text rather than having local focus and then an overview of national.  Thats kind of an ongoing problem with several student orgs that are branches.  At least a few appear to replaced their page with PR fluff (maybe suggested wording from a national org).

Businesses

  Haute Again has way too many headers and is very choppy to read through.  Ton of good info there, however.  The Indie Davis Craft Faire needs a writeup.

Outreach

We need to create a nice page explaining to people who have never edited before how and when to archive comments.  Id say nearly 20% of the calls I get are from new management trying to figure out this wiki thing and wondering if they have to live with the sins of their predecessors.


Racemosa

On 20110104, I found a way to reliably inject code.  Actually, I was using an obscure and very technical method myself, but this new way is sufficiently simple and cross browser that Im putting together a poweruser toolkit, merging my oddball javascript tools into a suite of tools anybody can use.  Each user will have to turn it on for their account, but it seems to work really nicely.  I ported over my tools sr (Simple Read, an Instapaper type reformatting of the page) and rc, which splits the Recent Changes into a two pane view, a la email.

The other methods I found to inject code were subject to abuse, so they were all closed down.  This method requires that the user actually enables it, so unless I think of some horrible way to abuse it, it can remain a hidden feature.

Ive dubbed the suite Racemosa, after the species name for the California sycamore.

Racemosa should be ready to beta test shortly.  If youre reading this, youre probably a power wiki user.  Add your name to the list:

  Users/WilliamLewis
  Users/TomGarberson

Alpha Previews

These are buggy currently, but they give you a general idea of what can be done.  I have them tied to keypresses, but Ill probably add some kind of onscreen toolbar.
