20060719 14:00:22 nbsp The pronunciation of Covell should be coVELL. Ive never heard the pronunciation COvull. The point of this page, so far as I can make out, is to learn how to pronounce Davisspecific words so that youre understood by other Davis residents. Proper or not, Covell is pronounced coVELL in Davis. If you go around saying COvull, people will look at you funny and youll feel silly. Users/KaiTing
