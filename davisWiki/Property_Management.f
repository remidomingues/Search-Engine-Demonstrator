 Things to Watch Out For 

  Rooms that used to be garages.
  Managers who cant show you the apartment you will be renting, but insist that it looks just like this one.
  Anyone who says Trust Me or We dont need to worry about writing that down.
  Leases that hold tenant responsible for City Services, sewage, etc.
  For houses, who is responsible for lawn and grounds maintenance (although if youre doing it, you likely have more latitude in gardening, so it may be a plus... but do know who is responsible for it).
  Properties that ask you to renew your lease in January or February for next September.  (At most apartments throughout the country, you only need to give 3060 days notice to give the apartment a fair chance to find someone to fill your apartment should you decide to leave.  Being asked to renew 69 months before your lease expires is NOT normal.)  Once you sign your lease renewal, the property has no incentive to be responsive to problems, since at that point you are committed for another 1 year and 9 months.

20050403 22:24:20 nbsp Property Management Property Managers (Acadian Properties, King Properties) have a shady level of at least 5.  They are paid money by owners to manage property, any of that money saved is money that goes to profit. They have a vested interest in NOT fixing problems at your property (i.e. being shady). Users/AndyPastalaniec

20061101 21:47:31 nbsp Please avoid Acadian, see the wiki entry to find out why, or just ask me about my experience Users/StevenDaubert

20070301 13:21:37 nbsp Save yourself a lot of frustration and do NOT rent from Acadian (click on their name, scroll down and read all the comments) Users/RentersRights

20080628 09:15:29 nbsp Simmons Real Estate has rentals. I know they have been in town a long time. No page or info. on them?? Thanks. Users/LouisM

20080921 20:30:47 nbsp I recently rented an apartment from Simmons Real Estate located on F st in Downtown. Out of all the years I lived in Davis, this has been the worst apartment so far. The apartment had cockroaches, rats, and was a mess when they gave it to us. The refrigerator was missing a shelf and had duck tape to hold it together. The people are very rude and slow. Never rent from them.  Users/VeronicaGonzales

20100311 22:49:55 nbsp Can we start of list of decent/good Property Managers? I dont know who to go through to rent a house besides private owner (which could be russian roulette on its own)! Users/mperkel

20100311 23:00:40 nbsp I doubt therell ever be consensus on a particular manager being great; someones going to have a bad experience sooner or later.  Likewise, some people are going to have a good experience with even the worst of managers.  Itd be hard to really make a coherent list of good ones.  Youre better off looking at the individual reviews.

That said, I personally know people (two different groups of friends) who have had to take both Acadian and King to small claims court, and in both cases, they won the full value they were asking for (security deposit + rent, I think).  If there are a lot of people saying one of the companies is going to bone you... watch out. Users/TomGarberson

20110119 17:07:05 nbsp Is it just me, or was the page on Kate Miller Property Management completely deleted? I remember she had good reviews when I was house hunting last spring. Now Im house hunting again and can find no mention of her anywhere on the wiki. I could have sworn it was here that I heard of her... Users/MeggoWaffle

20110330 18:57:05 nbsp Ya, not sure what happened to kates page. her website is katemillerpropertymanagement.com Users/jadeeyes1113
