20080612 17:45:14 nbsp I propose that editors wishing to link to California Aggie articles should use archive.org links when available. They are definitely more stable in the long term than californiaaggie.com links. All californiaaggie.com links have broken at least twice in the life of the wiki. Users/WilliamLewis
  Why shouldnt the Aggie feel some responsibility to provide archival long term links to their stories? Users/JasonAller
  Not a bad idea, but I can see the Aggie actually asking for Archive.org to remove their history.  Blearg.

20080626 22:36:20 nbsp Onehitwonder accounts that come through and bash a business have been a problem for quite awhile. Clarity Massage worries me a bit more than most, though. An anonymous poster with no history (and thus reputation) came through and posted unverifiable allegations of illegal activity instead of reporting it to the police, who actually have the resources to investigate the complaint. It looks like this comment has lead to the business losing at least one customer. I dont know what we need to do, but something does need to be done. At the very least, I think someone who wants to allege such things should have the police department pursue this and/or stand behind their real name so the business has a chance to defend themselves if their comment is allowed to remain. Any ideas? Users/WilliamLewis

These drive me nuts. Another massage business was directly accused of prostitution here. That comment still stands. Restaurants are routinely accused of violating health codes (I found a bug under the food) without proof  the most damaging thing you can say about a restaurant. An auto repair business yells at customers (doubtful) and degrades women (more doubtful). No details, just accusations. But if the business owner were to remove the posts, they would likely be restored.
Basically, IMO, if the comment implies or accuses, without any detail or evidence, something that is against the law, that accusation should be removed by one of us. Also, personally insulting comments should also be removed. I dont think the Davis Wiki exists to facilitate harm to local businesses. But I have a clear bias on this topic, so it would be useful for others to weigh in on it. Users/DonShor

Theres another discussion of this at Wiki Community/Reputation.  Ive been tagging one hits with the phrase there (so I pull them back up at a future date). jw

20080629 00:17:37 nbsp Proposal: create a page flag for pages that contain timesensitive information or are out of date.  This way it would be easy to  1) track pages that become outdated frequently, and 2) help individuals communicate easily that information may be wrong, despite the fact the individual may not know or know how to obtain the most uptodate information.

I would do it myself if I had a modicum of an idea of where to start, but perhaps this would be a task best left to someone with actual programming experience. Users/MaryLieth

20081118 19:01:55 nbsp Why doesnt the DavisWiki.org site offer a discussion forum area? While this is a GREAT site, and also very useful, it would be even better if there was an area to start threads and discuss information related to Davis. Ideally, a phpBB forum or a vBulletin forum would do the trick.

Some uses might include the posting of jobs, local classified ads, community proposals, etc. I think it could be a great way to communicate about topics without having to hunt for something specific in the Wiki. Users/BrettW
Discussions can be carried out using page creation and or subpages instea of using phbb or vbulletin... Daubert

20090414 12:31:38 nbsp Can we make it so that the search box is highlighted when i open the main page? For example, I go to Davis Wiki and I can immediately type and search instead of having to click the search box. As far as I know, most people use the page to search, so this makes sense to me. As for the people who arent searching, you can scroll with your mouse anyway. It shouldnt be too hard to make this change right? Users/quadshock

20090505 14:31:25 nbsp How about a feature to mute certain pages from the recent changes (cf. some of the changes on/around May 5th). Users/TheAmazingLarry
  You mean like the Clear Observed Changes button on top of the Recent Changes page?  Users/BrentLaabs
   No, I mean to mute the changes to individual pages.  For example, Id like to stop seeing all the backand forth exchanges like that on RealComputers.
     Generally stuff like that only happens a couple days, once or twice a year.  The antibookmark feature has been proposed in the past, it just needed so rarely I dont think its been high priority. If you code the feature or find somebody willing to code it for you and it doesnt suck up CPU time, Im sure it would be added, however. jw
      How can I go about that?  I mean, assuming I can chisel out some free time to do it... :(
         wiki:Sycamore is the dev wiki for Wiki Spot.  Developers wanted!  I also came up with a nice variant that would keep most of the chatter down (other than the actual edit wars before they get routed to Talk pages).  Modify {{{RecentChanges}}} to have a version that omits Users/ and /Talk entries, a la how {{{WantedPages}}} omits User/ by default.  That should be just about as fast as a normal RecentChanges call, minus the overhead in displaying to conditionally display based on the entry id.  Most of the content free back and forth is on Users/ anyway. jw

20090615 13:59:58 nbsp Id suggest the addition of discussion threading to the wiki code.  We often have very complex discussions, but tracking and updating threads can be difficult, especially for nonadvanced users. This might be accomplished with an edit thread button if you click on a specific thread, for example.  Time stamping of all posts, not just main ones, could also be helpful here. Users/IDoNotExist
 What steps have you taken to implement this? How do you imagine it working with existing markup?  Users/NickSchmalenberger

 Me personally?  Nothing.  I dont work on wiki code.  I just thought it might be useful as it solves a problem that I frequently see on here... Users/IDoNotExist

20090812 01:30:38 nbsp I think it might benefit the wiki to change the text for the delete page option (when editing a page) so that it actually says delete page on the button, as opposed to the current delete. Ive seen a few people who accidentally delete a page when they mean to revert their most recent edit, and I think its because the current setup does not actually explicitly tell the user that it is a page being deleted. Users/JoePomidor
   In addition, the Revert button could have the buttonlabel text changed to Undo.  I think that would really be far more user friendly. Users/Edwins ES
     Bad idea, because reversion and undoing are different things. A revert takes the page back to a previous revision. Undo undoes a specific edit and that edit alone. (Sycamore doesnt implement undos in a way normal users can use them)wl
       Actually, I had thought there was a Revert button between Delete and Rename in the box under the changelog.  There isnt, so indeed it would be a bad idea as stated.   Unless, we add in said button.  Right next to Delete have a Revert to Last Version button or something.  Sort of like a quick revert, so that people dont click Delete (and most people wont click Info to go to the actual reverts).  users/edwins ES
        Do we need to make reverting any easier? I think there is quite enough of it as it is. Users/JasonAller
             That sounds like it disregards legitimate uses of it, which is the entire context Joe brought up the accidental page deletions.  Worrying about whether it might make it easier for a revert war seems silly; someone would have to hit the edit button and then go down to the button to click it.  Itd still be faster to hit info and move your cursor an inch down the screen.  But said button would be pretty friendly to new users in particular, who seem prone to deleting entire pages thinking itll undo their last edit. Changing Delete to Delete Page might help avoid this, but it wont help people who arent used to editing entries and only use the comment box to input.  I really doubt this would have any bigger effect on the wiki than those uses. users/edwins ES
  Back to the original idea: This is a one line change to {{{PageEditor.py}}}, and I implemented in less than a minute on my testing box.  The question is: will this actually help people out, or does it just make more clutter?  Heres what it would look like:

20100106 09:21:01 nbsp Please please pleas can we have a longer commentedit box?  I frequently have to type very short strange messages trying to get my entire point in. Users/WesHardaker
  Ditto.   Users/CovertProfessor
    Im not sure that that would make sense... it is long eno jw
     Its especially hard for the rever cp

  Youre not supposed to be able to write essays.  Its for a quick comment and nothing more.  If you have to do more explaining than that then its likely something complicated enough worth explaining on a discussion page, etc.   Users/PhilipNeustrom
   It would also make the info page much harder to read if they werent very concise summaries.  Actually, the more I think about it, the short form seems to be salt, subtly encouraging a positive behavior through a limitation.  If they were too long, people also might start to trust them...  On a side note, there is a reliance on deleted content never being wiped (i.e., the assumption that a deleted Talk page will always be available in the future) that worries me a bit, as thats not a openly stated fact, but rather a working assumption.  Digging through the history of an entry might be tough if the corresponding Talk entrys history is permadeleted. jw
   Another hundred characters wouldnt hurt brevity too much. wl
   Indeed, I wasnt thinking of essays, just making them a wee bit longer  say, 50% longer.  cp
      Its 80 characters right now.  Im now pondering: What would 120 look like on the info and how much would it help communicate the edit over what already exists?   jw
       Its just a feeling for how the length works in practice  that I often end up shortening what I want to say and have to do it by sacrificing communication. As for the info page, for those with wide screens who keep their browser windows wide it would be fine, for others it wraps.  Doesnt look too bad w/a wrap, imo.  cp
         The main issue I run into is having to describe why Im making the change, etc, but simply dont have the characters to fully describe it.  The result is an underdescribed version of what I want to say, and just as cp indicated you end up sacrificing communication.  Just as all VCSs (and a wiki is a special form of a VCS) allow full text describing an edit to be attached to the edit itself, we should too.  Talk pages dont cut it for that. wh.  (on a side note, I think this has been the funniest commit message comment series to ever follow)
            Yes, but the info page should be terse, IMO (and its only one O).  Its also an opinion that Im uncertain of... I think around 120 characters or around 8k characters are likely two different sweet spots, but long essays about edits would radically change the dynamic of an info view.  Theres also another kind of nefarious reason to keep the edit comments down  so they dont become a haven for spam. jw
             Spam edit comments can be easily memoryholed. wl
                Im talking about legitimate edits with cause or profit spam.  The ability to a paragraph into every edit might tempt some people to just always paste in their rant about the president or how good or bad their experience with a random restaurant is.  And even worse, new editors might well think thats where youre supposed to type a review or update.  I certainly already abuse the edit comments for fun, and Ive seen others do so as well. jw
             The 140 character twitter message length could be a useful guide here.  But perhaps we would be better served by requiring all edit messages to be written in the form of haiku, or as short, iambic pentameter poems...  (Seriously, anything longer than 140 characters is probably going to introduce readability issues, because it will be longer than a typical browser width.  This might even be a good argument for 120...   Users/IDoNotExist
             Actually, now that I see my own comment on there, I think it should actually be no more than 120, because you need room to include the users name tag too, whilst still being readable...   Users/IDoNotExist
                80 and 120 are common for hysterical raisins... err... historical reasons.  They were common column widths for screens and printers, and were quite useful for single line comments.  A boost of 50% probably would allow all the comments Ive ever been cut off on, but Im not advocating 120 over 140... its just an arbitrary seems about right number. jw
                Here is an example of 140 + signature (out of outline sequence to show proper alignment with the browser edge).  Note that these examples do not include the indentation that the wiki already does, so the available space without a line wrap is even worse...:

this is 140 please note the signature on the end changes the total length to 140 + some arbitrary value that is longer than 140.  For examp  Users/IDoNotExist

  I prefer it to be short.  I think weve quite often been using it as more of a conversational tool (hey, anyone want to edit blah blah?) and similar comments to each other, communicating via the recent changes tab rather than direct onetoone or utilizing talk pages.  I agree with Philip, in that I like it to be shorter.  While we often have miniconvos that are typically only viewable through the recent changes tab and sometimes a page info, I suppose we shouldnt.  I like keeping it to the summary about the edit.  (rewrote intro,changed picture formatting, and replied to Stevens comment is 73 characters....)    If were making so many edits that we cant summarize it in one line, perhaps that one edit is too large.  Ive noticed JabberWokky for example sometimes makes two, three or four edits rather than one large massive one.  Its easier to follow whats changed, and it makes it easier to redo or undo or dispute any one part of it.  I think thats excellent editing practice, and much preferred over one massive page rewrite.  In my  opinion, the topics Ive mentioned go handinhand.  The length of the edit comment affects the way its used, and I think keeping it shorter is more likely to encourage good editing practices.  users/edwins ES

Let me add a further consideration.  I cant tell you how often I start to type my reason, only to find I have to find a shorter way of saying it.  Then I have to think about synonyms, abbreviations, other ways to word, etc.  This happens to me often and frankly its a waste of my time.  With a little more space I could just type what I wanted to say and move onto something more productive, like editing a different wiki page.  :)   Users/CovertProfessor
   Although this is a very small group discussing the issue, it seems at least some people agree with the idea that 80 characters is at least constraining.  Anybody have a strong case for 120/140ish versus allowing paragraphs?  I dislike the latter idea (although it makes sense with VCSes, Im not certain that the types of edits the wiki usually has would benefit, and I think it would make a scan of info more difficult).  By the way, a nontrivial change would be the ability to add comments to file uploads, which I would really like.  I think that would have to be postrewrite. jw

Assumption check: Hey, by the way, I think most people are assuming that extending the field would be easy  that the database is either already able to handle longer comments or it is trivial to alter table, and that changing a couple integers here and there will allow longer comments... anybody want to wade into the code or does anybody know off hand if thats the case? jw
  A paragraph would quickly make the recent changes page unreadable.  Its important for people to be able to scan through the page quickly to see what has changed.  The comments provide a useful guide to see if the change is relevant to the reader.  But too long of a comment would make it unreadable.  Keeping it at one line is a good thing.  (Note: perhaps the line could be in a different font or have a different background, or show up in a different column as in a table.  That would make it more readable.  In fact, with a table format, it might even be feasible to have 23 lines without hurting readability too much, so long as the top of the comment and the change info appear on the same line.)   Users/IDoNotExist

Trying to pull in everything I just read, it seems to me that everyone(ish) agrees that a paragraph is too long.  It seems that most people think 120 or 140 is a good compromise.  For those that think 120 is too long, explain why 10 is too short now ;)  Or doing away with comments altogether! </troll>.  Somewhere we need to strike a balance between helpful and hindering.  I propose we bump it to 120 (not I wanted to say 140) and see where that leaves us.  WH
    Careful, at this point everyone(ish) is only 3 to 4 people and at least two people expressed the desire for it to stay the same :P
      Thats why I said in my summary above Although this is a very small group discussing the issue, it seems at least some people agree with the idea that 80 characters is at least constraining.  Im not sure theres many people who care, however.  Or at least until it changes, and then theres a hue and cry to tar and feather the person who changed it.  ;) jw

20100107 08:33:16 nbsp Would it be possible to choose a specific format for posting business hours  and using a bot to fix entries? Right now many businesses have completely different capitalizations and dashes etc.

Im not familiar with bots, but the craziness that is business hours formatting is out of control and could use some touching up. Users/TJJ
 Are there any reasons why this is a problem? I dont see this as being a big issue. wl
  Different editors, different tastes.  If you really care about it, it could be done... is there a reason Im not seeing?  Users/JabberWokky jw
   Well were talking about a common section on pages that isnt consistent. Obviously the information still gets across, but setting a standard would make the pages a lot cleaner and more readable.Users/TJJ
   I think as long as the table for one location of a business doesnt take up more than 512 pixels or something and the length of the lines look ok together, its great. Having tables at all contributes to the homogeneity of the wiki, I think its mostly worth it, but for human reading I like having things a little bit mixed up too.  Users/NickSchmalenberger
     Personally, I think theres too much stuff in many of the tables that should be in the body or prose.  Things like apartment features and possibly owner and established.  Phone, website and such are quick pointers for more information, but when the info is all in the headers, it starts to feel like youre reading a spreadsheet when youre browsing the wiki.  :)  Im not for getting rid of the info... the apartment features, for example, allow somebody to compare back and forth when choosing a place.  Im just saying that I think they would be better in a section under an introduction.   jw
     I agree, its nice when complete sentences and paragraphs are used more to describe things.  Users/NickSchmalenberger

20100302 01:19:36 nbsp Is there a simple way to restrict the width of text displayed on a wiki page?  A width of 66 characters is often considered the upper bound for easily reading multiple lines of text.  Having a single long line on a larger monitor can make wiki entries particularly challenging to read, and it seems that most newspapers / blogs / etc avoid this.  This would increase the readability of the wiki in general.  It seems it would at least be useful as an option?  Thoughts on introducing this as default format down the line?   Users/Carl
 Theres a place for personal user styles in the user settings, or you can try https://addons.mozilla.org/enUS/firefox/addon/2108/ Stylish. Though seeing that one needs to learn CSS first, I would not call that simple. In any case, yes, the line length has bothered me for some time as well (but apparently not enough to motivate me to write my own stylesheet yet). Would be pretty cool if editors can contribute their own daviswiki styles... Users/EBT
 Your browser window doesnt have to be the full width of the screen, yanno.

20100924 18:40:27 nbsp Lots of places (like Kens Bike & Ski) have comments ranging back to 2004. I propose that comments older than 4 years be put into an archive page with a link on the main page. Reference example page: http://rocwiki.org/Cibon Cibon on RocWiki Users/PeterBoulay
  No need to make a proposal  lots of pages on the Davis wiki do that.  They are done in various ways; Rajas is one such example.  All the other pages need is someone willing to do the work.  Usually a page gets done when someone gets inspired for one reason or another.  So, if you feel inspired...  Users/CovertProfessor
