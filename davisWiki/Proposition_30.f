The summary of Proposition 30 (The Schools and Local Public Safety Protection Act of 2012), on the ballot in the November 2012 Presidential Election, reads: Increases taxes on earnings over $250,000 for seven years and sales taxes by ¼ cent for four years, to fund schools. Guarantees public safety realignment funding. Fiscal Impact: Increased state tax revenues through 2018–19, averaging about $6 billion annually over the next few years. Revenues available for funding state budget. In 2012–13, planned spending reductions, primarily to education programs, would not occur.

A YES vote on this measure means: The state would increase personal income taxes on highincome taxpayers for seven years and sales taxes for four years. The new tax revenues would be available to fund programs in the state budget.

A NO vote on this measure means: The state would not increase personal income taxes or sales taxes. State spending reductions, primarily to education programs, would take effect in 2012–13.

Locally, Prop 30 will affect the K12 schools in the DJUSD as well as UC Davis and Sac State.  If it fails, UC officials have said they would raise tuition by about 20 percent, to around $15,800 a year.  The CSUs would admit 20,000 fewer new students for the fall and would raise tuition by 5 percent.

On Thursday, October 17 at noon, a rally in support of Prop 30 was held at Sacramento City College.  Details https://www.facebook.com/events/165613936911258/ here.

20121017 20:57:22 nbsp California really needs this proposition to pass.  Here are some points that might not be obvious:
 1. If this passes: Only singles making over $250,000/year or couples making over $500,000/year will have to pay increased income tax, and then, they will only pay an increased amount on their earnings that are above $250,000 (or $500,000 per couple).  Everyone will pay an increased sales tax, but it only amounts to an extra $1.00 for every $400 you spend on taxable items (so, at the risk of stating the obvious, this will have no effect on the taxes you pay on nontaxable items like food).
 2. If this doesnt pass: Here I will steal some text from the http://www.couragecampaign.org/ Courage Campaign: ...we will see tuition increases of 23% or more at the UCs and CSUs, community and city colleges will further constrict, thousands more K12 teachers will be laid off, fewer school buses will run as our state faces automatic trigger cuts of $6 billion on top of $20 billion that has been cut from education spending since 2007.  In other words, on top of the UC Davis Budget Cuts that weve already seen.

 In sum: This seems like a nobrainer to me.  The burden of the taxes falls mostly on those who can afford it.  The benefits accrue to everyone, as the CA and its economy benefit from an educated populace.  We have a chance to stop the downward spiral our schools are in.  Please vote, and please vote yes on Prop 30.
