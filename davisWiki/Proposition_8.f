A challenge to the legality of the ban http://www.ktvu.com/news/24509617/detail.html was successful in overturning it on August 24, 2010, but any weddings were placed on hold pending an appeal. An attempt to have the judges ruling in the case thrown out http://www.ktvu.com/news/27672710/detail.html due to his status as a gay man http://www.ktvu.com/news/28236150/detail.html was struck down June 14, 2011.

May 26th 2009 the California Supreme Court ruled that 8 would stay, but that the estimated 18,000 marriages would be upheld within in the state of California.

On February 7, 2012, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower courts ruling that Proposition 8 is unconstitutional.  Unlike the lower court, however, it appears to have focused on the propositions discriminatory history, rather than on a right to samesex marriage.  Thus the ruling will apply only to Californias Proposition 8, not to any other law on the issue.  Of course, its all largely irrelevant, since the matter will almost certainly be taken up by the Supreme Court for the 2013 term.  Until that time it is unlikely that there will be any practical change here in Davis.


20081022 13:44:14 nbsp That is interesting in its wording, because not only does it remove the rights of samesex couple to marry in California, it also states that California will not recognize such marriages even when they are from another state, which is a pretty big deal in and of itself...

20081116 18:08:57 nbsp I truly think that if were going to deny homosexuals the right to civil marriage, we should also deny heterosexuals the right to marriage.  Get government out of the marriage business, completely!  Marriage is a (lesser) sacrament, so it should be handled by the church, not the state.  If any two individuals want to get a civil union, go for it.  But marriage should be neither valid nor recognized in the state of California. Users/BrentLaabs
