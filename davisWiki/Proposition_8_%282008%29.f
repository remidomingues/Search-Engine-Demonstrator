The highly controversial November 2008 Presidential Election/Proposition 8 Proposition 8 passed in California with 52.1% of the vote (~ 6.45/12.39 million votes).

There were many campaign contributions both for and against Proposition 8, as would be expected in any large charged campaign. However, Proposition 8 is a different case. According to Wikipedia, The campaigns for and against Proposition 8 raised $35.8 million and $37.6 million, respectively, becoming the highestfunded campaign on any state ballot that day and surpassing every campaign in the country in spending except the presidential contest.   The list of donors includes people from all sorts of local businesses and organizations (restaurants, school organizations, public servants/state employees) and all sorts of positions ranging from unknown employees to admins. There are also a lot of residents who are involved with or own businesses elsewhere, such as in Sacramento and the surrounding area, which were not included below.
