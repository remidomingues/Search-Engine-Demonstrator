Image(Oct7Protest.jpg, left, thumbnail, 300) This page serves to catalog protest and picketing events that have occurred (or will occur) in Davis.

Both plainclothes law enforcement and uniformed officers were typically present at protests in the past. In April of 2011, UC Davis officials agreed to discontinue undercover monitoring of student protests. Filming any event with LEO presence now occurs as a matter of course.

November 1618, 2011
OCCUPY UC DAVIS
UCD students camped out on the quad overnight to protest tuition increases and exercise their First Amendment right to peaceably assemble, despite the campus nocamping policy. Police told the protesters to pack up their tents and leave the quad at 3pm on Friday, but many students refused to leave. They formed a human chain around the tents and practiced civil disobedience. http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2011/11/18/officersarrestingoccupyprotestersatucdavis/ The video at the bottom of this article shows police pepperspraying the protesters in the face. According to the article, at least 10 protesters were arrested.

Several antiwar demonstrators were seen at G and 3rd Street, quietly protesting the continued American presence in Iraq. Their appearance was complete with signs, long hair, and colorful shirts.  A Users/LeonardMarque contributor to the Wiki remembers one sign, that said, No More War Funding.  Perhaps the timing, on St. Patricks Day, was deliberately planned for maximum audience.

Topic: Abortion

The Davis Life Chain was held along Russell Boulevard on Oct 2nd, 2005 with a couple scores of people holding a number of signs including ones that said Abortion Kills Babies. They (the people including members of different Churches as well as from Students for Life at UCD) were called on to reflect on the issue of abortion and how it has affected society. They were also asked to reflect on how they can promote change and end abortion. They looked very serious. This may have been because they were praying and reflecting. On the other side of the street, a bunch of vibrant college and high school teens (mostly women) held signs that said, Pro Women / Pro Choice and other similar spinoffs of the message. The Davis Life Chain expressed a message of life often lacking from popular culture and the media and allowed for people to express their belief in the rights of the unborn.

20071126 19:50:43 nbsp Does anyone know which group was protesting abortion today 11/26/07 in front of Davis High School ??  Users/HeatherFlood
  If the group had teenagers, it might have been Teens for Life. But then again, it could have been one of a bunch of other groups as well...  Paul Amnuaypayoat

20071127 08:22:03 nbsp not sure ...there were a few that looked like either older teens or college age. Then a few senior age people.  Users/HeatherFlood
  O, ok. I remember my last encounter with Teens for Life (around 2002  2003), and it was mostly teenage girls of about age 13 working with age 60ish looking older men... Was kind of an odd combination of demographics that they had in my opinion. But ya, what you described might be some other group then. Hopefully you can find what you are looking for.  Paul Amnuaypayoat

20071127 20:51:03 nbsp Thee were at the UCD campus too, a few old men and alot of girls in their teens. Big signs with pictures of fetuses and comparisons to Hitler. Not the classiest group, but they were polite when I declined their lit.  Users/AndrewPeake

20071127 23:13:30 nbsp Couldve been the http://www.abortionno.org/GAP/davis.html Genocide Awareness Project. Theyve been known to come to Davis in the past. However, normally their protests are highly organized and planned in advance. Perhaps abortionoriented Preachers with Signs? I seem to remember one incarnation with Redefeat Fascism + I Have a Dream of MLKs fame  Anti Abortion Activists, around and on the Day of the November 2006 Election. Users/MaxMikalonis

20071128 10:57:19 nbsp well I guess it sounds like the Teens for life group with old men and young girls. They had signs like the Genocide group. Thanks for the info.  Users/HeatherFlood

20091122 23:05:13 nbsp anyone interested in the recent protests and occupations should take a look at this manifesto from a group out at uc santa cruz.  http://wewanteverything.wordpress.com/2009/09/24/communiquefromanabsentfuture/ Users/ashiggins
  I just read this.  Sounds like a very sincere outrage, but the scope of it is really broad (lets get rid of capitalism?) without expressing any concrete ideas for what might replace the status quo.  What are these guys proposing?  An end to private property and markets?  State ownership of the means of production?  Statebacked redistribution of existing assets?  I couldnt see what I was being asked to do or to support except to feel a resentment that the market system doesnt provide everyone everywhere with a livelihood, and to physically block the functioning of the UC system in the hope that this would build up in a movement that would destroy the existing market system and replace it with... what?  Users/KenjiYamada
   the purpose of this manifesto, i think, is to inspire those who already know (or have a deep nagging suspicion) that the current system is morally bankrupt and a dead end, rather than to offer concrete advice as to what should come after capitalism.  in that respect, and in style, it is reminiscent of recent calls such as http://tarnac9.wordpress.com/texts/thecominginsurrection/ the coming insurrection.  attempting in such a short space to address the many questions regarding a postcapitalist world would be impossible.  the natural place to turn for such ideas would be the vast anarchist literature that already exists.  classic texts by bakunin and kropotkin, michael alberts work on participatory economics, murray bookchin, noam chomsky, curtis white, david graeber (check out his http://www.pricklyparadigm.com/paradigm14.pdf fragments of an anarchist anthropology pdf), even naoimi kleins documentary the take.  much work has already been done outlining what a nonhierarchical, nonauthoritarian communist society might look like, you just need to be proactive enough to explore whats out there.  Users/ashiggins
    Blocking the function of a public system to destroy capitalism? And people wonder why things like this are never taken seriously. Who writes this stuff? This just looks like angry ranting coming from some liberal arts major who sees the man and capitalism in everything he or she hates. The problem we have with the UC system is something that commonly arises with a public system. Instead of trying to run the UC system more efficiently, the regents decided to ask for more money from both the state and students even though current student fees cover all the costs of an undergraduate education. They do this while increasing the salaries of administrators at the top. This is like last spring when the Post Office asked for more money from the Federal Government while asking to work less. Whenever a public system has tax dollars as an out and the people in charge of the system are left unchecked, this is what is going to happen. They dont have the same motivation as businesses do to change the way they do things for the better (although businesses too big to fail no longer need the motivation). Users/hankim
     Youve got your history completely backwards.  Fees have never covered the cost of education  not even close  and in the beginning, were only supposed to be for things like gym membership.  The state has been decreasing the amount of money given the the public universities, and this has been going on for decades.  Some of the money has been made up with fundraising, but again, that only goes so far.  Im not happy about admin salaries either, but that is a tiny, tiny piece of the problem.  A drop in the bucket.  The problem is that the state is not living up to the Master Plan for Higher Education.   Users/CovertProfessor
      My source about fees: http://universityprobe.org/2009/04/budgetliesalettertothepresidentofuc/ Users/hankim
       Thats a very interesting article  thank you for sharing it.  If it is correct, then there is more money going into highranking administration and much more flexibility in spending than ucop has said.  Those points definitely need to be brought out into the open and discussed  perhaps they have and I have just missed it?  But I want to comment on the part of the article that says, What you call the “funding for perstudent education at UC” is a piece of accounting fraud that I have repeatedly criticized. The numbers you use to calculate that actually cover all of the costs for faculty research work throughout the academic year as well as undergraduate plus graduate educational programs. When I disaggregate that bundle of expenses, it turns out that undergraduate student fees now cover the full perstudent cost for UC to provide undergraduate education. So the reduction in state funding is really a cutback in the faculty’s research program. That is a lamentable loss, but it is totally unjustified to dump that cost onto undergraduate students (and their families).  None of that makes sense to me, for two reasons:  1) I am paid a salary, and that salary is for me to research, teach, and do service.  My salary isnt broken down into a research component, a teaching component, and a service component.  So, I dont know how one could estimate costs of research versus the other costs (perhaps he means lab costs, etc.?) 2) More importantly, what makes the UC the UC  different from the CSU  is the emphasis on research.  Its what makes it an institution with a better reputation (which, among other things, improves ones chances of getting a job), and its what makes it a good school for students who want to go onto grad school or who want to be taught by professors who are active in their fields and doing cutting edge work.  So, it doesnt make sense to say that undergrads should only pay for their education.  By choosing to go to a UC, they are choosing to go to a school where the professors do substantial amounts of research, and that costs money.  If they want to go to a school and not pay for research, then they should not be going to the UC.  (Profs in the CSU do research, too, but there is less emphasis on it).   Users/CovertProfessor
          One thing that could make the website better is if the author posted PDFs of the sources, but I still find the site pretty reliable because the author puts his name and position on the line. Also, you probably did not hear about it because protesters prefer to be loud than informed most of the time. My guess about the salary issue is that the author divided accordingly by counting how many hours he devotes to each part of his job. Or maybe the author counted the entire salary and it was still covered by fees. I always wondered, if research is so important to the UC system, why does the university take fifty percent of all private research grants given to professors (was told this by one of my ECS professors)?
