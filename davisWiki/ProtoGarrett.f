Garrett Food whore. Wanna know more? http://vanillagarlic.blogspot.com/

I was an English Major with a minor is Social Ethnic Relations. Worked as an RA, an Aggie Columnist, and a few other things. I work in the NonProfit sector with plans for grad school in the next year or so. I also work now part time as a staff writer for the magazine Edible Sacramento. I live with my domestic partner Rob, and our two cats Mace and Cid in our shibby blue apartment.

I also write a food blog as you see above. I hope to maybe get paid for this shit one day, but it works as a hobby too. I lurvs me my food/eating/cooking, final fantasy, lit, and volleyball. Hit me up if you wanna chat about any of it, or go out and review a restaurant with me. Company always welcome. Peace.
