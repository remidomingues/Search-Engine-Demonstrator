Psi Chi is the National Honor Societies Honor Society in Psychology, founded in 1929 for the purpose of encouraging, stimulating and maintaining excellence in scholarship and advancing the science of psychology.

Psi Chi is a member of the Association of College Honor Societies (ACHS) and is an affiliate of the American Psychological Association (APA) and the American Psychological Society (APS).

Psi Chi functions as a federation of chapters located at more than 880 senior colleges and universities in the USA. A National Council, composed of psychologist who are Psi Chi members and who are elected by the chapters, guides affairs of the organization and sets policy with the approval of the chapters.

 The Goals of Psi Chi 

Psi Chi serves two major goals  one immediate and visibly rewarding to the individual member, the other slower and more difficult to accomplish, but offering greater rewards in the long run.

The first of these is the Societys obligation to provide academic recognition to its inductees by the mere fact of membership.

The second goal is the obligation of each of the Societys local chapters to nurture the spark of that accomplishment by offering a climate congenial to its creative development. For example, the chapters make active attempts to nourish and stimulate professional growth through programs designed to augment and enhance the regular curriculum and to provide practical experience and fellowship through affiliation with the chapter.

In addition, the national organization provides programs to help achieve these goals, including national and regional conventions held annually in conjunction with the psychological associations, research award competitions, and certificate recognition programs. Also, the Society publishes a Psi Chi newsletter which helps to unite and inform the members and to recognize their contributions and accomplishments.
 The Benefits of Psi Chi 

The intrinsic value of membership is rewarding to the achiever in that recognition of excellence leads to selffulfillment and thus to selfrealization. By recognizing that what you do does make a difference, you are stimulated to higher productivity. Accomplishments are enjoyed more when shared with others. Furthermore, the contacts made through Psi Chi will be valuable throughout your educational and professional careers.

Concrete advantages of membership include:

      The documents  a membership certificate and card which give tangible evidence of membership.
      The references provided throughout ones lifetime (this service alone is worth the investment).
      The experience gained by working with Psi Chi is excellent for building up a resume; it is difficult to attain that first managerial and creative experience.
      Psi Chi is a springboard for professional growth. Opportunities are made available to the members for promoting their research, receiving national and international recognition, meeting and interacting with leaders in their field, and meeting Psi Chi members of other chapters who also will be future leaders.
      The United States government recognizes membership in Psi Chi as meeting one of the requirements for entrance at the GS7 level in the Federal Service.

Climaxing the benefits mentioned above is knowing that many individuals, by their caring, dedication, perseverance, and hard work, have made it possible to encourage young persons interested in psychology to strive for excellence  to reach toward that attainable star.

The ultimate test of the value of any membership organization lies in the accomplishments of its members. In each year of Psi Chis history, more and more members have undertaken graduate studies. Now in its 68th year, Psi Chi is well represented in the professional ranks of all the behavioral sciences. The membership directories of the American Psychological Association and the American Psychological Society are studded with the names of Psi Chi members, both active and alumni. This is only one example demonstrating that the Societys purposes are being fulfilled.
How to Join Psi Chi?

Students become members by joining the chapter at the school where they are enrolled. Psi Chi chapters are operated by student officers, faculty advisors and academic advisors. Together they select and induct the members and carry out the goals of the Society.
