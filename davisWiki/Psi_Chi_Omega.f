Psi Chi Omega (ΨΧΩ) aka Psi Chis is an AsianAmerican Interest Fraternity whose brothers pride themselves on the three pillars; Integrity, Perseverance, and Eternal Brotherhood. Psi Chi Omega strives to achieve excellence among individual brothers with regards to academics, athletics, social development, and campus involvement. We actively participate in brotherhood events with our other three chapters in events such as annual ski and camping trips and visiting them at their chapters. We also hold regular social exchanges with many AsianAmerican Sororities all across Northern California campuses. Psi Chi Omega provides the tools needed in building wellrounded men, who will be prepared to enter the real world after college. Although the foundation of Psi Chi Omega is an AsianAmerican Interest, we pride ourselves in our diversity as our brothers range from Caucasian, Hispanic, Indian, Korean, Chinese, Cambodian, Vietnamese, and more. Our mens rush are primarily scheduled for the first week of Fall and Spring Quarters, whereas Lil Sis rush is held during the beginning of Winter Quarter.



 Campus and Community Involvement 

Campus involvement and community service are important aspects of Psi Chi Omega. In the past, we have helped with Asian American Association (AAA) with putting on their annual Asian American Film Festival. We have also participated in Relay For Life to provide awareness for cancer research. However, we are not limited to events in the Davis region; as we are looking to expand and look into projects in other areas such as the AIDS Walk in San Francisco. We can also be seen on various Davis football, basketball, and volleyball games selling concessions and showing support our for the Aggies.

More recently, we have continued to service the community through direct service such as volunteering at the Asian American Heritage Festival in San Francisco with our brother chapters as well as partnering with other Asian American organization(s) to host The Cause, our annual philanthropic benefit concert that raises money towards our designated charity for the school year.




 General History 


It all started rather casually in the University of California Price Center. Brothers Rob, Hoai, Frank, Nick, Kim and Doug were engaged in an intense discussion on the Greek Fraternities Fraternity system and the role of AsianAmericans in this complex network. The focal point of the conversation dealt with the paradoxical need for maintaining a unique Asian identity, while at the same time being to acculturate into the already existing fraternal establishment. The brothers concluded that an organization with an AsianAmerican emphasis, and an outlook which understands the importance of integration over isolation, could be successful in linking these two cultures. Thus, from humble beginnings, the foundation of a unique AsianAmerican fraternity was born.

On January 24, 1992, twentysix ambitious founding fathers brought Psi Chi Omega into existence. The Brothers of Psi Chi Omega have since been working to establish traditions which promote excellence through integrity, perseverance, and eternal brotherhood. By providing opportunities to expand scholastic capabilities, enhance leadership skills, and be involved in all cultures, the members of Psi Chi Omega strive to achieve a better understand of our unique, AsianAmerican Heritage.


 Gamma Chapter History 


During the Spring of 1995, a group of ambitious men at the University of California, Davis, assembled in the Mee Room of the Memorial Union to discuss the possibilities of creating a new AsianAmerican fraternity. Out of this long and arduous search, sprung eleven strong minded individuals who gained a renewed sense of awareness about themselves, and what they were looking for in a fraternity. All of the Brothers agreed that the fundamental principle of a fraternity is the unity found in brotherhood. With this desire, Psi Chi Omega became the ideal fraternity whose traditions promote excellence through Integrity, Perseverance, and Eternal Brotherhood. Its seemingly strong interchapter relationships further strengthened their desire to become a part of Psi Chi Omega. Consequently, the Brothers of Gamma Colony accepted Psi Chi Omegas bid to establish a new fraternity at the University of California, Davis on February 20, 1996 and was ultimately chapterized on January 24, 1997. As our fraternity perpetually grows, our underlying goals continue to be the devotion to our chapters and an uncompromising commitment Brotherhood.

Lil Sis Program 

History
The Psi Chi Lil Sis program was first developed in winter 2004 to allow young college age women to enter fraternity/sorority life without having to commit full time obligations and duties of being an official member of the Greek system. The Lil Sis Program strives to achieve camaraderie and friendship among the brothers and Lil Sis of the program with exciting social events. The program also seeks provides academic support with weekly study hours. However, the ultimate goal of the Lil Sis Program is to create an eternal bond of friendship between the brothers and their little sisters.

Purpose
After a long and arduous discussion of a little sister program and its role in Psi Chi Omega, the brothers at the University of California, Davis, all agreed that a little sister program would be beneficial to the fraternity. It is the vision of the brothers that the little sister program would serve as a social, service, and academic entity inside the fraternity that would allow young open minded women to be part of the fraternity. We all hope the little sister program will create an eternal bond of friendship between the brothers and their little sisters. Although Psi Chi Omega has been traditionally an AsianAmerican Fraternity, it has never turned away anyone who has proven himself worthy to the brotherhood. This will hold true for the little sister program as well.




20100827 00:00:41 nbsp So I have been sticking around the Class of 2014 Facebook page answering peoples questions about classes and such (and plugging in one link to Davis Wiki) and I notice that someone has been constantly plugging this fraternity on the page. Sure, other clubs and frats have posted plugs on the page as well, but this frat is constantly being http://img827.imageshack.us/img827/9691/screenshot20100826at115d.png plugged by someone to the point it smells like spam. I know nothing else about this fraternity, but such shameless advertising puts them in a slightly negative light.  Users/hankim
