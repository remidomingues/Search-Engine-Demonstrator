Psi Phi (ΨΦ) is the newest Fraternities Fraternal Organization at UC Davis.  Psi Phi is the fraternity of the future, and they spend a lot of time examining the future.  (Some of them are even members of the Historical Preenactment Society.)  Every week, theyre going to show scifi or fantasy movies at Psi Phi House as part of their commitment to all things futuristic.  Of course, these are not public showings as no one would ever, ever consider violating intellectual property rights.

Psi Phi was started by Users/BrentLaabs Brent Laabs, from an idea he got from Users/AdrienneMcCarthy Adrienne McCarthy.  Of course, many others have had the similar idea of using Psi Phi as a pun on scifi.

Users/BrentLaabs, Users/DavidPoole, Users/WilliamLewis, and Users/StewartShearer all lived at Psi Phi House in East Davis.

Users/MichelleAccurso was also a Psi Phi member, beta class.

Notable alumni include:
  Jack Zwald, ASUCD President
  James Hodgson, GSA Chair 20072008
  Users/Chibi, Fraternity mascot

Psi Phi has a strong Phasers, not hazers policy.  That said, pledges are required to watch the Star Wars Holiday Special.

 Upcoming Events 

Movie night: Sometime in the future!

20080123 19:30:09 nbsp I may or may not show up to some of the Psi Phi events.  Or perhaps not.  Or maybe I already have.  But since I dont exist, I clearly could not have been there.  And even if I had, how would you know?  :) Users/IDoNotExist

20080123 23:59:04 nbsp I often sneak into Psi Phi in the middle of the night. I have also been involuntarily volunteered to run for Psi Phi Sweetheart. But I still <3 psi phi Users/MichelleAccurso

20080207 18:53:07 nbsp I do my laundry at Psi Phi House.  The members are quite awesome.  Users/BreeButler

20080224 22:34:44 nbsp Im proud to be a brother of Psi Phi. Users/JackZwald

20080224 23:19:32 nbsp If the future is now, have we no future?  I read about Psi Phi in the past, which claimed that the future was then as well.  I can only conclude that future is past, past is present, present is future, and time has ceased to flow. Users/IDoNotExist
   I believe you have misunderstood their motto.  Future is a type of fashionable outfit for performing martial arts, as in Kung Fu haute couture.  In this context, of course, now is a Norwegian cow.  In short, these sickos dress up cows and force them to do open hoof battle on catwalks just as their bovine viking ancestors did.  Users/JabberWokky

20080225 09:59:57 nbsp Temporal bovine combat fashion when the future is now?  Im interested in the results of this form of combat, so I must ask: How now, brown cow? Users/IDoNotExist

20080225 10:04:20 nbsp Psi Phi house is much like a parallel universe.  Identical in every way to other realms that one may also visit, yet somehow slightly different.  Perhaps they are responsible for the recent invasion of cowlike entities in Davis. Users/IDoNotExist
