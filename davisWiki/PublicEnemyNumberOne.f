20100802 13:02:16 nbsp Hi, and welcome to the wiki. I saw your edit on the Friendly Cab page.  It sounds like your experience with them was pretty bad, and if things went as you say that they did, I dont blame you for being angry.  However, the way you phrased your comment used some very insulting language and made it into a personal attack.  So, as a fellow editor of the wiki, I deleted your comment.  I encourage you to leave another comment on the page that is perhaps a bit more toned down.  Just to be clear, its fine to be critical, but please try to tone down your language, especially the personal attacks. Users/CovertProfessor

20100809 10:08:19 nbsp Are you aware that its possible to leave a negative review that doesnt make you sound just as bad as the company youre reviewing?  Please consider editing under your Importance of Using Your RealName real name and establishing a bit of identity.  It will probably help you remember to be at least halfway civil.  This isnt 4chan, its the Davis Wiki. Users/TomGarberson

20101220 17:55:45 nbsp It sounds like youre spitting mad and you havent calmed down enough to say something that much sense can be made of.  Im sorry that you had a bad experience.  It would be helpful if you gave more time detail.  You could also email to info@7501111.com. Users/BruceHansen

20101220 19:39:10 nbsp PublicEnemyNumberOneYour attitude and wording reminds me of a pissedoff little teenager. When you have issues with a company, there is usually a professional way to address those concerns. Threatening violence on the Wiki is not welcomed. If you have a concern Mr. Hansen is more then willing to assist you if you are willing to act in somewhat of an adult manner. Users/PeterBoulay

20120108 14:49:28 nbsp Hi PENO, Just a reply to you on your comment to PeterBoulay... Everyone can edit the wiki and no one is paid to contribute. You can edit and contribute too. If you are in fact mentally unstable, Im no doctor, but I would recommend getting some help. Happy Editing to you! :) Users/jsbmeb

20120108 16:31:18 nbsp As you have decided to become an editor of the wiki, I would ask that you treat your fellow editors with respect, just as you do your fellow Davisites.  Thank you. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
