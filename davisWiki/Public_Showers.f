 Open to all 
  Haring Hall Haring 1301 (near southwest doors)  At the back of this UCD Bathrooms mens restroom is a single small and dirty shower. It has a shower curtain.
  Hickey Gym  There are showers you can access from the locker rooms (one in the womens locker room and one in the mens). The showers are also accessible from the Hickey Pool pool as well. Not really restricted since nobody checks your ID when you enter so...
  Plant and Environmental Sciences Building Plant and Environmental Sciences Building 1244B  this is a lactation station, with a small shower for women to rinse themselves (not a normal, fullsize shower)
  Swimming Swimming Pools
  Veihmeyer Hall  at the east end, in the restroom under the stairwell (no room number) is a single shower.

 Restricted access 
  ARC  new, private, comfortable showers with plenty of traffic.
  King Hall  The basement bathrooms have single showers.  Rarely used and clean.
  Rec Pool  heavily used and not so nice.
  Sciences Laboratory Building  Off of the main hallway on the second floor one can find an individual shower. Its relatively new and very clean. It seems to be used mainly for breastfeeding. A sign on the door says This is not a public bathroom.
  Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital  second floor, female locker room
  Davis Athletic Club  its got tons of showers, but you have to be a member

20110426 17:05:09 nbsp It seems bizarre that the most bicyclefriendly city in the country would not have even a single public shower for bicycle commuters. Users/SteveDavison
