Its been said that more people are afraid of Public Speaking than they are of death. Seinfeld had an entire standup bit joking about this.

Fortunately in Davis you have some help.

The Toastmasters, Davis Daytime Toastmasters, and Norwood 4H Club are where you can pick up and practice such speaking skills, and maybe overcome your fear.
