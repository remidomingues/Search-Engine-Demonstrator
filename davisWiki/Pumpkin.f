Pumpkin was born in June 2007, and then Allison http://daviswiki.org/Users/AllisonMiller found her and brought her home. Pumpkin enjoys hanging out in her pink igloo house and eating tons of timothy hay! Shes currently living at Allisons parents house because Allisons Davis apartment is waaaay too cold for Pumpkin to live comfortably in. Shell be back in Davis when its a bit warmer.
