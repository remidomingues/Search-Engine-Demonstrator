Pumpkins are a type of squash that has Halloween cultural and Thanksgiving culinary popularity, given their affiliations with different American holidays.  Though stereotypically large, orange and gourdlike, pumpkins come in a variety of colors, textures, shapes and sizes.  Small, orange sugar pie pumpkins (the variety considered most ideal for cooking) can be found yearround in local grocery stores, whereas the larger Jack O Lantern pumpkins can be found there during October.  Specialty pumpkins like Lumina, Jarradale and Giant varieties are available at local pumpkin patches.
