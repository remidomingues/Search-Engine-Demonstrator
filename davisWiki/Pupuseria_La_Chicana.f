Pupuseria La Chicana is Yolo Countys premier Pupusa destination. This familyrun, Salvadorean/ Mexican restaurant is located in Downtown Woodland, just outside of the historical district. The building was once a Taco Bell, but the the colorful inside, hand written signs, and friendly (nonuniformed) employees give a unique, home style feeling to the classic http://usedtobetacobell.com TacoBell brick architecture. The prices are very low and the portions and flavors are very generous.

What is a Pupusa
Pupusas are the signature dish of El Salvador. They are thick corn Tortillas that can be filled with Chicharron (seasoned ground pork), Queso (soft white cheese) Frijoles (refried beans), Loroco (bud flower), squash, or some combination of those ingredients. Pupusa Revuelta is probably the most popular Pupusa  and consists of Chicharron, Queso, and Frijoles.

Should you feel bad about eating pupusas? Maybe. Check out Ethical Eating page and decide for yourself.

Menu
The restaurant has a giant printed menu spanning the entire front counter area. Its very difficult to photograph, though that hasnt stopped some people from failing to do so on on http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pupuserialachicanawoodland?selectxNHNAZROTMVoJpy45EhWw#JhX2CC9K52LKaIwcaUCb4w Yelp. There are no printed take out menus so you have to go in and check it out for yourself. But basically it has everything you would expect to find at a Mexican restaurant + Pupusas + other Salvadorean treats + breakfast.
