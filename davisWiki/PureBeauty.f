20060123 14:29:05 nbsp They have this awesome hair gel that is also a temporary hair dye.. and its pretty awesome.. thats all i have to say. Users/JulienBiewerElstob

20060821 13:25:20 nbsp PureBeauty (North) is wonderful. Great selection of products, very friendly staff, and Veronica is awesome with hair! Users/AnnieAnnie

20060918 17:03:29 nbsp The women who does eyebrows (not currently remembering her name, sorry!) does eyebrows WONDERFULLY! and is very patient.  Users/AnnieSirrah

20061224 14:21:10 nbsp I just got my eyebrows done here a week ago.  They did a great job, but $20 is a little high for getting my eyebrows done.  Nevertheless, the woman paid attention to all the small details and did a great job. Users/RohiniJasavala

20070131 10:14:44 nbsp Jenn (@ the South Davis location) gives the most awesome facials.  Shes very good at catering to specific skin types, including if your skin is different all over your face.  For one of my facials, she put about 3 different specialized masks in different spots on my face since my skin is weird like that.  But shes wonderful!  Book her ASAP, cuz she books out fast. Users/AndreaPasiliao

20070318 21:17:27 nbsp Got my eyebrows done here.  Will DEFINITELY come back.  It felt like Kari was trying to work with my eyebrows, not against them.  She took a minute to see their natural shape and relation to my face before she went to work on them.  The results were awesome.  Not only that, but the N. Davis location has a seerate room for waxing, which is really nice not having to be out in the open.  In conclusion, Kari IS the Waxing Queen, highly reccommended, a bit pricey, but well worth the cost. Users/AllisonEriksen

20070504 15:58:07 nbsp Kari (of North Davis) is the BEST for eyebrows! I have never done anything with my eyebrows ever and decided today to bite the bullet and get them done. I have always been afraid of someone messing them up or that it would hurt a lot. She discussed what she was going to do and what I would like done and then used a very gentle was that wasnt very painful at all. I absolutely love what she did and I will never go to anyone else! Users/AmberMacdonald

20070520 12:28:57 nbsp i had my eyebrows waxed here by their waxing specialist & also usually get my hair cut also by veronica.  they were both really friendly, personable and really listens to what kind of look you are going for.  definitely worth the price to guarantee you to get what you want, instead of risking it somewhere else and having to pay to have it fixed.   Users/MikaOkamura

20070531 17:18:33 nbsp I just got my bangs cut by Veronica and she did a great job! She was really nice and let me know that when you get your full hair cut there, bang cuts are free in between cuts.  Users/AcaciaMora

20070620 08:28:28 nbsp Kari at the Market Place does the best eyebrows. She listens to exactly what you want, doesnt over pluck or overarch. I havent found anyone that good since I moved from LA.  Users/Renngrrl

20070628 13:07:26 nbsp I recently went to Pure beauty and had veronica as my sylist. Being a student and not knowing much, she was extremely helpul and attentive to my requests. She helped me pick a color for my first partial highlight and described a cut that turned out fantastic. My friends were shocked to see the transformation. The highlights were real natural and added an extra shine to my hair. She was patient and pampered me with water and fruit duirng the 2 plus hour session. She also styled and curled my hair showing me syling tips along the way. She is super friendly and nice to talk to. Overall the paritial highlight,shampoo,condition, cut and style was $135 (50 for the cut and $85 for partial highlights) everything else was a bonus, I am now curling my hair using he salon secret , go see veronica to find out and enjoy an experience. Having been a great clips customer I will definely go back to pure beauty again and again to have veronica stlye and cut my hair. Fantastic experience and worth the money spent   Users/ElizabethBarthel

20070713 23:41:41 nbsp Veronica at North Davis PB is fantastic!  I love my new cut.  Shes definitely my new stylist. Users/EmilyBlake

20070718 19:17:51 nbsp I was really excited when I went to PureBeauty for just a haircut, I later found out they do so much more that. I saw Brianna at the North Davis store and she had alot to share with me about all the Education they do to update their skills. I think its great that PureBeauty pays for that for them. It really showed from the haircut that Brianna gave me.Ive been looking for someone that does Hair Extensions in Davis and she told me that she does them, plus they use Hair Dreams Extensions, I heard those were the best. I cant wait till I can get some. I recommend seeing her for anything, she is really good!!! Users/CAROLKIMBEL

20070826 15:26:12 nbsp Jenn at Oakshade is DA BOMB, love you girlfriend! Users/ElisaWeller

20080107 11:23:55 nbsp Purebeauty in south Davis is the BEST! They were just recently remodeled and it looks amazingly beautiful... All there associates are extremely friendly and knowledgeable. There stylist (Janet)is super creative and experienced. The skin room is very inviting and serene, Jen the esthetician gives the best facials and even makes waxing pleasant. BEST eyebrow shaping in town!!!! Users/angi

20080330 15:42:45 nbsp I wish there were more skin care products, but their hair products are amazing. The girls that work there are so friendly and recommend the perfect products. Users/FeliciaTing

20080331 18:27:24 nbsp Ive been to the North Davis twice to get my eyebrows waxed and Kari is the best. She doesnt overwax or overpluck, and knows how to make your arch work for your face structure. Waxing is very comfortable with serene music and a clean room. At a good price too, you wont regret it.
 Users/Adrienne

20080404 16:46:16 nbsp Jen, at the South Davis location is Amazing!!! I have been going to Jen for almost three years now. I go to her for both waxing and facials.  I suffered with acne since I was twelve years old. I have tried everything from antibiotics to acutane and nothing has worked.  Since I started getting facials and chemical peels from Jen my face has cleared up.  I no longer need to use antibiotics or harsh creams. oh ya and my eyebrows look great. Thanks Jen!!! Users/ndcalero

20080409 11:20:36 nbsp I unfortunately cant remember the name of the girl who did my hair at the north davis location. I think it was Lisa? She did a great job with my hair. I FINALLY found someone who told me yes, that will work with your type of hair. Plus she has naturally curly hair, so if you need help with that, shes the person to go to!

It did end up being expensive, though. $55 for the hair cut/style/shampoo and another $40 for a hair product that was not really necessary (but I am a bit challenged in the hair styling area).  Users/Kiran

20080413 12:04:22 nbsp I just went to see Kari in North Davis :) yesterday for my brows and she did a terrific job! I had a bad brow wax about a month and half ago and have been letting them grow out. They still need some growing, but she made them look so much better and knew exactly how to shape them. She kept checking in with me to make sure she wasnt taking too much off  wonderful job!  Users/Rachelottlinger

I have used Karis services for years while she was with Pure Beauty.  I must say her new location at A+ Image is so nice.  The office is spacious, professional and so relaxing.  The very best part is the PARKING!  Since she is now located in an office building there are tons of spaces available.  You can expect the same fantastic service we are all used to from Kari and in a great location.

20080603 12:57:34 nbsp I had my haircut and highligths done with Brianna many times. The results varied from time to time. I often had to go back to fix it, and she was nice in the sense that she did not charge me. However, I wish my hair was perfect without having to go back twice. A couple of times I asked for lowlights and my hair turned greenish/bluish. I was not happy with her anymore and decided to try a new salon outside of Davis (Bibbos in Union Square, San Francisco) The owner told me that she did a terrible job with my highlights, and he used a mirror to show me some spots in the back that she messed up. I was happy with my hair after the visit to the salon in San Francisco, but I have decided to try some more places in Davis. Wish me good luck! Users/TeresaV

20080816 14:18:54 nbsp Thanks to everyone for the nice comments about my work, that means a lot! Also thanks to Davis Wiki for providing such a great resource to the ladies of Davis! Mention Davis Wiki at your next appointment with Jen @ Oakshade and receive a special discount! Users/jwendt

20080905 10:58:35 nbsp Aww Im so sad Kari moved! She did a great job on my eyebrows a while back. But i just went in today to get them done again, but this time by Angie! I have to say she did just as good of a job as Kari and she was really nice!  Users/HeatherB

20080919 08:46:18 nbsp I have previously had the Aline, or inverse bob, haircut and grew it out long for my recent wedding.  Now that Im married, I was eager to get it chopped back off.  I went to pure beauty as I had a card there from when I last went in 2005.  Kaylen was my stylist; she seemed somewhat young and inexperienced but tried not to judge her by looks.  I told her I wanted an Aline haircut.  I described the haircut.  I corrected her when she showed me the side view and it didnt look like I wanted.  I BROUGHT A PICTURE of myself with that haircut.  She spent almost two hours cutting my hair (a haircut that has taken other stylists only 3045 minutes) and it became more and more clear that she did not understand what I wanted or how to give that haircut despite all my efforts to explain it to her. At the end of it my hair was cut straight across the back like a regular bob.  I expressed my unhappiness, but was rushed out as she had another client waiting. After going home I called back and asked to have a refund or have it fixed, and I was treated like a difficulttoplease problem client.  They not only told me I couldnt have a refund, but threatened to make me pay to have my haircut fixed.  I was told that I could only have it fixed at no charge if I had the same stylist as before, which makes no senseI had no desire to let her touch my hair again.  I had to threaten to report them to the Better business bureau before they would refund my money.  Afterwards I went to Vanessa at Ninas and she was shocked both by my actual haircut and the treatment Id recieved.  I will not be returning to pure beauty; for $50 a haircut, Id prefer to have someone that isnt fresh out of cosmetology school this 2008 year. Users/limotruck87

20081008 13:04:11 nbsp I get my eyebrows waxed regularly by Angie (North Davis). I have very thick eyebrows, and I used to get very nervous when getting them waxed because I dont want them shaped thin. The first time I went in, she listened to my requests, and since then she has shaped them exactly how I want them without needing to ask. The best part is that you can tell how much she enjoys her work. Users/djnejad

20081022 12:11:43 nbsp Jen at S. Davis gives wonderful facials!  All my blackheads are gone and my forehead feels SO smooth :)  Shes super nice and takes into consideration what the problem spots are.. Im totally going back for another! Users/ViVi

20090122 17:34:07 nbsp I have been to both Pure Beauties and am satisfied with both. I recently had my first encounter with Janet. My past stylist at North Davis was Veronica, she is great to. Janet was friendly,responsive, and very helpful. She was great with my hair and did not pressure me to buy products like most salons. She offered her advice and opinion and suggested a look that all my friends now love. She takes her time and does not overcharge. Overall, would go to her again in the future. I did purchase some products on my own because they were 60 percent off after Christmas sale. The store rep was nice at South Davis. Janet spent time with me showing how to properly curl my hair. I was very pleased with the result. Another perk of Pure Beauty is all their staff attends training paid for by the company. They also have a rewards card program when you spend 150 dollars on services or products you get a 15 dollar voucher good on anything in the store including clearance items. They also give you coupons in store for future. Both locations are nice. I would recommend Janet if you go to S. Davis and Veronica in North Davis.  Users/ElizabethBarthel

20100130 23:23:27 nbsp I just had a cut and color from Kaylen Robinson in the market place location and she did a wonderful job.  I always go places and explain eveything I want and they never seem to get it. I got lowlights and highlights and they turned out amazing, and I got it all for a pretty good deal.

20100227 14:14:44 nbsp I went to Pure Beauty (South Davis) yesterday and had the worst experience of my life. Janet practically burned my face with wax. While it is customary for ones face to burn after being waxed, my face is still burning..its been about 15 hours. Not only does my face still burn, my eyebrows are completely uneven. While Janet was a nice and friendly woman, she screwed up my face and I will never go to Pure Beauty again.  Users/kkardash

20100316 12:59:49 nbsp I went to PureBeauty in South Davis last Tuesday and recieved an awsome hair cut by a new stylist there named Josh W.  He gave me a great price because he is new to Davis from L.A. He was friendly and gave me great styling tips that I could try at home.  I have also seen Janet for a cut and color, and am very satisfied with both.  GREAT PEOPLE AT PUREBEAUTY!!! GO CHECK THEM OUT!!! Users/KLarsen

20100826 13:15:29 nbsp This place has one of the best consistent customer service I have seen in Davis. Ive gotten my hair cut at the North Davis location several time over the past couple years, and from my experience their haircuts are a hit or miss. Ive noticed though that the stylist, Kaylen, does a great job with layers (specifically shortmedium length to longer layers) if thats what youre looking for. But for bang trims and styling, I would recommend Brianna. This place also does bang trims for free if you got your last cut with them. I tried calling in recently for a bang trim with Brianna, but apparently she left this location already.  Users/MooMoo28

Most recently, I began to haunt the South Davis location to buy Katy Perrys Teenage Dream nail polish, but kept arriving too late to purchase it before it sold out! Thanks to a lovely associate there, though, who saved me a bottle without me asking, I finally managed to get it! Hooray for nice, attentive sales associates! Users/kthrnngo
