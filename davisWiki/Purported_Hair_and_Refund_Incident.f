20070831 19:43:37 nbsp Last night I went in with my boyfriend and ordered a salmon burrito and a tostada.  I found a hair in my salmon burrito, I called and spoke to a female manager who told me to go in the next day for a refund.  At first she offered me a replacement but I told her that I wanted a refund, and she told me to bring in the half eaten burrito with the hair in it.  Today my boyfriend went into Dos Coyotes (in South Davis) and spoke with a male manager and attempted to explain the situation to him to get the refund that was promised the night before.  Instead of being apologetic, the manager refused to give a refund and was very confrontational about the whole situation.  I called into Dos Coyotes headquarters in Davis and spoke to the owner Bobby Coyotes.  I explained to him the situation and he was helpful the first time and told me he would call the manager to check on the situation.  When he called me back after he spoke with the manager, he was extremely condescending and defensive about the whole situation.  I told him that I read the Davis Wiki and noticed that people have commented about experiencing food poison at his establishments.  He then became very defensive and said The Davis Wiki is full of crap.  He then proceeded to go on a tirade against the Davis Wiki and I tried to explain to him that patrons in Davis find this site very useful in reading what other people have to say about the establishments in this town and their experiences with these businesses.  After more arguing, I said that I would like him to send me a refund check in the mail and would not be returning to Dos Coyotes.  After the phone call, my boyfriend brought the burrito with the human hair in it back to the South Davis location to show the manager (since that was what we were instructed to do last night in order to get the refund, and to further prove that there really was a hair in it because they didnt believe us), the manager told my boyfriend to leave the store.  The manager than followed him out and tried to fight him after calling him several derogatory names (keep in mind this is all over a $7 burrito).  I then received a call from the owner Bobby again who starts to argue and yell at me over the phone because my boyfriend went in to show the manager the hair in the burrito.  This type of behavior and treatment of a customer is uncalled for.  If the manager had just apologized and gave us a refund, the situation would have been resolved.  Instead, they acted in a completely unprofessional manner and the owner showed utter disrespect towards patrons when it was his own establishment that made a mistake.  I had to hang up the phone with the owner because I felt threatened and did not want to subject myself to his verbal abuse, I told him that I would call the police on him if he continued to harass me.  He clearly does not care about his Davis patrons, shown through his bashing of the Davis Wiki.  Based on my experience, I would recommend not to go to Dos Coyotes since they clearly show that they do not care about Davis customers or the Davis Wiki.  This is the absolute worst experience I have ever had at any business. Users/AmyLee

 20070905 00:30:37 nbsp Wow, something tells me that story was a little embellished.  Ive found a hair in my food on a few occasions at different restaurants, but I never demanded a full refund, let alone called the owner at home, or sent my boyfriend to pick a fight with the manager.  Ive never commented on DavisWiki before, but that was just too stupid to pass up.Users/HeyMaestro

  I was waiting for anon users like you to comment.  Wow, the story is not embellished at all, something tells me you are from Dos Coyotes though.  First of all, the first thing I explained to the people at Dos is: I understand hair happens in food, not a huge deal but Id like a refund since I wasnt able to eat the burrito.  Second, I did NOT call the owner at home, I called him at his main Dos Office  which is listed on their website.  Third, I did not send my boyfriend to pick a fight with the manager  we were TOLD (by one manager named Stephanie) to bring in the burrito in order to get a refund.  Thats what pissed me off the most, the way the manager Steve acted  I get off work at 8:30, come back here and Ill kick your ass, or something similar to that, over a freaking burrito.  He didnt even TRY to work out the situation in a civilized manner, Im sure hes lying to cover his ass since he doesnt want to get fired.  He actually poked his head around the corner outside of the store to make sure no one was there before he tried to fight my boyfriend. The owner needs to talk to his managers and not hire people that lie and tries to start fights with customers.  oh, and its really childish to send people over to the wiki to delete my comment and write disgusting comments.  Im not deleting your comment am I? Im replying to it. Im sorry if its too hard to face the truth! And you know what? I actually called my friend Sharla Daly, who knows Bobby personally, to see if this is his normal treatment of customers or if he was just having a bad day.  I decided to be the bigger person and not file further complaints with the city and health department, being considerate of my conversation with Sharla and the fact that everyone does have bad days. Im still waiting for my refund.....AmyLee

20070905 01:03:28 nbsp Oh noes! Not hair!!!1 Users/JesseSingh

 haha, hair has become the least of my concern with the situation at this point.AmyLee

20070905 14:56:00 nbsp Sounds like a horrific story. Although nowhere near this complicated, I once reported a hair in my food at a Panda Express at Six Flags Magic Mountain. I wasnt grossed out by it, and I discovered it near the end of eating my food, and I wasnt interested in a refund (or refill) at all. They couldnt understand this, and after denying first that the hair I was holding was even a hair, then they said that I put the hair there myself. Keep in mind I told them I dont want anything. They were so resistant to admitting error that I just showed the Six Flags folks some cell phone pictures of the hair and filed a report. My advice is that if they dont own up and pay you back, report it. You have the evidence  the hair itself.
In all fairness to the anonymous commenter, this is the first time youve commented on the wiki as well. Consider making a personal page for yourself and become less anonymous. Your testimonial will be much more credible to the other wikizens.
BTW everyone  if you can go to Pacos in Woodland, (on Main Street), I recommend it over Dos. But Dos Navajo Nachos are always good. Users/KarlMogel

 Hey Karl, thanks for your comment.  Like I said above, I understand hair happens at food establishments, its the way that the situation was dealt with by the management of Dos Coyotes that really made me mad.  Ive actually been reading the wiki for years, I remember when Arlen first imed me about it when Phil was just starting it up.  My friend/landlord Mike Harrington and my house (The Turtle House) has held fund raisers for the Davis Wiki.  I lived with Dan, James, Rob etc. all last year up til last month, but I can understand how other Wikizens who might not know me may question credibility.  I can assure you all this situation has happened. I doubt they are going to own up at this point. I felt the need to share my experience with the Davis Wiki because people should know how Dos Coyotes acted  they cant keep getting away with this type of treatment (I genuinely believe its not right!).  Like I said, Im still waiting for the refund, Ill comment if I ever do receive it, but I highly doubt I will. Users/AmyLee

20070906 16:23:33 nbsp It seems as though demanding a refund instead of a replacement is going overboard. Also, I find it hard to believe that the people at Dos Coyotes simply started spewing bile on you with no provocation. It would be much easier to imagine a situation in which both parties may have lost their cool and said things that were less than polite, and I can say as one who works in food service myself that it seems very easy for a customer to, perhaps, not take into consideration the fact that the people serving them are also human beings. Users/JoePomidor

 editing b/c I feel like I just keep repeating myself Nope, if you are referring to the encounter with the manager  no, my boyfriend was not hostile with the manager Steve, he didnt even have a chance to talk.  I wish this hadnt happened, but it did.  We even called the police after the encounter, so there is a record.  My boyfriend actually worked in food service himself up until a week ago, so he knows what its like also.  Well, I personally dont think that asking for a refund for something I paid for but couldnt eat is unreasonable, but thats just me.  Users/AmyLee

20070918 01:08:19 nbsp This discussion has gotten ridiculous. I can attest, as someone who signed up for Daviswiki the day it went public and someone that has lived with Amy, that she is not only real but also a frequent reader of the wiki. That said, as a business manager myself I have had people complain about hair in the product on occasion at Ben & Jerrys (I have worked there over 8 years so dont freak out, it is statistically bound to happen) and when it happens we offer to replace the item or give a refund if asked. Basically the goal is to always the customer leave the store happy. I have had some con artists try to get free stuff with outlandish stories, any respectable manager should be able to sniff it out. Amys story seems pretty legit to me. The best thing to do would be to appease her, and I am sure she would publicly state it on this forum.

20070919 23:06:38 nbsp Hello Davisites! I would like to introduce myself. My name is Bobby Coyote, owner and founder of Dos Coyotes restaurants. Ive always shied away from writing on the Dos Coyotes page of Davis wiki because food is subjective like art  people are entitled to their opinions, whether it is a good or bad critique. Recently, however,  I was informed about an ongoing forum on the Davis Wiki about my name, employees, and restaurant being slandered. I would like to try and clear this up in the most amicable and proficient way possible. On Friday August 31st , at approximately 5 pm, I was told that there was a customer on the phone with a complaint. I immediately took the call and spoke to a Ms. Amy Lee. At this time, Amy was quite nice and informed me of a problem with her salmon burrito having a hair in it at our South Davis location. I apologized that there was a problem, and I asked her in a very non confrontational way if the hair might have been the hair from the husk of a corn since we have been charbroiling a lot of corn lately for our specials. I never once told her that I did not believe her. Amy told me that the night before she had spoken with Stephanie our manager who offered to send her a comp meal no questions asked, since the restaurant was already closed and they were about to leave. At that point, Amy told Stephanie that wasnt good enough and that she wanted a refund for both her meal, as well as a tostada consumed by her boyfriend (I found out about the tostada later from Stephanie). Stephanie told Amy to bring in the food the next day and speak to her manager Steve and that we would be happy to refund her meal. With this in mind, I took Amys number, and I believe her address  although that might have come later  and called the South Davis store to find out why there was a problem. I spoke with my manager Steve, who said that a young man named Chris came into the restaurant and was belligerent, rude, and condescending. He insinuated that he wanted a refund for the salmon burrito as well as the tostada, yet, did not have the burrito in hand as he was instructed the night before. Steve told Chris that without the burrito he could offer him a comp of the meal that could be used towards anything on the menu and that without the burrito he could not give him a full refund and that he cant just take money out of the cash register and give it to him, especially without seeing the food first. Steve told him that if he still would like to pursue the refund he would need to contact the corporate office. Chris then repeated to Steve that the solution was Âunacceptable and  at that point Steve offered the comp meal one more time and Chris said no and walked out. After getting off the phone with the South Davis store, I returned Amys call and was immediately confronted and threatened by her by how she had been on the Dos Coyotes Davis Wiki site and how she had read that we had given someone food poisoning. It was at this time that I told her that, Âyou cant take everything verbatim on the Davis Wiki, not that Âthe Davis Wiki is full of crap as she states on this site, and what she was referring to was  a customer who ate a meal and thought the food tasted like #@% , since he said he was sick for three days. Trust me, if there was one person who was sick for three days, from food poisoning, there would be hundreds of others with the amount of meals that we serve and it would have been a very serious problem. That was when I told Amy, since I was on the defensive about food poisoning that it just so happened that I had a letter from the County of Sacramento Board of Supervisors and Environmental Management Department issuing an award of excellence to Dos Coyotes for food safety for consistently maintaining high food safety standards.  While I was talking about this to Amy, her boyfriend Chris got on the phone and said that he was on speaker phone and rudely interrupted me. I asked him to please let me finish and then I would let him speak  instead he refused, and continued to interrupt. At this point there was a communication breakdown, since it was impossible to carry on a conversation with him because of his hostile attitude. At this point, I was so disturbed by their attitude I said I would send the refund and made sure I had the correct address. Approximately fifteen minutes later, Chris walked into the South Davis location, and between two families that were ordering food, slammed the half eaten burrito down on the counter between the registers and apparently stated: ÂYou think we were lying, well heres the burrito. I have many cashiers who witnessed this and said that Chris behavior was very confrontational and vulgar. Not to say that there was or was not any hair, but at that point we could not find the hair, most likely because the burrito was a day old. After this occured, Steve called me up at the office and told me what happened. That is when I called Amy up and asked her why Chris was coming into the restaurant and causing a scene when the problem had already been solved? Was there anything else I could do, since I thought the problem was already taken care of. That was when she stated she did not want to talk anymore, so we hung up. I still cannot comprehend how exactly Amy feels that I verbally harassed her or threatened her, since I spent the entire time on the phone either trying to solve her problem or listen to her boyfriend yell at me. I am also confused because there was never any mention of the police, so I dont know why that was written on this site as well. Dos Coyotes did all that we could to try to make this problem right. We tried to offer them a comp and that wasnt good enough. We simply asked to bring the food in, and Chris came in without the food. Lets say you went into a department store and bought a pair of jeans and later at home you found a hole in the inseam. You would have to bring the pants in to exchange or get a refund. So why do people think that a restaurant is somehow different than any other retail store? This problem would have never happened if the food was brought in as asked. What I dont understand is whether there was a piece of hair or not why Amy Lee feels slighted? Throughout the process she was blindly offered a comp of her meal, and if at any point had she brought the burrito into the store, a full monetary refund was guaranteed. She refused to follow the easy steps and then complained about it. And if you read what she wrote in her first post (20070831 19:43:37), she even explains that all she had to do was bring in the burrito and that her boyfriend brought it in only after the phone call. Other things I dont understand are that if Chris was so customer service oriented why would he be so rude and not understand how to talk, listen and respect people? Why does Amy Lee feel the need to drop the names of family friends such as Sharla Daly and Mike Harrington? For the record, the refund was placed in the mail box on Tuesday September 4th, 2007 for the Salmon Burrito. I am curious why Amy hasnt posted that she received the refund, since I personally signed it, addressed it, stamped it, and mailed it. In reflection, I probably should have taken a video of the check, the addressed envelope and me mailing it, the postmark and such  but hindsight is always clearer right? But most importantly, I am also disturbed that Amy claims that I dont care about my Davis patrons  this is anything but true. If I didnt care, why was I personally taking her phone call on Friday evening of Labor Day weekend? As a resident and business owner in Davis for the last eighteen years, Dos Coyotes has probably given back more to this community than any other restaurant in Davis. From everything from fireworks to benefits were always trying to find ways to thank the people who support us. The joke around town is that were the peoples nonprofit restaurant. We were just at the Pence Gallery benefit last Saturday night supporting the arts and on Thursday we will be serving food at All Things Right and Relevant benefiting Yolo County Mental Health Agencies. If anyone would like to talk to me about this incident or anything else Ill be out at the event on Thursday or you can always call the office (530.753.0202)   Im pretty accessible. As far as the comments as to whether Amy is a real person, I talked to her and she exists! I promise that what I have written is the truth and not exaggerated. If someone wants to pay, Id be more than willing to subject myself to a lie detector test as to what I personally experienced in this incident. Finally, I would like to thank those who genuinely post their opinions about my restaurants  we take their concerns, complaints and praise into hand. Moreover, I would like to thank whoever recently edited the top of our page to include that we are not a Mexican or TexMex joint etc.


Sincerely,

Bobby Coyote

For health and safety concerns, we need to see the contaminated food, not because we dont believe a customer, but because we need to realize the source of the contamination and correct it so the incident does not occur again.
 Yes I know this is from Sacramento County, however, we run our Restaurants with all the same high safety standards.

After reading Bobbys comment on the situation that happened, I feel the need to address his response line by line.  Although I know this situation has definitely been blown out of proportion, this was a simple matter that could have been solved in a simple way, I feel that Bobby is not relaying the events that occurred accurately.  Phil: Feel free to move these discussions to a Talk page as they are taking up a lot of room.  Here are my responses and my version of what occurred that day:

Hello Davisites! I would like to introduce myself. My name is Bobby
Coyote, owner and founder of Dos Coyotes restaurants. Ive always
shied away from writing on the Dos Coyotes page of Davis wiki because
food is subjective like art  people are entitled to their opinions, whether it is a good or bad critique. Recently, however, I was informed about an ongoing forum on the Davis Wiki about my name, employees, and restaurant being slandered. I would like to try and clear this up in the most amicable and proficient way possible.

  First off, no one is being slandered through comment.  I simply felt the need to share my experience with the DavisWiki community because I was so shocked and disturbed by the treatment from an establishment.  Bobby knew I was going to post a comment on the Wiki after I got off the phone with him, in fact, in our conversation, he challenged me to write what happened saying that he would respond also.  Which leads me to wonder who were the anonymous people that were deleting my original comment on the page?  Who is RudeInRoseville?  Why didnt Bobby respond earlier as he said he would instead of all these anonymous posters?  It is a coincidence that RudeInRoseville deleted all of his/her comments before Bobby posted his comment.  I, as well as any other Wikizens, have the right to comment about their experience at any particular establishment listed on the site.

On Friday August 31st , at approximately 5 pm, I was told that there was a customer on the phone with a complaint. I immediately took the call and spoke to a Ms. Amy Lee. At this time, Amy was quite nice and informed me of a problem with her salmon burrito having a hair in it at our South Davis location. I apologized that there was a problem, and I asked her in a very non confrontational way if the hair might have been the hair from the husk of a corn since we have been charbroiling a lot of corn lately for our specials. I never once told her that I did not believe her.

  I have no contest to any of the above, its pretty accurate.  Like I wrote in my original comment, Bobby was at first helpful and told me that he would call me back after he talked to his manager to find out why a refund would not be given.

Amy told me that the night before she had spoken with Stephanie our manager who offered to send her a comp meal no questions asked, since the restaurant was already closed and they were about to leave. At that point, Amy told Stephanie that wasnt good enough and that she wanted a refund for both her meal, as well as a tostada consumed by her boyfriend (I found out about the tostada later from Stephanie). Stephanie told Amy to bring in the food the next day and speak to her manager Steve and that we would be happy to refund her meal.

  First of all, I would like to point out that the last conversation I ever had with Bobby, he told me that he had JUST spoken with his manager Stephanie, who DENIED everything.  He said that she did NOT offer me a refund, when in fact she did (as Bobby is now stating).  I told him, this is a situation where its going to be my word against her word, at which point Bobby told me that he didnt want to get into that subject.  Why is he now saying that she in fact promise a refund when he very blatantly told me that she didnt?  Where is the problem then, if we could have just received the refund?

With this in mind, I took Amys number, and I believe her address
(although that might have come later) and called the South Davis store to find out why there was a problem. I spoke with my manager Steve, who said that a young man named Chris came into the restaurant and was belligerent, rude, and condescending. He insinuated that he wanted a refund for the salmon burrito as well as the tostada, yet, did not have the burrito in hand as he was instructed the night before. Steve told Chris that without the burrito he could offer him a comp of the meal that could be used towards anything on the menu and that without the burrito he could not give him a full refund and that he cant just take money out of the cash register and give it to him, especially without seeing the food first. Steve told him that if he still would like to pursue the refund he would need to contact the corporate office. Chris then repeated to Steve that the solution was unacceptable and at that point Steve offered the comp meal one more time and Chris said no and walked out.

  This is where I feel Bobbys description of the situation is flawed and inaccurate.  First off, this is SECOND hand information he is getting from his manager Steve.  This is what happened: Chris walked up to one of the cashiers and asked to speak with one of the managers.  Chris was very polite and explained the situation.  Chris explained to Steve that he had spoken to Stephanie the night before and that he was picking up the refund for the burrito ONLY, as promised by Stephanie.  Steve responded in a very rude and condescending manner saying that they do not give refunds and that the only thing he could do is give us another burrito.  At this point, we did not want to eat at Dos again and would rather have a refund.  The following sentence is entirely made up: without the burrito he could not give him a full refund and that he cant just take money out of the cash register and give it to him, especially without seeing the food first  Steve NEVER explained this to Chris.  Chris did not have the said burrito with him at the time because he had just gotten off work and drove by Dos on his way home to pick up the refund promised the night before from Stephanie.  This is when I called the Dos headquarters and spoke to Bobby about the situation.

After getting off the phone with the South Davis store, I returned Amys call and was immediately confronted and threatened by her by how she had been on the Dos Coyotes Davis Wiki site and how she had read that we had given someone food poisoning. It was at this time that I told her that, you cant take everything verbatim on the Davis Wiki, not that the Davis Wiki is full of crap as she states on this site, and what she was referring to was a customer who ate a meal and thought the food tasted like #@% , since he said he was sick for three days. Trust me, if there was one person who was sick for three days, from food poisoning, there would be hundreds of others with the amount of meals that we serve and it would have been a very serious problem.

  I NEVER threatened Bobby on the phone with the Davis Wiki.  At this point, he just started stating excuses and did not apologize or try to correct the situation.  In fact, I felt the conversation was going okay up until I brought up the Davis Wiki.  All I said was that I had read that someone else on the Wiki had a bad experience with food poisoning, this was the point when he started to go on a tirade against the DavisWiki.  He did say Âthe Davis Wiki is full of crap.  I wish I could have recorded the entire conversation, to have proof of what he is now recanting.  He did say that people can write what they want on the Wiki to hurt a business.  I agree that this can happen, but usually Wiki editors are quick enough spot these comments and do not let them get in the way of the page.

That was when I told Amy, since I was on the defensive about food
poisoning that it just so happened that I had a letter from the County
of Sacramento Board of Supervisors and Environmental Management
Department issuing an award of excellence to Dos Coyotes for food
safety for consistently maintaining high food safety
standards. While I was talking about this to Amy, her boyfriend
Chris got on the phone and said that he was on speaker phone and
rudely interrupted me. I asked him to please let me finish and then I
would let him speak instead he refused, and continued to interrupt. At this point there was a communication breakdown, since it was impossible to carry on a conversation with him because of his hostile attitude. At this point, I was so disturbed by their attitude I said I would send the refund and made sure I had the correct address.

  As I said above, Bobby only started to get aggressive and began to raise his voice to me on the phone after I brought up the DavisWiki.  Bobby started reading a letter to me that had absolutely nothing to do with my situation and would not let me say anything.  This was when I put the call to speaker so that Chris could hear how Bobby was talking to me on the phone.  Chris did not rudely interrupt, he just pointed out to Bobby that this letter did not cover Yolo county and had nothing to do with the situation at hand.  At this point, I motioned to Chris that I did not want to talk to Bobby.  I did not want to be spoken to that way by anybody.  Chris tried to talk to Bobby and did let him know that it was unacceptable to talk to anybody that way.  We were both so appalled that a businesses owner would treat his customers with such disrespect.  A simple apology and refund would have resolved the situation.  Im sure Bobby gets occasional complaints about hair in food since it is the nature of the food industry.

Approximately fifteen minutes later, Chris walked into the South Davis location, and between two families that were ordering food, slammed the half eaten burrito down on the counter between the registers and apparently stated: ÂYou think we were lying, well heres the burrito. I have many cashiers who witnessed this and said that Chris behavior was very confrontational and vulgar. Not to say that there was or was not any hair, but at that point we could not find the hair, most likely because the burrito was a day old. After this occured, Steve called me up at the office and told me what happened.

  This is also where Bobbys description fails.  He was not there, so he is relying on the words of his manager Steve.  First off there was ONE person in line, not two families as Bobby describes.  Chris set the burrito on the counter (on the part away from the registers), as soon as he did that Steve came out from the kitchen and behind the counter and told Chris to get out of the restaurant.  Steve did not even let Chris say anything, did not give him a chance to show the hair in the burrito, and just started to tell him to get out of the restaurant. Steve then proceeded to follow Chris out and asked him if he wanted to make this personal.  Steve made several derogatory comments, including using the word fag, and said insulting things about me.  He then said Do you want to fight?, and tried to start a fight with Chris right then.  Chris asked him what he was going to do , assault me?  Thats when Steve walked in to the courtyard area, looked around to see if anyone was watching, got within 34 inches of Chris face and called him a pussy for not punching him.  Chris was not about to start a fight over a stupid burrito as Steve was.  It seemed like Steve just had all this aggression and just wanted to fight.  Thats when Chris left, and Steve told Chris what time he got off work and to meet him back at Dos to kick the shit out of you.  This is absolutely unacceptable for ANY manager to behave this way, regardless of how bad their day is going.  THIS is what made me so upset about the whole situation.  There was a human hair in the burrito, this fact cannot be disputed.  If Steve had let Chris show him the hair in the burrito, they would have found it.  We even doubled checked before Chris brought it over.  Bobby is relying on the word of Steve, who is obviously an inept manager and doesnt want to lose his job.

That is when I called Amy up and asked her why Chris was coming into the restaurant and causing a scene when the problem had already been solved? Was there anything else I could do, since I thought the problem was already taken care of. That was when she stated she did not want to talk anymore, so we hung up.

  Bobby knows exactly why I had to hang up the phone on him. I even answered the phone very politely with  Hi Bobby, how are you?, thinking that he was calling to apologize for the way his manager Steve behaved.  Instead, he immediately started yelling at me because Chris went into the store to bring in the half eaten burrito (which he himself states that was necessary for a refund).  He did NOT ask if there was anything else he could do as he describes above, that is another lie. I find it interesting how he changes his story.  Before I hung up on him, I even told him that I did not want to take any further verbal abuse from him, I was so mad already from the way his manager treated Chris.  I told him not to contact me again or I would call the police for harassment.  I was concerned with what Steve would do, or even Bobby, since they now had my home address and telephone number. Users/AmyLee

I still cannot comprehend how exactly Amy feels that I verbally harassed her or threatened her, since I spent the entire time on the phone either trying to solve her problem or listen to her boyfriend yell at me. I am also confused because there was never any mention of the police, so I dont know why that was written on this site as well. Dos Coyotes did all that we could to try to make this problem right. We tried to offer them a comp and that wasnt good enough. We simply asked to bring the food in, and Chris came in without the food. Lets say you went into a department store and bought a pair of jeans and later at home you found a hole in the inseam. You would have to bring the pants in to exchange or get a refund. So why do people think that a restaurant is somehow different than any other retail store? This problem would have never happened if the food was brought in as asked.

She refused to follow the easy steps and then complained about it. And if you read what she wrote in her first post (20070831 19:43:37), she even explains that all she had to do was bring in the burrito and that her boyfriend brought it in only after the phone call.

  I did say in my original comment that Bobby had been helpful the first time I called him.  I appreciate him taking the time to call Steve to find out what was happening, but did not appreciate the attitude I received later from his mangers and from him.  Again, he is NOW saying that his manager Stephanie did offer a refund, a fact that he so adamantly denied on the phone.  Chris honestly did not think that it would be a problem to receive a refund because we asked Stephanie to leave a note for Steve.  Chris DID bring in the burrito, and was met with hostility that is uncalled for.  Throughout Bobbys response, he never once addressed the way his management acted and placed the entire blame on me and my boyfriend.  I can assure you I would not have made up that entire incident and as I have said before, I wished that this incident did not occur, but it did.  Again, if Steve had LET Chris show him the hair, they would have found it because we doubled checked before Chris brought it in.  Any retail store would not have their managers try to fight customers and treat customers with such disrespect.  In our first phone conversation, I explained to Bobby that I have been a customer at Dos for a few years and enjoyed their salmon burrito.  I also asked him if he could understand why I would not be returning to give them my business after this incident and he responded yes.  I do not want to step foot into an establishment where I am met with hostility, and that is why a certificate for another burrito would not suffice.  I do not think that Dos Coyotes did all that they could Âto try to make this problem right.  I think they did quite the opposite and made it worse. Users/AmyLee

Other things I dont understand are that if Chris was so customer
service oriented why would he be so rude and not understand how to
talk, listen and respect people? Why does Amy Lee feel the need to
drop the names of family friends such as Sharla Daly and Mike
Harrington? For the record, the refund was placed in the mail box on
Tuesday September 4th, 2007 for the Salmon Burrito. I am curious why
Amy hasnt posted that she received the refund, since I personally
signed it, addressed it, stamped it, and mailed it. In reflection, I
probably should have taken a video of the check, the addressed
envelope and me mailing it, the postmark and suchÂbut hindsight is
always clearer right? But most importantly, I am also disturbed that
Amy claims that I dont care about my Davis patrons  this is anything but true. If I didnt care, why was I personally taking her phone call on Friday evening of Labor Day weekend?

  Chris did try to talk and work out the situation, instead he was met by aggression from the manager Steve.  Why does Bobby not talk to his manager Steve about being rude, not understanding how to talk, listen and respect people?  I did not name drop any names, this is what I wrote: I actually called my friend Sharla Daly, who knows Bobby personally, to see if this is his normal treatment of customers or if he was just having a bad day. I decided to be the bigger person and not file further complaints with the city and health department, being considerate of my conversation with Sharla and the fact that everyone does have bad days.  The reason why I called Sharla was because I was extremely concerned by the way Bobby talked to me on the phone and the way his manager treated Chris.  Where  did I mention Mike Harrington?  Sharla is someone whos opinion and suggestions I trust.  I could have gone to the Better Business Bureau, Health Department, Davis Chamber of Commerce, to file complaints.  I didnt because Sharla took the time to talk to me about the situation and I took her advice to be the bigger person.  As I have stated before, I need to share my experience so others know what happened so that hopefully this manager Steve and  Dos Coyotes do not treat people this way anymore.   In regards to the check, I have not received it as of yet.  I have stated that I have no problem posting when I do receive the refund.  I will believe Bobby when I see the check.  Users/AmyLee

As a resident and business owner in Davis for the last eighteen years,
Dos Coyotes has probably given back more to this community than any
other restaurant in Davis. From everything from fireworks to benefits
were always trying to find ways to thank the people who support
us. The joke around town is that were the peoples nonprofit
restaurant. We were just at the Pence Gallery benefit last Saturday
night supporting the arts and on Thursday we will be serving food at
All Things Right and Relevant benefiting Yolo County Mental Health
Agencies. If anyone would like to talk to me about this incident or
anything else Ill be out at the event on Thursday or you can always
call the office (530.753.0202) Im pretty accessible. As far as the
comments as to whether Amy is a real person, I talked to her and she
exists! I promise that what I have written is the truth and not
exaggerated. If someone wants to pay, Id be more than willing to
subject myself to a lie detector test as to what I personally
experienced in this incident. Finally, I would like to thank those who
genuinely post their opinions about my restaurants  we take their concerns, complaints and praise into hand. Moreover, I would like to thank whoever recently edited the top of our page to include that we are not a Mexican or TexMex joint etc.

  I think its great that Dos Coyotes has given back to the community in Davis and I hope that they continue to do so.  I can promise too that I have written the truth and am not exaggerating.  I have not tried to manipulate the facts in my favor.  I think its great that Bobby is now thanking those who genuinely post their opinions about his restaurant, but this is definitely surprising to me after the way he bashed the DavisWiki in our first conversation.

  I felt the need to respond to the inconsistencies in Bobbys statement.  The Wiki is a great forum for exchange of thought.  Businesses should be respectful of individuals freedom to share their experiences and express their opinions.

20070920 09:02:32 nbsp Amy, youve made your point. You found a hair in your burrito and feel the service was extremely rude.  Can we drop it now? Users/jefftolentino

20070920 10:42:29 nbsp I think its time for Amylee to drop this conversation. I think its funny how Bobby is speaking for his manager(steve) and he was not there. But she keeps speaking on her boyfriends behalf and she was not their either. Drop it already. Please post if you have recieved your refund. Thank you  Users/exstudent



20070920 11:41:10 nbsp Thank you! This whole thing has been crazy! I am going there for lunch today and am looking forward to it! Users/MyaBrn

20070920 14:52:23 nbsp Oops, I should have explained that everything I wrote was Chris first hand account on the situation since he didnt feel the need to use another username.  I will gladly be done with this situation! I thought I was until someone kept trying to delete my original comment and anonymous users tried to refute my statement.  Ofcourse after I read Bobbys comment I had to respond to the inconsistencies.  Lesson learned! Have a recorder ready! hey I dont care if you eat at Dos, in fact I used to enjoy the salmon burrito. Just watch out for Steve, and I sincerely hope this situation never happens to anyone again. Users/AmyLee

20070920 17:52:02 nbsp Love Dos!! It is my favorite local place and has been for many years. Thanks for your polite comment on the whole hair thing Bobby Coyote.  Users/HeatherFlood

20070920 18:42:02 nbsp Hey All!  Ive been eating at Dos (South) since I moved to Davis and have always been welcomed with a smile by the cashiers.  Ive never had any real problems with the service, so I was surprised to read Amys epic account of a hair found in a burrito which somehow lead to threats and a police report... sounds like a good movie script... anyways!  Im glad Bobby shared with us the other side of the story that this comment page was lacking  and I think its funny that there was a discussion that heated on the daviswiki in which Ostrowski wasnt involved teehee.  Anyways  I just wanted to say that all of my encounters with the managers at Dos have been pleasant, and they always treat me above and beyond my expectations  especially Stephanie, who is always nice, and seems to go out of her way to say hi to me.  Thanks Dos!  I would recomend the navajo nachos :D Users/KyleRocks

20070922 16:28:54 nbsp Jesus H. Christ... this page has basically been ruined by hesaidshesaid garbage.  Why not move the controversy to its own page, i.e. Salmon Burrito Hair Incident Blown Completely Out of Proportion By Everyone Involved.
Re: Doss food:  Yeah its not gonna be everyones cupotea.  If you are looking for authentic or, God forbid, are from LA, you will not be pleased.  But if you are open to interesting, fresh interpretations of old classics, maybe give it a shot? Users/BillyBudd

Wow, reading through this entire post gave me brain damage. Amy, congratulations for wasting your time, your silly boyfriends time, and a restaurant owners time simultaneously. This was apparently the first time you ever received a hair in your food, so Ill explain what happens:

1) Humans cook your food.
2) Occasionally, one of said humans drops a single hair inside food.
3) If hair somehow causes grave illness, report it. Otherwise, pluck it out and calm down.

Just one gigantic he said/she said situation, amounting to nothing. You ALL could have resolved the issue much faster, but instead you let your emotions tie you down. And Bobby, you changed your entire familys name to Coyote to boost your restaurants franchise, so you should never talk. You have pretty good texmex food, though.

Chronoz, out!
