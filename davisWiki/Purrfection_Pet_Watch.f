20071016 19:37:46 nbsp Diane came over to take care of my dog while I was out of town for the weekend and I was very impressed with how thorough and professional she wasshe had thought of everything in advance (authorizations for emergency vet treatment, what kind of training you currently do with the dog, making sure I had arrived home even when it was late so that Judge wouldnt be left alone if my plane had been delayed, etc.) and had everything written down which reassured me it wouldnt be forgotten.  She even left a sweet note with how Judge did each day on her 2 visits & what they did.  I would recommed her to anyone who needs a pet sitter while going on vacation. Users/Judge
