Purves & Associates (pronounced PURviss) is the only familyowned independent insurance agency in Davis. As an independent insurance agency, agents at Purves shop for the most competitive policies among dozens of insurance providers. Unlike other agencies, there is no broker fee.

Purves & Associates just launched a large fundraising campaign for Davis school PTAs  http://www.youtube.com/watch?vPsGfeRAQcc watch the oneminute video here.

The Purves family has been in the insurance business in Davis since 1972 when George Purves joined Brinley’s Real Estate & Insurance. George bought the Insurance division from Mr. Brinley a few years later, and has operated continuously in Davis ever since. George’s sons Scott and Chris, who were raised in Davis, joined the Agency in the 1990s. Scott became president of the company in 2010.

A third generation of the Purves family is now going through the Davis school system, and the Purves agency sponsors many of their activities at Birch Lane Elementary, Holmes Jr. High and Davis High School, as well as various softball and soccer teams. In an effort to support local PTAs and charities, Purves & Associates is sponsoring a $25 donation per new policy to a number of local groups.

They have sponsored many local teams and events and have joined with Lyon Real Estate to support the UC Davis Childrens Hospital. They also helped fund local Malachi Daviss training http://www.davisenterprise.com/articles/2004/07/12/sports/175spt1.txt to qualify for the 2004 Olympics.

According to an http://www.sacbee.com/capitolandcalifornia/story/1390055.html article in the Sacramento Bee, Scott Purves, ..., said a protester carrying a sign reading Purves Family Supports Homophobia picketed his business Monday.

PTA Campaign
Purves & Associates Insurance Agency announced in late April that it is launching a campaign that has the potential to raise tens of thousands of dollars in donations to Davis school Parent Teacher Associations.

Purves & Associates, the only familyowned independent insurance agency in Davis, is seeking to write more home, auto and umbrella insurance policies. For each new policy written, Purves & Associates will donate $50 to the Davis school PTA of the policyholder’s choice.

There is no limit on the number of policies or donations made, so if a single individual were to buy new home, auto and umbrella insurance, Purves & Associates would make a $150 donation to the school PTA of that individual’s choice.

The policyholder does not have to live in Davis for the donation to be made, so Purves & Associates encourages families to contact friends and relatives in other cities and states so they can multiply the $50 donation even further.

“We attended Davis schools and so do our children,” said agency president Scott Purves, whose children attend Birch Lane Elementary. “We’ve always donated to local schools when asked. The big difference with our fundraiser is that we’re asking people to see if we can save them money on something that they’re already buying, and if we can, then we’ll donate to the schools on top of it. Everyone wins, and that’s a lot of fun.”

Note:
Purves & Associates Insurance Agency does not take a position on political issues, platforms, candidates or parties unless it is an issue related to insurance. However, the agency does encourage all of its employees to be active in the causes they believe in by exercising their First Amendment right to support those causes with their voices and contributions. Purves & Associates is an Equal Opportunity Employer.

20081107 10:27:31 	 After purchasing a home recently in Davis, I gave Purves a call to line up the necessary insurance.  They were easy to work with and quickly gave me a breakdown of rates from half a dozen different companies.  They were also great about working with a lender who needed everyone to jump through hoops (Getting a loan right now is no easy task).  Id recommend them to anyone needing help with insurance.
