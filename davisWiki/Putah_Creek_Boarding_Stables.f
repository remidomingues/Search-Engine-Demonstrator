Putah Creek Boarding Stable is located just south of campus on Old Davis Road, near the Center for Equine Health and the California Raptor Center, and right next to Putah Creek. It is the closest barn to campus UCD campus besides the Equestrian Center, accessible from campus by bike. Owner lives on site. It is a very laid back and friendly place with relatively few boarders. There is one main barn with stalls and attached paddocks for boarders, and four green irrigated pastures for daytime turnout. Stalls have mats and feeders. Horses are fed twice a day with oat hay and/or alfalfa (boarders choice). Horses can also be fed any feed the boarder would like to provide with a discount in rent.  Boarders are very friendly and helpful with little to no drama.  It a great place to enjoy the peaceful rural outdoors just a mile outside of downtown.



 There is one outdoor arena. It is a fairly large size, but it does not have all weather footing so it is quite muddy in the rainy season.  There is new fencing and lights.

The four green pastures stay irrigated year round, so there is always grazing space for your horse. Turnout is on a every other day rotation, so that every horse in the barn has a chance to be turned out. The is new pipe fencing on the pastures, which is very nice and reliable(and replaced very dangerous, sagging barbed wire).

There is an outdoor wash rack with mats, and a roundpen. The roundpen is useful for some basic training. There is also a large, locked tack room with lockable closets for each boarder that contain shelves and a saddle rack. The barn and the tack room are lit as well as the arena.

Rates are kept low by the selfservice mucking but is negotiable with an extra fee. You must muck your own stall, although pitchforks, wheel barrows and shavings are provided. Boarders are allotted a limited amount of shavings per week.

The management is very friendly and accommodating. Anything you need or want is welcome to be discussed, and the management will do their best to help.

For the most part, this seems to be a low riding stable. Some boarders ride on the trails or in the arena, but most ride only rarely or not at all. There are no jumps or poles for the arena, although there are a few barrels. There are no trainers or instructors on site, but the EQC is within riding distance.

Dogs are allowed as long as they dont bother any of the other animals or people, and rules are pretty lax as long as you are not being unsafe or obnoxious.

The barn is an old facility, so the structures are in a rather used condition. However, Currently, there are a lot of improvements happening at the barn, including new fencing, changes to the arena, and changes to the pasture. Look for more changes and improvements in the next several months.

20100825 23:30:23 nbsp How big are the stalls?
Also, is there the possibility of paying someone to muck for you if you cant make it out everyday? Users/AllisonFortis

Yes it is possible to pay someone to muck your stall Users/RyanDMiller

20110213 13:24:04 nbsp The stalls are on the mediumsmall size, kind of a tight fit for a thoroughbred or warmblood to lay down. But they have pretty large attached paddocks. Many of the boarders have arrangements with other boarders where they share stall cleaning duties (you muck 2 or 3 stalls one day, and they return the favor when you cant make it out) I dont think the management offers stall cleaning, even if you pay extra. Last time I called all their stalls were full. Users/chamomile
