20060328 My date and I ordered the Griddle Breakfast and the Ranchers Breakfast.  The latter came on three plates and the servings were generous!  I think that the toast should not have been already buttered.  The coffee was perfect, the servers were attentive and friendly, and the atmosphere was cozy and comfortable.  I highly recommend making the drive to this restaurant (and great date spot)!  Users/JennaChan
 Prebuttered toast is standard procedure at the majority of breakfast restaurants. Users/JustinCummins

20060801 20:04:49 nbsp great place to stop in for breakfast before heading to lake berryessa for the day Users/ShaunaMcKellar

20070608 08:21:30 nbsp the best place in yolo for diner comfort food.  Nothing was amazing, but there were generous portions for reasonable prices.  Their chili was pretty good but not great.  The beef open face sandwich was good but a little salty, and their pita sandwich was quite delicious.  The best part was the fries, crispy, and just the right salt/seasoning.  I wish they served breakfast the whole time they are open though.  Also get there early because things tend to run out Users/MattHh

20070619 10:05:58 nbsp Last place I ate in Davis, I now sadly know what I have been and will be missing out on. The food here was delicious, everything on the menu was tempting, everything I saw ordered looked excellent, and my meal was indeed tasty. I regret not getting the apple pie. The service here was attentive, always helpful, cheery and all that jazz. Reasonable prices, definitely a good place to bicycle to for a nice Sunday afternoon. Users/DavidPoole
 They do offer dinner specials, and I believe they are opened later twice a week, they have complicated hours, if someone could check it out, maybe go here for a delicious lunch and update this it would be nice. ~Dave

20070712 16:36:46 nbsp I finally got a chance to eat here and it was delicious.  It can be pricier for breakfast compared to Dennys, but the bacon is thicker cut, the eggs are perfect, and the portions are huge.   Users/RohiniJasavala

20070820 13:32:57 nbsp Not worth the drive. Users/JesseSingh

20071117 01:50:14 nbsp I had a pleasant breakfast here one weekday morning, but feel compelled to mention the little chunks of ham I found in my vegetarian omelette. I think I should have went for the pumpkin pancakes instead. Users/BrianLum

20080204 01:54:25 nbsp I went there a few weeks back and had the Putah Creek Scramble.  It was mighty tasty if I may say so.  The portion was a pretty good size even for a big guy like me.  I like the atmosphere too, having the regulars coming in and getting their usuals followed by the pleasantries with the staff was very smalltown nice.  Guy Fieri should visit this place on wiki:WikiPedia:Diners, DriveIns and Dives DD&D.  Users/DouglasPerera

20080330 00:38:40 nbsp This place is great for not only breakfast but lunch too! My favorite is the Buckhorn Farmers Market sandwich (which they serve at the Farmers Market in Davis) and the chicken tortilla soup.  Users/LizMelack

20080331 15:11:13 nbsp Stopped by there today for lunch. Nice menu selection, fresh ingredients, and pleasant small town feel.  Good service and while maybe a bit overpriced at $22 for lunch with just two meals and one soda, good food and service is well worth it.  Definitely will be visiting again. Users/loneshark

20081014 13:56:34 nbsp Totally worth the short drive to Winters.  Had breakfast there for the first time on Sunday.  It was fabulous.  Loved the diner feel.  And the food was scrumptious and very satisfying.  If you havent tried this place yet, do yourself a favor and make the trek out to Winters and try it.  You wont be disappointed.   Users/CurlyGirl26

20090111 18:39:27 nbsp Such an awesome place!  The pork tamales and fried eggs were out of this world!  We wanted to order everything on the menu and will definately be back. Fun bike ride from Davis gorgeous! Users/ruby18

20090111 20:04:27 nbsp Huge portions, great atmosphere, good food. I really like this place. I like most of Winters, in fact. Users/ChristyMarsden

20100810 13:31:58 nbsp Looks like they are going to be featured on Diners, Driveins and Dives with Guy Fieri!  According to the Bee Guy will be there sampling dishes on August 29th!  Pretty cool and worth the spotlight! Users/loneshark

20110531 21:11:05 nbsp Learned about this cafe from the Diners, Dive Ins and Dives. Not worth the one hour drive.  We got there 7:30 pm Sat night and we waited 30 minutes for a salty combo Italian pizza that was burned black on the edges. The cioppino was watery, the shrimp was tough and chewy,  one slice of salmon was the highlight of this dish...overall a lousy dish not worth $15. I had cioppino before and what they served me did not qualify as a cioppino...more like boiled seafood in tomato sauce. We complained to the manager about the slow service. She was nice enough to give us the the pizza for free but not enough to make us want to go back or tell our friends to eat there. Still wondering how this cafe got the rave review from the food network. Users/leochama53

20110710 10:17:30 nbsp After seeing, Diners, Dives and Dumps on the Food Network, I was stoked about trying Putah Creek’s cioppino.  We went early on a summer Saturday, sat outside (nice breeze but big mistake…we were bombarded by hoards of flies).  I’ve been to the cafe many times for breakfast (yum!) and lunch but never for dinner. Since it’s owned by the same people who own the Buckhorn (where I’ve never had a bad meal!), I was sure it would be a treat.  Wrong.
I had the cioppino and heirloom tomato salad.  My mate had paella and tortilla soup.  What a disappointment…  As stated, the cioppino broth was full of flavor with a little zing but it was served lukewarm. The fish and clams were dry. How can that happen in cioppino??  The two prawns were decent, as was the crab. But I had one little napkin and never offered anything else. How can you eat cioppino without making a mess?  The 4 small slices of heirloom tomato were not good …unripe, hard.  The buffalo mozzarella was excellent though (the best part of my meal) as well as the balsamic vinegar.  My husband’s tortilla soup was good but not outstanding.  His paella looked downright unappetizing with a driedout looking chicken/thigh on the top (also served lukewarm).  Luckily it didn’t taste as bad as it looked…but it was just ok.  When I went to wash off the cioppino mess in the restroom, it bordered on disgusting…paper all over the floor and no towels to dry off your hands. The waitress needed some serious training.  She removed the cork  from  a bottle of wine we ordered through the foil which she had only partially removed, never offered us to taste the wine  but immediately poured two full glasses. To top it all off, she gave us the check while I was still eating.  She never asked about dessert … not that we would have had any at that point.  Sadly, we’ll not return.

20130714 22:20:59 nbsp I heard some very good things from friends about Putah Creek Cafe, and I have to say I wasnt disappointed. Well, with the food anyway. It took around 35 minutes to get our food, which was way too long for me and my fiancee. (She wasnt blown away by the food). That long of a wait really put a damper on the whole experience. I understand that the kitchen is small, but a wait of that long is kind of ridiculous. We probably wont be back, Ill have to get my waffle fix someplace else.  Users/JamesKrause
