The Putah Creek Council, a nonprofit organizations nonprofit organization, helps protect Putah Creek through restoration projects, tree planting, biomonitoring, workshops, and other events.

Mission Statement:
 The Putah Creek Council is dedicated to the protection and enhancement of Putah Creek and its tributaries through advocacy, education and communitybased stewardship.

 We envision Putah Creek as a thriving corridor of native riparian and aquatic ecosystems connecting the Coast Ranges to the Sacramento River and the Delta. We envision a Putah Creek watershed community of people who value their creek and are committed to its stewardship.

On August 22, 2011, stream restoration work began in Winters Putah Creek Nature Park as part of the Lower Putah Creek Coordinating Committees largescale restoration of the entire creek. The project will change the shape of the channel, create floodplains and walking paths, and increase the ability of both humans and wildlife to enjoy and use this public space. http://www.davisenterprise.com/localnews/putahcreekrestorationprojectbeginsthismonth/ article.

  For reference for those following along, http://www.putahcreekcouncil.org/node/166 this article has a nice description of the history of changes to Putah Creek.  I dont get the sense that restoring the creek to its original creekbed is a realistic goal, as nice as it might sound, given that youd have to involve local farmers, the town of Davis, and UCD.   cp
   http://www.putahcreekcouncil.org/node/164 This article also seems to imply that the PCC will not be pursuing a return of Putah Creek to its original creekbed: Restoration can mean a lot of things: bringing something such as a landscape, a home, or a car back to its original glory. Restoration can also mean simply recreating functionlike restorative surgerywhere the outcomes are expected to be better than before intervention, but not in their original condition.  On Putah Creek restoration does not mean bringing the landscape or its vegetation back to a state of preEuropeansettlement, but rather improving its condition to where it can most effectively provide for the needs of the humans and wildlife that depend on it.  cp
