Part of http://putahcreek.ucdavis.edu Putah Creek Riparian Reserve, the Picnic Area is located on west campus on Levee Road, between Hopkins Road and Brooks Road.  Levee Road is often used by joggers and cyclists.  There are a few picnic tables which bring families and summer camp groups, (traditionally, the site for Camp Putah).  This is also a great birding location.  You can see all of Davis riparian associated species such as the Yellowbilled Magpie, the Western ScrubJay, nesting Raptors, Hummingbirds, Woodpeckers, Owls, a multitude of Little Brown Birds Passerines, and the adorable California Quail.
