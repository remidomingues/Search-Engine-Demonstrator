This is an eastwest County Roads county road that begins about seven miles to the west of Davis. Aptly named, the road follows the southern side of Putah Creek. At its end nearest Davis, Putah Creek Road begins just south of Stevenson Bridge at its intersection with Stevenson Bridge Road. From there, the road extends west towards Winters. Past Winters, Putah Creek Road continues along the south side of Lake Solano County Park Lake Solano, and it ends at Pleasants Valley Road.

Usage
Putah Creek Road is probably the most popular County Roads county road among the Bicycle Rides bikers due to the relative scenery and low traffic.

  Motor Traffic: low
  Accessibility: no shoulder

Notable Intersections
From west to east:
  Pleasants Valley Road: travel south to Vacaville, north to Lake Solano County Park and Lake Berryessa
  Railroad Avenue: travel north to Winters (bikers and pedestrians can cross the adjacent railroad bridge instead)
