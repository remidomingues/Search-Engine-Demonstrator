20130912 11:49:28 nbsp Went to South Fork today for first time.  Left confused.  The gate to the parking area was locked even though the sign listing the preserves hours stated it was open for use.  Had to park on side of road.  Could not find the north trail.  There is a permanent fence blocking off all access I could see running from the creek bank all the way to the levee.  There was also a temporary fence blocking off access part way down main loop by grassland.  (I am guessing this may be for the sheep, but there was no sign or anything to let me know when the path may be open again.)  The site looks like an awesome place to go birdwatching particularly along the riparian stretch, but I dont understand how I am to access it.  Can someone clue me in to what I must be missing?  Thanks! Users/KateGiorgi
