20070924 12:50:29 nbsp Actually, I would have no problem with the term genocide.  I modified that edit because of a long convoluted logic that didnt fit into the comment field.  Basically, the sentence is starting to become a list of what the subject isnt about rather than a list of what it is.  Imperialism isnt necessarily a matter of death (see the Pax Roman for an example of peaceful imperialism by force), but the way the US is in Iraq does relate to death issues.  Therefore, I didnt remove the whole thing (although I still think that as yet another what this subject isnt about, it probably should be), but I did remove the nonlife/death aspect of it (although in the case cited it does, in abstract imperialism does not necessarily involve killing and thus is not a trait that UCDSfL would be distinguished by not caring about).  Gah... I told you it was a bit convoluted.  Point is, the whole sentence is almost off the subject, and that part of it is yet farther astray, having nothing directly to do with the student group at UC Davis or their avowed purpose.  As I say, genocidedirectly with deathsemionsubject... so feel free to add genocide, although as I later posted to the talk page, the number of what it isnt about had exceeded the number of points they do have to do with, which is a distinct issue that I edited again to correct (edit 347).  In no way did I remove the single word because it was controversial... I remove it because it was too vague and wishywashy.  Genocide would have been better... but the whole thing did unbalance the sentence to a list of what they arent about rather than what they are.  You could fill books with issues of life and death that they arent about... veganism, hunting, gun control, chewing gum mortality rates, sanitation ethics, hygienic education, sex education, the effects of doorknob placement on a right handed majority versus left handed individuals.  Genocide would have been more onsubject, but still a list of stuff they arent about.  Users/JabberWokky

20080206 19:43:36 nbsp its sorta a double litmus test, you cant just run the string through a binary converter you have to do the math, and then you have to be able to interpret the meaning once you figure it out. As far as the binary goes, it should be in octets but this particular string is 9 digits in length... Just extrapolate, and sometime when I finally run into you in person I will do the math for you...

20080225 08:09:07 nbsp Hows that?  I understand that you bleed from your eyes when reading about them, but please give the organization the respect due any other community organization.  We all have groups we dislike or think are pointless or downright bad for society, but shouting them down is just poor form.  Theres plenty of room to give the entry room to say what they are and do, and then jump all over them like a rabid howler monkey with ebola. Users/JabberWokky

20080225 09:29:16 nbsp Hey pxl, just fyi, 12 step programs dont require a belief in a deity. Sure, these guys say the serenity prayer and refer to a higher power. The serenity prayer, though, still has plenty of meaning if you eliminate the deity part. Basically, its a reminder that stuff happens, some of it you can do something about, some of it you cant. It is good to know the difference between the two. Also, many people in AA who dont believe in a god refer to their sponsor as their higher power.

Oh, and see you at mass on Friday. Ill finally be in town for one again!

20100122 02:42:50 nbsp The wiki certainly doesnt have to be NPOV but similar tactics apply to getting your point out there in a way that is acceptable to other collaborators. I think it really does make more sense, tactically, to let people draw their own conclusions about some things, because they very likely dont have all the background info that you do. Meanwhile you and other wiki people with knowledge of the situation can fill that in and things will become more clear without saying explicitly what they mean. I think there is still room for that sort of interpretation, not necessarily as comments even, but it has to be written carefully because of the collaborative process. Users/NickSchmalenberger

I know I figured you had some sort of photo / video editing in on the Mac front. I just like to give you grief cause in the 90s M$ and Bill Gates were the evil empire and apple and Jobs were heroes. Now Apple is the evil empire and Gates is giving all his money to charity...
Life treats you okay?
