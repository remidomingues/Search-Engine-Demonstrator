As of March 4, 2013, Pyramid Alehouse in Sacramento has permanently closed its doors.


Happy Hours:
   Weekdays, 3:30pm5:30pm.  1/2 Price Appetizers and $3.30 pints, or $3.30 brewers rack.  (The rack is a better deal, because you can get a combined total of 30 oz. of beer.  You can also get a rack of the same beer, if you just ask for one kind.)

Pyramid Alehouse, Breweries Brewery & Restaurants Restaurant is located in Sacramento.  They offer a full lunch and dinner http://www.pyramidbrew.com/sites/default/files/CALPyramid_menu_web.pdf menu in addition to their selection of microbrews.  They make a great IPA, Thunderhead, and sometimes experiment with other IPAs thatll be on tap for a few months at a time.  Their Hefeweizen, recently dubbed Haywire Hefeweizen, is a delicious and very drinkable beer, and its also what they served in Quarks Bar in Vegas as Klingon Warnog Ale.  Pyramid is home to some of the best Chicken Wings in the area.

The location is very nice  its right next to the Crest Theater, and just up a nice walkway from the Capitol Parks Park.

Parking is available just across the street to the north, or in the Capitol garage at 10th and L.  Pyramid will validate your parking, although they sometimes run out of validations (they give out little validation cards, rather than simply scanning your parking card the way many downtown businesses do).


20100131 13:42:51 nbsp I had my wedding reception here.  It was absolutely fantastic!  I cant recommend this place enough.  Weve been going for years for food and drinks.  They have excellent beer and a nice, varied menu populated with tasty food.  The Sacramento Pyramid has a new chef as of a year or so ago, and hes made a few changes.  My old favorite, the Mediterranean Steak Flatbread, is gone from the menu.  They have fantastic pizzas, though, and the habanero barbecue sauce on their Pyramid Burger is to die for.  Sweet, spicy, and amazingly delicious.  For appetizers, try the chicken wings (heavenly!), the spicy spinach and artichoke dip that comes with excellent little crostinis, or the crispy onion strings, served with a smoky, tangy, spicy chipotle ketchup.
