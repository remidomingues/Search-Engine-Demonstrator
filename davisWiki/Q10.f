Pose what you feel is the most important question not asked here and answer it.


  Richard Harris:
  Bob Schelen: I have budget experience for the tough and challenging financial times ahead. I would like to see parity for career technical education and I would work to implement the Academic Achievement Gap Task Force recommendations sooner rather than later.  It is important the our decisions are studentcenters. That everything we do is for the creation of a successful student and one that will enjoy lifelong learning. We have a very good school district, but we can be even better.  With all that, I am running to represent the atrisk children and those in the middle that go either way. They can be successful or they can go down a wrong path. As the son of young widow, I particularly want to help those children succeed.

 Over 46 percent of our children nationally have engaged in some kind of selfharmful activity, be it cutting, drugs or alcohol abuse. Stress can affect children whether they are high achievers, in special education or are those children that are sometimes forgotten in the middle. A successful K12 proactive mental health program would be a benefit for them all.

 A mentor of mine once told me, the most important thing we can do on the face of this earth is the education of our children. It is preserving the future of the world. I truly believe that and want to be a part of the process.
