The City of Davis 2001 General Plan calls for the creation of a Youth Commission comprised primarily of youth to provide City Council guidance on issues that affect youths (http://www.city.davis.ca.us/pb/gp/ General Plan http://www.city.davis.ca.us/pb/gp/00510YouthandEducation.pdf Y&E 3.1a) Do you support the creation of this commission?  If so, what could you do to bring it to fruition?


  Ruth Asmundson: Davis Teen Center at 3rd and B provides ongoing activities for Davis teens that augment the many local athletic teams, and the activities at the three Davis high schools and junior highs. To date I have not noticed a high demand for a Youth commission.  Two years ago, as a member of the School Board/City Council 2x2 subcommittee, I recommended formation of such a commission but found no interest among high school and UCD students when the subcommittee met with them.

  Stan Forbes: Yes. I would ask Davis High and UCD Senate to appoint members.

  Lamar Heystek: Yes. My hometown of San Leandro has a Youth Advisory Commission and my twin brother is a past chair. I would vote to make Davis High Student Body President Tanvir Kapoor the first chair of such a commission, but hes off to UC Berkeley in the fall. I enjoy a good relationship with Davis High leaders such as Tanvir, so encouraging these leaders to sign and circulate a petition in favor of a youth commission would be my first step in making this a reality. I would also advocate for budgetary resources (staff time, etc.) and help identify potential members for a youth commission.

  Rob Roy: Current mayor Ruth Asmundson once told the ASUCD Senate that young people are more likely to have good ideas than older people. I think that a youth commission is a great idea. I would love to hear the input from the community that will inherit the Davis of the future. I would work with Schools and the youth in general to be sure this gets up off the ground.

  Michael Levy: If there was significant interest, I could certainly support it.  Presently, there are high school and UCD students on both the Human Relations Commission, and the CityUC Davis Student Liaison Commission. There are also UCD students on Social Services and the Bicycle Commissions.
