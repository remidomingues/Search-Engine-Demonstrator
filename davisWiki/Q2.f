What next for Valley Oak Elementary School Valley Oak, and what role does the DJUSD play?


  Richard Harris:
  Bob Schelen: I am a strong supporter of the Valley Oak Charter School. It would be a teachercoop and usually, teachers are skeptical of charter schools. Given their enthusiasm for this project, we could create a model for the state. If done correctly, a charter at Valley Oak can be a source of revenue for the School District.  The charter has to be approved by DJUSD and, although, there is less regulation at a charter, it is still overseen by the school district. There needs to be a school downtown if we want to attract young families to the area. The charter would be a excellent beginning for students that would want pursue technological education further at Da Vinci. The charter would need to attract students from outside the district, possibly UC employees with children and much of Spring Lake in Woodland was sold as close to the Davis school district.
