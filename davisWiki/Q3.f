What resources or expenditures do you favor CUTTING, in a situation in which revenues dont expand as fast as demands for them?


  Bob Schelen: All the programs in the Davis school district are good. Many already have been cut to the bone or eliminated. It is important that we pass Measure Q, all for Davis needs to vote for it, so that we can continue many of the programs that would be eliminated if it does not pass, programs that make Davis an unique school district. And I must mention that our most important education resource are our teachers.That being said, I cannot comment on specific programs at this time because of the uncertainty of the financial situation. What I can say is that I would work for the School District to adopt ZeroBased Budgeting where each year, each program, each job has to be justified as if it is just starting again for that year.  That would allow for transparency in the budget and give school board members a much clearer view of what is and is not working for the school district. It is sound financial practice that I have learned from my years of working with government budgets at all levels.
