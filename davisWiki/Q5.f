Do you believe Davis School for Independent Study should offer full UC A  G course offerings, and would you commit to funding that?


  Susan Lovenburg:
  Richard Harris:
  Bob Schelen: At this time, I believe it would be appropriate, given the right conditions, for the the Davis School for Independent Study to offer full UC AG offerings. I would also like to see the Davis School for Independent Study offer a complete Career Technical Education program as I believe there should be parity between Career Technical Education and University courses.  If the financial circumstances prove to be advantageous, I would like to see full funding fop such programs and I would work to see that it happens.  But, to be honest, if we are using the zerobased budgeting model, such a program and a proposal for funding it would need to come to the Board for justification.
