Do you believe Davis School for Independent Study should offer full UC A  G course offerings, and would you commit to funding that?


  Richard Harris:
  Bob Schelen: In my walking and talking with voters, I have found that many Da Vinci students would like to see their own identity as a school and are concerned with being in portables and overcrowding. However, there are some advantages to being near campus. I am sure much, although not completely similar, is happening in regards to the Davis for Independent Study program and its identity. Those discussions need to continue happening, but with the information I have at this point, my answer would be yes, if financially feasible and there is a change in its present location.
