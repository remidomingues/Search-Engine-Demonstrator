What do you believe is the best use for the district building on B Street (current DJUSD headquarters and DSIS site)?


  Joe Spector:
  Susan Lovenburg:
  Richard Harris:
  Bob Schelen: At this time, I believe the School District and the community is best served by the district building continuing to serve as the district building,  though there may need to be some renovation and modernization. I believe it is an asset to be downtown and next to city hall for a variety of reasons.
