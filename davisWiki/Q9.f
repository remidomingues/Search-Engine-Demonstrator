Are you in favor of zero tolerance policies?

  Bob Schelen: Difficult question. We all have heard the stories of students being expelled because they brought a knife or a fork to school. However, if a student endangers the lives of themselves or others by bringing a loaded weapon onto a campus, does that student have the right to participate again? And what about rehabilitation. Are we to say that a student that has problems cannot change.  I cannot answer this yes or no. I would have to say it depends on the circumstances, so by that definition, it would be no, but there are times when an activity is so egregious that the possibility of it happening again cannot be tolerated. I would hope that by developing and pursuing the proactive K12 mental health program that I have proposed using existing state monies that the need for zerotolerance policies would lessen and students would be free to express themselves in a healthy manner and in an safe environment. Gosh, I hope that answers the question.
