The Unitrans P & Q Bus Lines are the counterclockwise (P) and clockwise (Q) loops that encompass most of the town. The lines pass by almost every major Shopping Centers shopping center and numerous Apartments apartment complexes. Most of the town is within a short walking distance from a P/Q bus stop. In addition, the P and Q lines are the most expensive weekday Unitrans routes to operate due to their long routes.

All P & Q Lines no longer serve Loyola Drive, continuing straight on Covell Blvd.  Look for the L Bus Line for service to Loyola Drive Loyola, Tulip Lane Tulip, Temple Drive Temple, and Monarch Lane Monarch areas.

The lines also run on weekends. Check out the schedule and route map at the http://www.unitrans.ucdavis.edu/p Unitrans website  P or http://www.unitrans.ucdavis.edu/q Unitrans website  Q for more information.

This route seems to be very popular among the townfolk, due to the wide coverage. Don’t forget to yield the front seats to senior citizens!

These routes also have tripper buses during peak hours. The P tripper starts at Anderson and Hanover and the Q tripper at Cowell and Pole Line. To avoid being late, the P tripper turns into the K (ArlingtonHumboldtArthur instead of ArlingtonRussell).
