Quail Ridge Wilderness Conservancy lies on a peninsula at the southwest end of Lake Berryessa, in Napa County.  It is home to a wide variety of flora and fauna native to Californias Inner Coast Range.  The reserves website indicates it is home to black oak, blue oak, interior live oak, oracle oak, scrub oak, and valley oak, as well as about 15 different species of bunchgrasses that are quite rare todayincluding Californias state grass (as of January 1, 2005), nassella pulchra, or Purple Needlegrass.  As a relatively pristine wilderness reserve, it is studied by biologists and ecologists.  It is one of 36 http://nrs.ucdavis.edu/ natural reserves operated by the University of California.  Three webcams look out over different parts of the reserve and can be viewed from the link above.  They also have several informational videos, listed on their main website.
