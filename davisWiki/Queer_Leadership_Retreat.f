The Queer Leadership Retreat (QLR) is a student retreat organized by the UC Davis Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Resource Center.  The first annual QLR was planned for January of 2010 and has been rescheduled for April of 2010 due to inclement weather at the retreat site.

Some of the objectives of the Queer Leadership Retreat include:

  Empowering LGBTIQ students
  Building community
  Providing a safe space for students to develop leadership skills
  Developing strategies for consciousnessraising within our various communities
  Setting community goals
  Educating ourselves and raising awareness about issues w/in the community

The retreat will include workshops and teambuilding activities, as well as academic resources and an alumni panel. The retreat will provide a unique opportunity for students to network, learn, and share their own knowledge and experiences. We hope that you can take part in planning the retreat and/or by attending either as a facilitator or participant.
