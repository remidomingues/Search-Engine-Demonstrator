 QUEER STUDENT UNION AT UC DAVIS


 Current Information Regarding the QSU

QSU is a nonprofit student organization that has had an unsteady history on this campus for decades, with various revivals and hiatuss. As of Winter quarter 2012 the QSU has been actively holding meetings and planning different types of events. All of our events are open to the community, to get involved please email qsu.ucdavis@gmail.com to get on the listserv or check out the facebook group http://www.facebook.com/groups/112700412128857/. The QSU is open to all students, graduate and undergraduate, as well as community members. Our goal is to challenge norms of all kinds, discrimination against all people, and to serve as a safe space for LGBTQIAPAlphabetSoup identifying individuals.


The working mission statement of QSU reads:

“The Queer Student Union’s goal is to contribute to the queer community at UC Davis. We aim to provide an additional resource that contributes to and brings together the already existing network of queer organizations on campus through social events, community networking opportunities, and participating in community activism. We are open to people of all creeds and identities because we believe that developing bonds and friendships is crucial to building community.”

Aside from meeting every week, we have a multitude of events that we put on. These include:

Queers on the Quad: Held every Wednesday at the MU Quad from noon till people want to leave and is a space to hang out in the sun with queers and their peers (snacks will be provided!)
Dance PartyFundraisers
Queer Potlucks

Just to name a few; we are always looking for new ideas, so if you are interested in putting on an event that you think would coincide with QSU shoot us an email. Also check out our facebook page to get involved and hear about different events that would be going on. Please, dont hesitate to get involved, all are welcome!

 HISTORY OF THE QSU AND NONCURRENT INFORMATION

Queer Student Union or QSU has been around for decades, but has been in a constant state of flux for most of its existence.  Its Working Mission Statement says:

The Queer Student Union’s goal is to contribute to the queer community at UC Davis. We aim to provide an additional resource that contributes to and brings together the already existing network of queer organizations on campus through social events, community networking opportunities, and participating in community activism. We believe that developing bonds and friendships is crucial to building community.

In the Summer of 2003 five students, Dan Reilly, Users/JonDsouza Jonathan Dsouza, Brenna Langstaff, Kim Woods, and Aldrich Tan, sought to resurrect the organization to help bridge the gap between the splintered queer communities on campus. The group put on a few well attended and well received programs, including a Queer Prom featuring Pansy Division.

QSU reactivated briefly with a handful of meetings and events in the 20052006 school year, when it was picked up (with some controversy) by officers Lisa Guernsey, Users/MarionEveridge, Mihn Phran, and Eric Sneathen, all of whom have since graduated.

In 2007 (the last active year until 20102011) the officers were as follows:
Grant Schoonover CoCoordinator
Steve Cha CoCoordinator
Eric Chau Publicity Chair
Aeron Terry Social Chair
Lee Grino Treasurer


QSU REVIVAL

At the end of Fall quarter, 2010, a group of students began attempts to revive the QSU in efforts to bring the many queer students groups together as a unified whole.

During Winter Quarter 2011, the UC Davis Queer Student Union became an official student organization through the UC Davis Center for Student Involvement. Throughout the quarter, QSU met weekly on campus to discuss topics relevant to the attendees and their lives. QSU has recently hosted a few events  namely bake sales on campus and dance parties off campus. QSU also sent a delegation of 60 people to Western Regional, an annual LGBTQIA conference for people of high school age and older. This years conference theme was Unchecked Boxes: Faces behind the Labels (http://www.comeoutwest.org).


Bake sale for QSU. Winter quarter 2011.


Listed below are a few of the officers for the organization as of the end of winter quarter. They will likely change during spring quarter:
• Cochair Miguel Espinoza
• Publicity Chair Andrew Mojarro
• Recorder Christina Platenkamp
• Social chair Kelsey Walling

Coordinators for the Queer Student Union expect to hold weekly meetings in the spring. For more information, you can go to the facebook page or receive updates by email. To request to be added to the email list, contact one of the officers.

SPRING 2011
The Queer Student Union will be holding meetings every Monday at 6pm. For more information, contact one of the officers.

WINTER 2012
Im excited to announce that QSU is coming back this winter! The plan right now is to create a chill space for LGBTQIA identifying students to come together and get to know one another. Weve talked about having like a game night/hang out space for two hours every other week, and having discussion spaces on the alternate weeks. (I want to do the Queerness and Privilege workshop during the first discussion meeting if yall are down. This would probably be during the second QSU meeting for this quarter. Might be a bit revised from the one presented at the Student of Color Conference.)

We are planning on having meetings Tuesday nights from 68pm. Location TBA. The first meeting is tentatively scheduled for Tuesday, January 31st.
MORE UPDATES TO COME SOON!

::UPDATE::
The first Queer Student Union meeting of this quarter will be held Tuesday, February 7th from 68pm: GAMES, FOOD, MUSIC.

We are not planning on having any kind of formal group discussion at this meeting, but rather we will be encouraged to have conversations in smaller groups about our hopes for the student union.

After considering the conversations weve had with folks last quarter and results from the survey last spring, we are planning on having game nights/socializing every other week and more formal discussions on the alternate Tuesdays of the month.
