The Quick Shop Market is your general 711 esq. Convenience Stores convenience store. They sell wine, beer, hard alcohol, snackfood, bathroom necessities, Smokers cigarettes and other general merchandise. Ive also noticed Bros buying Kegs kegs on the weekends. Its right across Pole Line Road from the Davis Cemetery.

Their periodicals are limited solely to pornography; if you cant find your barely legal pics anywhere else, you can probably find it here.

  Quick Shop Market has the cheapest kegs in town. Although Aggie Liquor has a better selection.  Users/RobRoy
  They also sell two blunts for a dollar, by far the best deal in town.  Users/DanMasiel
  Interesting trivia: the ATMs ATM here has a dialup modem, its probably one of the last places youll be able to hear that boinging sound. Users/AmeliaCarlson aec

A kegs keg of Natty Lite/Ice or Bud/Lite will cost you $74.99+tax.
