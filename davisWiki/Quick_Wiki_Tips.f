   Remember:  We dont all share the same perspective!  Lets keep the wiki useful for all members of the Davis community.
   The Davis Wiki spell check isnt so great.  Most modern browsers (like http://www.google.com/chrome/ Chrome, http://getfirefox.com Firefox, http://www.apple.com/safari/ Safari, and http://www.konqueror.org/ Konqueror) have builtin spell checkers to underline misspelled words.
   Spending too much time on the wiki?  Engaging in pointless edit wars?  Get out from behind the computer and Wiki World Travelers experience the rest of the world!
   Work together with other editors on the Collaboration of the Month.
   The wiki is not a weapon. Please dont use it solely for the purpose of making negative comments about people or organizations. Conversely, dont use it to just praise stuff. The community benefits most when you include the good as well as the bad.

   Be kind to the longtime editors! They need regular encouragement.
