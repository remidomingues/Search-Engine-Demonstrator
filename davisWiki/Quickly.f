Quickly sells tapioca drinks as well as some food items, much like Old Teahouse or any other tapioca drink place in California. It was formerly the North Davis location of Great Clips.

They are currently (as of May 2012) offering these 6 drinks for special price: Black Tea, Jasmine Green Tea, Milk Black Tea, Jasmine Milk Green Tea, Thai Milk Tea, and Taro Milk Tea. Specials change every 2 weeks; tapioca (commonly referred to as pearls or boba) can be added for $0.50.

Quickly is a franchise. Each Quickly store is owned by a local owner. The owners pay to use the Quickly products and pay a percentage of profits to Quickly. The store used to be owned by the person who owned the local franchise of Ohana Hawaiian BBQ, however the Davis Quickly store was sold to a new owner.

 History 


As a grand opening special, they offered four different teas for $0.99: Black Tea, Black Milk Tea, Jasmine Green Tea, and Jasmine Green Milk Tea.  The store no longer sells frozen yogurt. There were two Quickly/Menu flavors of selfserve yogurt along with a few toppings.  Their frozen yogurt may well have been the least expensive in Davis.



20081025 17:55:25 nbsp Just got my drink from here, kiwi slush with aloe added, pretty good. It was a little crowded since today was grand opening and there were lots of people just hanging out inside and outside, price ranges from $2.50 to $5.00+ depending what youre adding :) Users/flamecrow

20081025 20:46:04 nbsp menu looks like standard tap ex flair but Im still down to give it a whirl Users/StevenDaubert

20081027 00:00:54 nbsp My first was the Mango Slush. Most places I go to seem to use the champagne or manila type mangoes... which make it really sweet. But ... damn, it tasted like a Mangoagogo from Jamba Juice. TRYYY ITTTTTTT !  Users/tila2killya

20081028 12:02:26 nbsp As long as Im not forced to give my business to Old Tea House, Ill be happy.   Users/metal.lace

20081028 13:13:27 nbsp Wow! They had grand opening special where their black milk tea was only a dollar, and it was awesome! Im so glad we have something like this in Davis (and within walking distance of me). My only wish is that it wasnt cash only :( Users/ascapoccia

20081028 16:24:20 nbsp Tastes better than OTH although prices are along the same lines as OTH.  The color and design of this building is nice.  However, the location of the cash register causes a massive blockage at the door.  Grand opening prices for the drinks are pretty damn nice.     Users/BenLee

20081028 16:56:21 nbsp Ive been to it, although I havent ordered something from it yet.  Very much like Old Teahouse, but there were actually places to sit!  The line was very long.   Users/IDoNotExist

20081029 17:53:23 nbsp Hasnt ANYONE noticed the extraordinary number of flies on the ceiling?  While waiting for my drinks today I started counting and came to #127 flies on the wall/ceiling in the dining area.  Flies were crawling all over the yogurt toppings bar as well(cringe...) I was initially excited to try their yogurt/toppings but Ill be avoiding it unless the owners of Quickly cleans up the flies.  Their food items are quite tasty and remind me of Old Teahouse...however the flies need to go!!! Users/Magster

20081029 18:54:42 nbsp Their crispy popcorn chicken is significantly better than Old Teahouses. That being said, I spent 15 minutes waiting for it to get to me, only to find that one of the employees had bumped her friends ticket, so that they got it instead of me. I then had to wait a further fifteen minutes. As I said: its good, but if I have to wait half an hour to get it, I dont think Ill be seeing that much of Quickly. Users/JoePomidor

20081029 19:48:36 nbsp When I went today it was really busy, the line extended beyond the door.(Dont be in here if there is a fire, youll never escape!) My only complaint is the rudeness he guy at the register with an Ohanas shirt(the owner I guess) was barking money, money! and snatched the cash out of my friends hand before he was told how much to pay. Aside from the free toppings for the $.25/oz yogurt I dont see much of a difference in quality from old tea house. Ill keep coming while the prices are low, but when it does I am going back to OTH. Users/AmyTrinh AmyT

20081029 22:42:58 nbsp Same here. Speaking of that rude Owner, I went in there with a few of my girlfriends and the way he stare at us was very disturbing. Will only go if hes not around. Users/AvilaVoom

20081030 21:29:16 nbsp Ive been here three times already.  First was during the day, and service was fast but the black milk tea tasted a little off.  The second time I was there, the line went out the door, and they were painfully slow considering the fact that they had 6 people out front and 3 in the back.  The last time was the worst.  We waited FOREVER for the drinks, and our food came out before the drinks.  When we ordered, we had asked for a large cup for the green apple rose tea, the girl forgot to input large, and when we realized that 2 minutes after we ordered, we told her, at which point she said that it was too late to change it, the drink was already made.  Funny how the drinks werent called until 15 minutes later.  I had ordered small pearls in my drink, and boy did they skimp on it.  There were no pearls left after my first sip.  Im guessing they were running out?  As for the food, the popcorn chicken had pretty much no meat, and my friend lobster balls came out frozen.  I told the guy in the Ohana shirt (Im guessing hes the owner), and he just scowled at me and took it back.  I didnt even get a simple sorry about that.  Then I felt really bad because that guy yelled at the cook in the back (which he shouldnt because he was the one that rushed my order in the first place).

Also, why are there ONLY chinese people working here?  Talk about job discrimination.  Their job application asks you if you speak mandarin or chinese

When I looked up one time while waiting for my drinks, I thought that the ceiling had polka dots.  Well... its not polka dots.  Theyre flies.

Needless to say, once their $.99 drinks end, I will no longer be coming by. We seriously need better options than quickly and Old Teahouse OTH in Davis. Users/JennPham

Add: I went back today on 11/4 and this time they forgot my pearls. (  too bad i didnt realize that til I got home since the pearls were supposed to be in black tea.  The fly problem is a little better, now the ceiling only looks half polka dotted.  Also, I saw them skimp out on some poor guys onion rings.. He got like three tiny little pieces, it was pretty sad to look at.
 The application probably asks if you speak Chinese because the menus are in Chinese and English. Users/NickSchmalenberger

 Yeah... most places with multilingual menus give preference to those who speak the language. Youll often see this at Chinese/Vietnamese restaurants as well. Users/KellyM

20081031 00:03:28 nbsp It was really crowded today, plus the cashier had absolutely NO idea what she was doing. Why hasnt the management trained their workers so theyd at least do the simple things right. All that mess along with bad attitude really put me off after waiting for 50 minutes in the line. Doubt Ill come again. Users/ty55
 Why would you wait in line for 50 minutes at a place  called Quickly?

20081031 00:22:56 nbsp I came here a few nights ago around 22:30 and the line was too long so I left. I probably wont go here at all unless the line is less than halfway to the door. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20081031 12:10:32 nbsp Hey, I work @ quickly and Im sad to see the number of dissatisfied customers on here. I hope you guys accept our apology, but please understand that we have just opened and we were put on the spot with so many customers to serve. But given time, we will start to get accustomed to the many variations of drinks we have to make. As for the flies, we hate them as much as you do, and were trying to figure out a way to get rid of them. And regarding the service, I cant speak for all my coworkers, but I try my best to put on a friendly face and provide good customer service. But it is something that should be brought up with everyone who works there. Again, please accept our apology and perhaps give us another chance in the future :)  Users/jfong252

20081101 11:53:32 nbsp I dont even know where to begin with how disappointed I am to see people complaining already  they JUST opened, what, a week ago? Cut them a little slack until things settle down, and realize that their lines are probably really long because 1) the employees havent had the practice to provide you with automated behavior and 2) a lot of customers are visiting a new place. Geez.

Moving on, my experiences have been pretty good. The first time I went was with a couple of friends, and I ordered a jasmine green tea, which was sweeter than I would have preferred. When I went by myself a second time and ordered the same drink in a large cup, it was much less sweeter than I expected (probably primed by my first drink). My third and most recent visit was surprisingly crowded for a midnight on Thursday. (Or maybe I dont get out much?) My friend and I had each ordered two drinks, and though she was right after me, we waited maybe 1015 minutes but never heard her number called. We were going to wait until 275 before asking, but one of the employees noticed us before it got to that point and asked what her number was and immediately set to fulfilling her order. So Im pretty pleased that the employees have been friendly and courteous in spite of the stress of handling so many people. :)

Im not super critical about food, so a capacityrelated thing I really love about Quickly is how much more SPACIOUS it feels compared to Old Tea House. Its definitely a plus that its closer to where I live too. Its too bad about the abundance of flies though, and hopefully thatll be resolved soon, in a food establishment. Is it fly season or something? My generally decent apartment has had a strange upsurge of them in the past week when before, we had none.

I am wondering, however, about their caramel snow drink. Id never had it before and that was the last thing I ordered. It wasnt bad, but mine was very strongly coffeeflavored, which makes me wonder what the caramel coffee snow is like... Users/AmyChow
  My main complaint isnt about how long it takes for the food to be prepared, its that the people who work there bumped their friends up in line. I had to wait twice as long just so someones friend could get their popcorn chicken before me. I think thats a crap way to runa  business. Users/JoePomidor

20081101 20:30:17 nbsp Quickly: FlyCity USA?

My girlfriend and I noticed that Quickly just opened by our favorite chinese place stopped in for some tea.  Things were going well until she pointed out the fly paper trap on the counter back where the tea was being prepared which was coated in flies ... then we noticed the ceiling.  I have never seen so many flies before, and this place opened a week ago?  The scary part is that they all look like small, baby flies; meaning theyre coming from somewhere in Quickly ... ewwwww!

It pains me to be harsh on a place that just openedup, but they have a serious health issue that needs to be addressed, quickly!   Users/VladLoscutoff

20081102 18:24:28 nbsp Apparently, they were meant to open up 2 weeks earlier than they did, but didnt pass any of the health regulations!! EW.

Regardless, I decided to try and give them a chance, so I walked in this afternoon to check it out.
I was one of 3 customers, and it took them 15 minutes to make my blueberry slush; which, was essentially huge chunks of ice and bad syrupy flavoring.

Probably wont be stopping by anytime soon again... :/ too bad, since its so close to where I live! Users/whatheFUNK

20081104 02:15:50 nbsp i got so owned trying to get food there twice!

proportions are waayyy too small for the price, and theyre just mediocre foods. the sweet potatoe fries tasted like oily regular fries, the were 5 small pieces of calimari in the whole container, the bento box had 3 small pieces of meat and a lot of rice. yea. i think if the 99 cent drink special stops id probably go to old tea instead.  Users/bambam

20081104 11:46:28 nbsp I went back again and the FLY issue has improved drasticallyI still counted about 16 flies roaming around but significantly better.  I hope they keep the 99 cent milk tea specialthat is the only thing making me return to this place. Users/Magster

20081104 16:00:12 nbsp why do they have to copy ots food menu and make the food sooooooooo much worse than ots?guess the owners just dying to make money without thinking too much and long. Users/dd

 Most Pearl Tea/Boba places in California have very similar menus... as for food quality, I never understood why people ordered food at these tapioca drink places. Users/KellyM

20081105 17:20:58 nbsp Hi everyone, i am also an employee @ Quickly, and i just want to take this opportunity to summarize all the complaints weve had thus far and try to explain some of the problems and also forward these complaints to the manager of the place. From the look of things, our main complaints falls under the category of:

1) Wait Time
2) Sanitation problems (flies)
3) Low efficiency of workers
4) Quality and portion of the food
5) Employees bias towards their friends
and lastly, a small (but oh so funny) problem of the owners staring at customers.

1) Regarding wait time, i want everyone to rest assured that everyone @ Quickly is aware of the problem, even the employees. But the truth is, theres nothing we can do about the speed of food as they are managed by the kitchen. The manager has already told the kitchen to speed things up, and even though quickly is technically a fast food restaurant, our cooks all have normal sitin restaurant experience so i can assure you that the food provided for all of our customers are restaurant quality, and as most of you may know, restaurants dont make 10 minute dinners. Regarding drinks, i can promise that all of our employees are working their hardest, and those that are just not fast enough has already been let go (kinda mean, but its true). We just opened up and most of our employees didnt receive training until one day before Opening, so it might take them a bit longer to get use to the recipe for each drink as well as the location for the ingredients. Im happy tell you guys that all of us employed at Quickly are improving in speed, and its only a matter of time before everyone can make say... 4 drinks at once.

2) Now the fly problem is a situation we are ALL annoyed by. Trust me, as an employee, i hate flies flying around me as much as any customer, and personally im not a bug guy, so ive told the manager time and time again to take care of this problem. We already have 1 small fly zapper in the restaurant by the door (its a blue, lamplooking thing to the right of the door near the ceiling) and 2 fly zappers in the back kitchen. The manager has also ordered a large Ohanasized fly zapper waiting to be delivered, so im certain the fly problem will go away soon. Meanwhile, please be patient and let our temporary fly trapping pink sticks do their job~ lol

3) Like i said before, all the employee speeds are increasing as they accumulate more experience and speed WILL pick up, i promise you this.

4) Quality of food personally to me isnt a big problem. Personally i find all the food (not snacks) ive eaten in Quickly so far to be pretty good, but the snacks....yeah well... theyre not very big (we employees as well as you customers already know). I also dont think its fair that 6 pieces of calimari rings cost 3.50 (or something like that), and i also hope the manager will either increase the portion or decrease the price asap. So for now, why dont everyone just stick to actual food items and popcorn chicken~ their portion is still pretty good.

5) Now THIS problem is a problem i havent seen yet, and i am just as surprised as JoePomidor that this is happening. This is definitly not fair and shouldnt happen EVER. We as employees are suppose to follow the number of the drinks as they are printed out on the receipts at all times. There are no special discounts or lines for employees friends, as a matter of fact there arent even special discounts for employees who are not working. Even us employees have to wait in line just like regular customers when we are not working, as well as pay regular price. If anyone ever see employees bumping their friends up the line, please remember the day of the week as well as time of the day down and notify Quickly, the employee will be punished as see fit by the manager.

This last problem...... i actually dont know what to say. As a guy, of course i never have this problem lol, but im pretty sure hes not doing this on purpose to freak the customers out. His english is not the best so... maybe hes trying to be friendly in his own way.... hahahaha but yeah, seriously, dont think about it too much, he is NOT going to come up to you and ask for your number or follow u home.  Users/TimW

20081106 02:36:09 nbsp i ordered the fried turnip cake, they just give me 4 uncut pecices which is different than the quicklys in the bay. the quickly in the bay cut them in small chuncks and the portion is way biggeer than the quickly in davis. Also one of the employees face is always red which means he is drinking all the time during work?? lol not just one day, but several dayss. so lol. dont know what else to say  Users/OCG

20081106 21:17:53 nbsp I have to say quicklys at other places are way much better than this one.  Users/Desmond

20081110 00:24:22 nbsp I went there on saturday night and the service was really good.  There was a line when I walked in but my drinks came out really quickly and the workers were both pretty friendly. I ordered a quickly special and the waiting time food was about 15 minutes.  Users/kkash

20081110 12:06:53 nbsp had some fried chicken, which would be the main item I would patronize quickly for, it was respectable.

Hopefully they will iron out the kinks and improve over time! Users/StevenDaubert

20081111 10:25:39 nbsp I’ve been here twice, and I can say that I will never go back again. There’s many reasons why, but there’s two BIG reasons.
The owner manager, which I think is also the same guy at the Ohana BBQ place, is just very creepy. Every time I walk in, he stares at me, which would make any girl uncomfortable. But the fact that he doesn’t just stare at my face is what gets me even more disturbed.  Many of my own girlfriends have been here before, and they told me they experienced the same thing. Blank stares for like 30 seconds from that guy. I have had it! I’ve never been that uncomfortable in any restaurant before. I don’t care if sometimes the Teahouse takes a bit longer for my drinks and food, I’d rather go there than to deal with that creepy tall guy.
The drinks and food is what makes me want to stay away from this place. I ordered a strawberry tea drink, and it tasted awful. It tasted like there was no tea inside, just flavor powder and water.  I ordered the crispy chicken as well and it tasted grainy. I mean it hardly had any chicken in the pieces, just batter mostly. This was my first experience. Despite everything, knowing that I went during the first few days of grand opening, I decided to give them another try, thinking that being open for almost 2 weeks perhaps the first experience was just a small mishap. I went there the second time, and ordered the snow bubble drink, and it took them almost 20 minutes to make. I was clearly ahead of at least 5 customers, but I saw that the employees skipped my ticket to give priority to their friends. That made me upset…When I got my drink finally, I took a sip and It tasted even worse than the strawberry tea drink I ordered the first time. It was bland and had no creamy taste at all. Chunks of ice that were not blended at all!

Avoid this place!!! Service is bad, drinks are BAD and Food is Bad! The only good place in this plaza is sushi unlimited and Albertsons and occasional McDonalds.
 Users/SarahLee

20081111 10:52:22 nbsp This place sucks... I went to get a Milk tea w/ tapioca (like the easiest thing to make other that a milk tea w/o tapioca) while my wife and kids went to Guad next door.  It took over 15 mins to get my drink.  No one had ordered anything and my drink was just sitting in their lid sealer forever.  My family had already finished 1/2 of their meal by the time I got it and the ice had melted and made the drink too watery (ugh). Go to OTH way better Users/Aaron.Curtin

20081113 18:27:32 nbsp I had a rose tea with pearls and some other jelly stuff and somehow it ended up costing me almost 4 dollars!!! I don’t know what rose tea is suppose to taste like, but it tastes like crap and way too expensive.

But on a side note, I noticed that the tall Ohana BBQ guy is the manager of this place.  I don’t think I want to be going here anymore. I was at Ohana BBQ last year when they first opened and witnessed that same tall Ohana guy make a smoothie and spill it all over the counter and then scoop the smoothie with his hands back into the cup and reblend it and gave it to a customer. Someone else wrote about this too, read Ohana BBQ daviswiki page. If he is running this place, I would be very cautious of how they make their drinks. And I also agree with Sarahlee he always stares at people in a very shady manner.
 Users/LynnM

20081114 22:29:46 nbsp I recently visited the Quickly in sacramento and it is TOTALLY DIFFERENT!! There menu might not be as big but they still have the normal good stuff like the popcorn chicken and the fried calamari. hahaha...by the way they have fried fish balls and 10 of them for only 2.99. The owner there is really nice and i always seem to see them around. The service their is great and i got my food in less than 5 minutes.The employees there were also very friendly and greeted me as i walked in. :D My friend got a regular milk tea with boba (and i had a sip) and it was great. The boba was the exact chewyness and the milk tea was really OUT THERE. The taste was totally there. refreshing, yummy, and SWEET!!Sadly,the Quickly in sacramento does not open as late as the Quickly in davis,but they do open til 11 on fridays and saturdays. sOOOOO.. if you ever have a chance to visit sacramento you SHOULD stop by. It is located on 16th and U street. Well..then..hope this review helps you ...  Users/angelyu

20081115 00:15:21 nbsp Personally, I am not a big fan of tapioca drinks. Since everyone is talking about Quickly, so I came by and give it a try. I ordered their grand opening special Jasmine milk green tea w/ large tapioca. I waited for like 10 minutes in line and like another 10 minutes for the drink. Heres my comment on the drink:

  not enough ice
  bland taste
  tapioca way too soft

To sum it up, the drink is not worth my wait nor my money. This place needs to kick it up a notch before Id come back and give it another try. Users/T.CHOW

20081118 23:33:21 nbsp Well, I tried going here again. I waited twenty minutes in line (at 10:30pm) in order to get to the cashier, where I placed my order. Then I handed her my $20 bill. At this point, she rubbed it a bit, looked at it, then carried it over to the other employee who was working the drinks machine. They conferred, and she came back and informed me that my bill didnt feel real. She then asked if I had any other bills, which I did not. Her suggestion was that I go next door and use the ATM. I was not exactly thrilled by that option, since I didnt want to spend an additional $1.50 to get another twenty, wait another 20 minutes in line, then hope that this bill would feel right. I was a cashier myself for over a year, and I understand the pressure not to let counterfeits past, but there are much more sophisticated and nonsubjective techniques beyond feel, such as checking the watermark or magnetic strip (something she didnt do), using an ultraviolet light (ditto), or using a detector pen (same). I think that I may give Quickly one last attempt to redeem themselves, but at the moment this is strike two from me. Users/JoePomidor

  Ouch.  Just reading this, it almost feels like a strike for me as well...but Ill still give them a try eventually. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20081119 14:39:25 nbsp Anyone know when this place is ever not busy? Users/SunjeetBaadkar

  Tuesday, approx. 3:30 p.m. Thats when I was there yesterday and we were the first in line. Users/condemned2bfree

20081119 17:42:56 nbsp I gave this place a try couple time, and all I get is disappointment. First time, the tea is way to sweet, its impossible for anyone to drink it. Second time, I learned to order it with less sugar, but it tested bland. I even saw one of the guy work there smoke some stuff smell damn like weed. I was hoping quickly will be better than Old tea house, but apparently they are not and even worst.   Users/JackieH.
 The recipe that we learned for the flavored teas or milk teas results in extremely sweet beverages. Most of the workers now know that we need to decrease the syrup by a lot. But if you or anybody ever gets something that is way too sweet, feel free to bring it back to us and we will remake it for you :)Users/jfong252


20081120 01:05:05 nbsp I ordered the baby octopus from there and they were delicious! The only bad thing is they put the piping hot food in a styrofoam box and it melted through.
Also, they are no longer open until 2am on certain days. Users/JessicaYang

20081120 15:30:20 nbsp what do you guys expect out of a chinese owned place? Depending on the owner, theyre either gonna pop out a nice ass place or a cheapascanbe place. And Im not sure about everyone else but this is the latter. However ,it confuses me because Ohanas food is to die for. They just cheaped out on this place, i guess and just trying to make the most money off of a college town. Definetly the quicklys in the bay area, taiwan, other countries that ive gone to are way better in taste. The drinks here are of course super cheap at least for now because of the grandopening specials. But once that ends, i dont think ill come very much. Oh yea, mandarin/canto speakers out there, order in chinese, theyll be a lot nicer to you....sadly but true Users/boked

 Just wanted to say, I dont understand canto, but I speak mandarin. I prefer that customers to speak English to me. But regardless of what language you speak, I treat all of my customers with the same quality of customer service. So Im just saying, just because Quickly is a Chinese place doesnt mean that all the workers fit into the Chinese stereotypes we seemed to have developed.Users/jfong252

20081124 22:22:19 nbsp ive had the honey ginger tea and am sipping on the passionfruit rose tea right now...theyre both REALLY (too) sweet. and they never have durian stuff. personally i consider this a good/great/FANTASTIC thing but my friend doesnt. they are indeed pretty quick, even with the constant line, but ive heard from other people that it doesnt compare to bay area quicklys. the staff has always been nice enough when i go there.  Users/MiranPark

20081126 08:14:36 nbsp Had my first Quickly experience yesterday. The tea was quite excellent actually. I got the green apple green tea (w/ tapioca), since thats my fav at the Old Teahouse. I enjoyed the tea much more from Quickly (as it was less sugary sweet), but the tapioca is smaller and less consistent than the tapioca from Old Teahouse. Because I had read about it here, I took notice of the fly problem. It is a problem. Dude, get an exterminator or something. Thats an infestation. Users/condemned2bfree

20081127 00:02:55 nbsp I gave this place a try TWICE, and didnt like either times. I tried their milk teas and I guess the flavor was really bland, like it was almost watered down.  They need to improve their drinks or the ingredients theyre using.   Users/vietgirlwithappetite

20081203 00:46:46 nbsp Personally. the line is too long. But I love the food there though. The black tea actually taste like tea and the food pretty awesome. But I rather go to a restaurant with a littleless wait. Users/schu

20081204 09:42:16 nbsp Wasnt particularly thrilled with either the food or the tea. I ordered a peach flavored black tea (though I should have asked for it in green) and my beef and broccoli over rice came with a free Jasmine Green Tea as well. The total bill came out to be a little over $9, but thats the price of trying things out, so whatever. I was there for a good hour and a half just chatting with a friend and, while the line got really long, it also seemed to clear out relatively fast as well.

To be straightup honest: I couldnt really tell the difference between the peach black tea and my jasmine green tea with the exception that one was darker than the other. Both had a mildly sweet taste to them, but nothing WHOAverwhelming. I imagine people who prefer to taste the tea in their drinks will appreciate this, but it seems that consistency is still an issue, so who knows.

I wouldnt buy their meals again. Ive yet to try the snacks, but the beef and broccoli was just too salty with little flavor otherwise. My friend ordered the saltandpepper spareribs and that too was definitely a lot more salt than pepper. The meal was also mostly rice, which was actually rather welcome considering I needed something to neutralize the salt.

In the end, I wouldnt rule this place out completely. It appears that many of the employees are reading the reviews on Daviswiki, so hopefully thats a sign that customer input is being taken into consideration. Users/AbbYu

20081206 22:46:39 nbsp Just order a beef with egg over rice and these mother fukers gave me 45 piece of beef and the rest is rice wtf......? Users/shithead

20081210 15:29:33 nbsp Ok. So I really was very excited to see a Quickly come to Davis, but now I am soo over this place. My first experience here was so so. The place was only a few days open and I expected some mishaps. Yesterday I swore off this quickly. The place only had about 6 people in it.... all waiting for their food. About 10 min into my wait for an order of popcorn chicken, I saw the lady bring a bag of food and place it next to the register. I had this feeling it was prob. mine. Around 10 min. later she finally calls my number. I asked her why my food sat there for 10 min with two employees completely ignoring it sitting there. She said, with food in hand pushing towards me, its still hot.... SERIOUSLY!!! That is all I get, a its still hot No Im sorry you were waiting. Talk about some crappy customer service. I am a huge quickly fan, but this experience has totally thrown me off.  Also, can you guys get the flies under control... its just gross. Users/hazeleyes16

20081214 12:51:15 nbsp I love their jasmine milk green tea. I did have to wait FOREVER thought for my sweet potato fries, which really were not that great. However, I tried the eggplant tofu special, and it was great! I enjoyed the free drink that came with it too. They do need to step up on the cleanliness though. The little table by the counter with the couch is always gross and the floor underneath it is disgusting. Users/nicknamebubble

20090104 00:35:26 nbsp This place is pretty good if they could change the whole menu, make the food slightly more edible, and clean the place. Other than that, excellent place! Users/ronlad33

20090118 01:59:07 nbsp Horrible place. The dumplings tasted bad, our drink orders were completely FORGOTTEN and after we reminded them they made our drinks but they were NOT WHAT WE ORDERED! and on our way out there were drunk people smoking and loitering talking shit to us... i will never go back. old teahouse is 1000 times better and thats saying something... Users/ChelsAlex

20090127 14:37:07 nbsp Its the end of January, and Im happy to report that the Grand Opening prices are still on ($.99 drinks). After reading everyones reviews, I took my lowest expectations with me for some jasmine milk tea and popcorn chicken today. It was 1:30 PM, a nonbusy hour. After placing my order (jasmine milk tea w/ small pearls and lychee jelly + popcorn chicken), I sat down at the counter and looked around. The fly problem seems to be mostly dealt with  I counted 10 tiny flies on the ceiling, accumulated mostly over the drinkmixing area. For a fast food place that size, 10 flies couldnt constitute as flyinfested, plus the rest of the place seemed quite clean. There werent spots and stains near the sauce area, no trash lying about the floor/ around the garbage cans, and a glance at the drinkmixing area boosted my liking for the place. It was organized and clean. Plus they were playing Jacky Cheung music videos and I love that guy :)

My milk tea came very quickly, consistent with the speed of various Quicklys in my home town (Cupertino), and it had been made correctly. However the chicken took 10 whole minutes, which is inexcusable considering that it takes 46 minutes to fry the battered meat. I used to work at a Quickly near a high school before my family took over and made it into our own familystyle cafe, and in both places, our chicken never took more than 6 minutes from order to serve. Id also like to note that the cashier served popcorn chicken to someone who ordered after me  I looked several times at that customer and his friend eating it, and Im sure it was chicken. Kind of disappointing since the cashier was quite nice to me... dont know what happened there. After his bag of chicken came out, I had to wait another 5 minutes. Guess they forgot my order?

As for food quality, I really have to praise this new Davis Quickly! The milk tea was fragrant and tasted right, the small pearls were chewy (its hard to make good pearls), there wasnt too much ice to cheat me out of getting less tea. And the portion of the popcorn chicken is HUGE. The bag was bulging when it was handed to me, and still hot. Each piece is about 25% batter and 75% chicken. I sincerely hope this quality will be maintained.

I can attest to the comments above about how rush hours are chaotic. In both Quickly and my familys business (BZ Cafe), everything from the individual customers to a lack of trained employees are factors to the long wait, and it really cant be helped. Of course, positive employee attitudes and high efficiency would improve those situations. As far as work ethic goes... each owner is different so each Quickly should be different, but shady somehow seems to crop up every Quickly I go to or read reviews about. My old one was no exception  the manager would tell me to use less pearls on each drink if we didnt have enough, instead of apologizing to the customer and asking them to wait or go without pearls for the day. She also cut the size of our popcorn chicken by a couple ounces. But it wasnt like she was evil  she simply caved in to the pressure of not being able to serve everyone what they wanted, and sometimes customers can be very demanding.

Overall, compared to other Quicklys, this one gets an 8/10.   Users/EvaL

20090304 10:43:00 nbsp Hmmm.... lets try this again.  So I went here while visting Guad again, cause I needed my tapioca fix for the day.  I get to the reg.... no one else in line and was pretty much ignored for about 5 mins or so (girl was on her cell).  When she finally got off with her BFF, I ordered 3 of the .99 tea special.  I asked if I could add tapioca to 2 of them, and she said sure... thatd be .50 extra per drink... OK, $1.50 plus tax for a drink... not bad.  I pull out my wallet and she says its almost $10... what happend, I thought I ordered the specials.  She said since I wanted tapioca added she had to charge me the regular price.  What a bunch of crap.  Thats the last straw.  I frequent Old Tea House on a regular basis (daily).  I fillout a punch card weekly, so this place lost some major long term tapioca $$$ from me.  Its not that good anyway. Users/Aaron.Curtin

Ive never heard of that!  Charged for a regular price because you wanted pearls in the special drinks?  Is that the new deal now?  UGH!!  Users/strawberry

20090317 21:16:28 nbsp I went in on Monday, March 16, 2009. I ordered a bubble milk tea with Tapioca and I got it within 5 minutes. There wasnt a line either. The girl at the register seemed very tired, it looked like she had a long day. I tipped anyways.

Overall, it wasnt too bad, I didnt really notice any flies though. The floor was kind of dirty, but thats to be expected when a place serves a lot of sweet drinks (people spill the drink, its sugarladen and so the ground gets sticky and attracts dirt).

Ill be coming back some time in the future, and I will post a review then if I do. Users/IdealParadigm

20090318 16:23:29 nbsp This place is getting more and more crappy.  Since the opening of Quickly, my friends and I have been there numerous times.  I can not say that I hate it, but I can not say they are doing a good job either.  Some concerns I have are as follow:

1) ONLY CASH is accepted, this is very inconvenient to some as nowadays, students carry credit cards instead of cash.
2) Adding tapioca to the drink seems to cost more than Old Tea House, and not to mention that Qucikly dont offer a punch  card.
3) Portion of food is not worth the price.  Has anyone notice the downsize of certain entree?  The Bento is definitely not worth the price, rice makes up more than half of the overall portion.  The Curry Fish Balls is a rip off.
4) I really like BBQ Pork and the Roast Duck.  So I ordered it and give it a try, BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!! 5 pieces of BBQ Pork (Roast Duck), 3 Broccoli, and a TRAY FULL of rice is not worth $7$9.
5) Hot and Sour Soup is more sour than hot, quality is just as bad as Panda Express.
6) Congee or porridge as some call it has been downsized.
7) Drink specials cost less at other Quickly.

My advice:

1) get BETTER management skills
2) dont just care about making a profit, because you still have Old Tea House as a competitor.
3) customers are leaving because price is not right, and you are downsizing portions with lead to more customers leaving.
4) dont get sloppy with food. (I ordered a House Special Pan Fried Noddle on a certain Saturday.  It was good, not too saucy and not to dry! Ordered it again days later, it was soggy like a bowl of soup noddles.)
5) Think in a students perceptive, since your primary customers are mostly college students, think on their behalf. good price and good portion.
6) have a manager outside to keep things under control in case things get out of hand.

 Users/Zeek

20090330 03:32:56 nbsp Their drinks are fast and good for the price. The service has been friendly every time Ive been there, even when its busy. I ordered the popcorn chicken and thought the portion was good for the price, but it seemed a bit too salty. I also tried the frozen yogurt and it was terrible, stay away from it! Come for the drinks, not for the food! Users/DannyT

20090410 21:49:15 nbsp Quickly cannot be compared to OTH. OTH serves mainly TAIWANESE food, and Quickly serves mainly canto/HK food!! I like BOTH places, as both have their differences. I dont think any one of them could replace the other, ever. To the person who mentioned price differences in this Quickly vs. the other ones youve been to  Location, rent, sales tax, employee wages, and much more all affect how the owner prices his or her services and products. Theres gonna be a price difference between a Quickly in S.F. and another in, say, Daly City. Same with Davis vs. Sac. With all due respect its Econ 101. You like the S.F. quicklys so much? why dont you drive 2 hours to s.f. and get your tapioca there?? Wait whats that? too far? Youll be spending a fortune in gas? Dont have a car? Cant find a ride? Stuck in traffic? not worth the trip? thats what I thought. we have the only Quickly in the region  learn to love it people. Embrace that shit and help them make it better.

Theres not a SINGLE AUTHENTIC asian restaurant in Davis, EXCEPT OTH and now  Quickly. So for those whore whining  what a way to drive one of the only authentic asian restaurants of this generation out of a college town thats already LACKING in said restaurants. Rather than bashing here on the wiki, many would agree itd be more constructive if you offered helpful suggestions as to how they could improve, like many other reviewers have done. For those of you who complain (and rightly so) about customer service, almost always the customer will have something to do with it. Youll know this when youve worked extensively in the retail industry.

Therere many flaws to this Quickly in Davis, but so do all the other restaurants in town (most of which are decades older than Quickly). So give them some credit!! shiiiet. Im only an occasional customer there, but would certainly hate to see it go away. Its one of the last remaining authentic places like I said, its a shame to see it get bashed so much. Yes, Im a Bay Area native, and yes, Ive lived in HK for years so when I say somethings authentic HKwise, you can be damn sure it is. xD  Users/AnthonyLam

20090418 00:28:15 nbsp Although I frequently come here because Im addicted to bubble milk tea, the service is terrible.  They dont live up to their name, and I swear the people behind the register have hearing problems. After the first time they got my order wrong, I made the point to speak loud and slow, just so it wouldnt happen again. I always order the same thing, large bubble milk tea with small tapioca and litchi coconut, and time and time again, they give me large tapioca (even on the receipt it says small tapioca), and when I tell them they got the order wrong, they say Oh do you want me to fix it? Why is that even a question? I mean, you got my order wrong, I paid almost 5 dollars for my drink, I would like to get what I paid for. Also, a lot of their food is way over priced its ridiculous. $3.50 for 7 fishballs? are you kidding me?

The other Quickly I go to in Dublin also has some pretty terrible service, maybe they just suck at hiring people that are capable of listening and being nice to customers.  Users/masterofmasters

20090512 00:41:59 nbsp This place has a hit and miss on good customer service. I went on Monday at 11:50 pm and received the worst customer service ever. The girl at the register was extremely rude and obviously did not want to be there. Granted it was 10 minutes until closing, but at least she should show some courtesy to the customers. She messed up my order and seemed annoyed when I corrected her. She didnt even bother handing my change, but instead slammed my change on the next table with my receipt without telling me it was mine and moved on to the next customer. It was extremely rude since it is common courtesy to hand the receipt and change to the customer or at least she should have told me it was mine. There were people behind me deciding what to order. She was very impatient about it and tapped her fingers in an annoyed manner and asked if they were ready (in a tone as if to make them hurry).

I ordered their taro pearl tea and it was very powdery. I had to dilute it with water when I got home.

I believe their frozen yogurt is cheapest in Davis. Their selection is limited though and is often out of order.I do like their popcorn chicken. IMO, it is better than old tea houses Users/ilovecandy

20090608 00:40:59 nbsp Quickly SERIOUSLY needs to work on bettering their customer service skills and MANNERS. I placed my order as politely as possible, with my please and thank yous.

20090615 22:04:20 nbsp Ive been a regular customer at quickly since their grand opening. Ive NEVER had ANY trouble with their customer service.

20100122 18:17:28 nbsp Quicklys been hit or miss for me, 2/3 times I went it took a long time to get my drink, however the most recent time I went (few weeks ago) my drink was ready super fast. the first time I went I ordered a Lychee Slush, but it was a bit sugary. . .that may have been before they adjusted their drink recipes, however. The last two times I got Lychee Snow, which was much better. Ive never had an issue with the tapioca either, always a good amount, right amount of squishiness. . .
I havent ordered any food yet but I know most all boba places Ive been too in Orange County always take forever to make the food, so thats not surprising to me. Users/KellyCorcoran

20100125 00:33:22 nbsp I personally prefer the taste of the drinks here over OTH.  Theres just something off about the drinks at OTH.  I havent seen any flies, theres plenty of tapioca in my drinks, and everything comes at about the same pace as Old Tea House when it comes to food, though drinks are a little bit slower (though sometimes theyre faster, depends on whos making them it seems).  I havent met a rude employee either or seen any ticket bumping, so if you can, get your butts over here instead of OTH.  Most of the problems seem to be alleviated.  Something could be done to help the atmosphere though. Users/BmetalV

20100210 23:44:03 nbsp Why would this place not have regular Tapioca available when the store opens? Youd think that a restaurant which has been operating for some time now would understand exactly how long it takes for tapioca pearls to be available to the public and time their operations accordingly, but to my dismay they did not. O well. Too many disappointments and bad experience tells me I have to avoid this establishment from now on. Thats too bad because in the beginning of their opening I was a happy returning customer but now they fail in the simplest expectation.

BTW they only offer 2 drink specials for 99cents now: Black tea or green tea. Thats it.  Users/KimN.

20100301 21:49:32 nbsp Save your time, money, & appetite for Old Tea House instead.

Never coming back here for food (especially!) or even drinks.  I gave the cashier my order and paid and when the person behind me ordered the same exact thing, the cashier told him that it was unavailable.  I popped back and asked her if that meant my order was unavailable, too.  She asked someone behind her and said yes.  Okay, very smart.  I replaced my order with a curry chicken dish.  I realized halfway that there was a CURLY black hair in my curry.  Thats right.  CURLY BLACK HAIR. My friend sitting next to me ALSO found a CURLY BLACK HAIR in her food.

Whats worse is their customer service. I ordered 2 food items to go once and when I finally got my order
the girl pointed to 2 boxes on the counter so I went to get them. I asked her for a bag and she grabbed one
behind the counter and threw it on top of the boxes. I thought she was going to bag them for me,
but she just stared back at me. I ended up doing it myself and the boxes were really greasy on the outside.

                      Well they are a private business with (as far as I know) no prior pronouncements of being familyfriendly.

20100721 03:26:35 nbsp Just ate here earlier today, their portions have gotten a lot smaller compared to when they first released their more restaurantlike menu. More rice less side dishes now.

20100819 17:16:15 nbsp I love this place! Ive always received a great service and regardless of the day, time or how busy the place is, the staff is always mellow and helpful: I usually take my tea without sugar (I dont like sweet drinks that much); the person who took my command suggested I always ask for less sugar. It works perfectly. For some dishes you can also ask for less oil. They are that gracious and the food is yummy! (Try the Singapore Style Fried Noodle)

20101205 00:44:36 nbsp Drinks and food are decent, but service is very lacking. I came in once a little before closing, and was refused service because they were closed. I checked the time, and I clearly had a few minutes before they were supposed to be closed. I doubt that the two longhaired girls behind the counter were managers of any sort, because if a manager was present, I doubt I would have been turned away. If you say you will be open until a certain time, honor it. Just because people want to go home a few minutes early doesnt mean that you should refuse service to someone who comes in thinking that the joint will still be open. After being turned away, I went over to Savemart, which has the same closing time as Quickly, and was able to purchase some snacks because they were still open.  Users/anonymon

20110403 14:19:20 nbsp I just came back from this place and let me tell you this place is horrible. When I spoke with the cashier, she did not greet me, no hellos no thank yous, in fact I was the one who said hello to her. Took about 15 mins to get my strawberry snow! They only had one person working the cashier and the drinks and it was not busy at all. It seems like every single time I come here for a strawberry snow, its always liquidy and it seems like Im just drinking cold juice. I wouldnt recommend going to this place if youre looking for a decent bulba drink.  Users/lx

20110509 19:09:48 nbsp I went today to check it out, its actually pretty good. Not too crowded, fairly cheap, good stuff.
If you want something really good, I would recommend you Old Teahouse, but Quickly is also good.
They make the food fast and you dont really have to wait too long.

20110621 23:59:30 nbsp Nobody in their right mind would go to this place to order a meal. The only thing someone would order here is a drink (which is pretty good). Their meals are horrifying.

Plus they only accept cash here Users/JohnathonJosephs
  Theres no such thing as pork fried rice there.... Users/DavisQuickly

20110812 22:25:22 nbsp A few things about Quickly:
Their drinks are outstanding.  Davis is so lucky to have such a fun place to visit.
In defense of the people complaining about the flies, theres actually not much a business can do when its fly season.  Any time you open a door, there are bound to be critters that make their way in...the one thing they COULD do (not sure if they have or not) is get some even small, cheap fans and place them on their counters.  I worked at Starbucks and we had the same problem, and this is how we dealt with it.
It would definitely be refreshing to see a nonAsian face working at Quickly!!  Not that theres anything wrong with the folks they have...just that being a WHITE FEMALE who does SPEAK MANDARIN, my HOPE would be that they would consider me, assuming I ever did apply! It may be a concept to some people, but YES, white people, and other people of varied races ARE studying and WANT to learn Asian languages!  Users/katietakara

20120903 12:00:29 nbsp I agree with Carlos that this place was much better before. I used to love their cheap meals that included sides and were reminiscent of Japanese bento boxes. But now their food is boring and the service is awkward and inconsistent. I only come in here occasionally for an iced green tea. I recommend the nearby Dosirak or Ding How as passable alternatives in the same complex. Users/ScottMeehleib

20121021 15:24:21 nbsp The food is inconsistent, but its pretty big portions for the prices. I got a rice dish once and was disappointed; I would recommend black pepper udon with fried beef or the beef chow fun. Baked noodles are fine too, just know what you are getting into!

The milk tea here is better than OTHs, but OTH does flavors better, so... Take your pick!

Overall, decent place, I like studying here cause of the free wifi and accessible food. Also, they dont care if you are there for hours. Users/HannahToru

20121222 01:13:30 nbsp Theres one particular female worker here who just stares at you until you tell her what you order, but one time, I had the pleasure of having a different worker working the cashiershe and her friend were very nice, actually said hi and what can I get you? (on a night when it was packed), unlike the formerly mentioned female worker. Quickly recently put up a now hiring sign, so hopefully they hired someone with customer service skills just as great as the latter two girls. Their snow ice is misleading thoughI had the pleasure of eating REAL snow ice back home in Southern California, so I was disappointed when I found out their Snow Ice is really just a drink. Then again, I shouldve expected that much since it was from the drinks menu.  Users/JenniferNguyen

20130106 19:37:19 nbsp Ive been going to quickly fairly regularly since they opened, but tonight will be the last time I go. I ordered a dish Ive had many times before, and picked it up when they called my number (it was the only order on the counter), then drove home. When I opened it at home, I found a completely different dish. I returned with it, and they promptly apologized, saying that another customer had taken my order. They made another dish, and as I walked out I confirmed that it was the one I had ordered. As I drove home, I noticed an unpleasant smell started filling my car. When I or home, I opened it again and the main smell I got was that of old fish, or possibly garbage. A friend who was there described the smell as fishy, and similar to old, used dishwater. I threw away the food without even tasting it, and am eating canned soup as a replacement. Im also going to tell my friends about my experience, so they dont make the mistake I did, of assuming their food would be worth paying any amount for. Users/JoePomidor

20130702 nbsp  Ive begun to notice how inconsistent their menus are. They have three menus, one that is plastered on the window out in front, one on the wall, and one in pamphlet form. Some of the food listed on the menu on the window arent even listed in the pamphlet menu, so its very confusing. Ive tried ordering food Ive seen on the window menu only to be told that they dont have it. Well, then why is listed on one of your menus? Their menu needs a huge overhaul.   Users/MichelleNguyen

20140703 15:27:41 nbsp Came here with a mighty boba need around 8pm on a Wednesday. Nobody else was waiting for service at the register, and there seemed to be one lady handling all the behindthecounter work and another in the kitchen. The lady at the register was quiet and seemed kind of shy, but she ran down the list of options for me for ordering a large milk tea with boba ($3.50). She patiently waited for me to count out exact change.

Drink arrived in about a minute. The tea was watery and kind of flavourless beyond the initial sweetness, and the cup was maybe a thirdfull with boba, to speak generously. Generally, it was unremarkable. Ive had much better bubble tea before for the price, but Im willing to come back and try other flavours. In my regard, Teabo in South Davis has wares that better represent the delicious potential of bubble tea, but Quickly is closer to where I live.  Users/JaniceW
