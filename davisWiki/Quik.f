Quik is a pets kept cats feline who lives with his Users/TiffanySnell mom, Users/SharonZimmerman Sharon and Users/AmyZimmerman Amy, the infamous Zimmerman twins, Users/ScottBiggart Scott of the legendary DavisCoeds DavisCoeds.com and Fish at the Sycamore Lane Apartments.  Originally from LA, he moved to Davis with his previous Dad.   At some point, probably in 2003, he developed an extremely painful abcess in 2 teeth and spent his time in a depressed haze.  Frustrated by the lack of veterinary care he was receiving, he decide to search for a new mommy.  Eventually, he chose Users/TiffanySnell for her School of Veterinary Medicine veterinary aspirations.  She is a proud member of the Class of 2010.  After a tooth extraction surgery in March 2005 at Midtown Animal Clinic, a unique and princely personality was revealed.  Quik soon became a different kitty.  He generally spends his days chasing after bugs, eating, and sleeping.

Quik used to live on A St with Users/JonBafus Jon, the drummer extrodinare for Sholi, who coined the nickname Puff Pants.

Unfortunately, on September 6, 2008, Quik lost his life after being hit by a car :(
