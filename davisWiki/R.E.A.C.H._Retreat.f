The Reaffirming Ethnic Awareness and Community Harmony (REACH) retreat is put on the UC Davis Cross Cultural Center(CCC) and began in 2000. REACH was created by the director and staff of the CCC as they saw a need for dialogue and change after several hate crimes occurred on campus and in the community in 1998 and 1999. At the retreats roughly 100 students, staff, and faculty discuss and explore personal and global stories through large and small group activities. The retreat is coordinated by CCC staff as well as student facilitators who have previously participated in the retreat. REACH is held the first weekend after classes begin in Winter quarter. REACH is mostly attended by undergraduates but UC Davis faculty and graduate students are welcome. The cost to attending REACH is $35 for students and $80 for faculty although fee waivers are available. You can download an application and find more information from the http://ccc.ucdavis.edu/programs/reach.html CCC website. The retreat is limited to 100 attendees and there are often more than 100 applications. Priority is given to students who have never attended REACH. REACH is held in a different offcampus location every year. Past locations have included Asilomar and Lake Tahoe.

REACH is funded by monies allocated to the CCC, fees charged to attendees, and a ASUCD Grants grant from ASUCD.

Every year REACH has a overall theme. Past themes are:
  2007 Redefining Borders: Realizing S.E.L.F. (Social Equality & Liberation from Fear)
