In midFebruary of 2005, the staff assistants of the R4 R4 Recycling Program were informed that summer employment commitments past June 30th will not be guaranteed until a final decision is made by Stan Nosek Vice Chancellor Nosek regarding the future structure of the R4 Recycling Program. After hearing this statement, the R4 Staff Assistants coordinated an effort to try to find out the facts about the future of the R4 Recycling Program.

The Press Release below contains the initial information that the R4 Staff Assistants have gathered from various University personnel. Currently, a draft proposal detailing the changes that are proposed for the program is being circulated amongst University personnel who may be affected by any dramatic changes to the campus recycling program. However, the R4 Staff Assistants have not received a copy of this proposal.

We are continuing to seek information regarding the proposal, and changes that may result.  Updates on this situation will be posted to this site as more information is gathered.
