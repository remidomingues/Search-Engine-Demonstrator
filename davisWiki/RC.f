20090405 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy Mr. or Ms. C, and Welcome to the Wiki!   You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you (or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here).  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for adding the link to the Pasta Q Pasta? entry... I moved it up into the actual entry itself.  You should always feel free to edit any entry directly to add useful information like that directly to the body of the entry. Just click the Edit icon and start adding!  Theres no special class of editors, with everybody else having to leave comments... the entire wiki was written by people like you.  Be brave, and add directly, and it makes the wiki a better, more complete resource for everybody who comes after... youre an equal editor to anybody else here. Once again, welcome to the Wiki!
