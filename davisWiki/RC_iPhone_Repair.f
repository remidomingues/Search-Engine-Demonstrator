20120925 12:30:50 nbsp Does exactly what it says on the tin.  Went to the Apple Store on Sunday and was told it would take $149 to fix my lock button. Mulled it over. Walked into RC yesterday, with no appointment, and they said they could do it for $50 in 25 minutes. 25 minutes from that moment? Indeed. I was skeptical. Got some lunch, came back, and lo and behold, it was ready! $48 including tax. Absolutely brilliant. All my business is belong to them. Users/dizzyditz

20130829 18:30:28 nbsp Amazing! They fixed my ipod by replacing an internal cable and they didnt charge me anything. Users/JohnTerning

20140401 07:34:59 nbsp Theyre fast, friendly, and cheap.  We had to replace a broken iPad screen, and they took care of it within a few hours for far less than the Apple store. Users/Sabihah

20140718 01:29:00 nbsp These guys are absolutely horrible right now. I came to repair my Ipad mini cracked screen and it costed around $200! Lady told me no problem, itll be done in 3 days tops! THREE weeks later and 45 Faulty Screens later, they finally got it to work. Fastforward a few months I start getting weird sensitivity issues. I go to a different store and low and behold... The screen used to repair my old one was a CHEAP and LOW QUALITY faulty screen that finally broke down. I was out of warranty and they vehemently REFUSED to finish their initial service properly, asking me to pay ANOTHER $120, their socalled discount. Laughable, why wouldnt I just buy a new ipad with the money your asking to get one repair correct?

Take a hint everyone, if you need your idevice repaired go to the other store a a block away. I think it was called iFix electronics. Least they keep their promises and actually have competent people working there.  Users/Andyy
