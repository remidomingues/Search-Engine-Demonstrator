20090810 19:59:01 nbsp Welcome to the wiki!  Thank you for the detailed and balanced restaurant reviews.  I found them helpful.  I too am a huge fan of El Mariachis  Ive never tried their tamales or enchiladas, though, and now I know not to bother.  Have you tried the tamales from the Farmers Market vendor?  I find those quite tasty, though I am not a tamale expert.  Also, I am wondering what a California burrito is.  Sometimes that just means a style of burrito  a burrito where the rice and and beans are inside.  But I take it that El M is serving something more than that. Users/CovertProfessor

20090811 05:12:57 nbsp Wow, that was an excellent review of El Mariachi, but I really liked the La Esperanza review.  It was so good, I moved a good chunk of it up into the entry itself, slightly edited (removed the first person).  Feel free to edit any entry directly, and keep in mind this isnt Wikipedia  helpful opinions and well written, balanced reviews are just fine in the entry itself, especially when they give as much information about the subject as that review you just wrote.  Everything on the wiki was written by people just like you, so dont feel confined just to leaving comments. wiki:gnome:Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20090811 21:57:57 nbsp Thanks for the reply about the California burrito.  It sounds like it might be really tasty, though maybe not the healthiest thing in the world! Users/CovertProfessor

20090812 08:21:14 nbsp I kicked the majority of your review into the entry for Zias Delicatessen... again, dont be afraid to edit the entries directly; more information is better than less. Users/JabberWokky
