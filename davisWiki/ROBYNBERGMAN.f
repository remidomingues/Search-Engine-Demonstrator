Robyn Bergman is the coowner and chef of the Mustard Seed.  Shes new to the wiki, and may not have yet read (or know how to access) this page.


20070805 07:54:39 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki I noticed your edits in Recent Changes. I think it might be helpful to read Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner. Constructive editing really pays off around here, but deleting other users contributions tends to cause problems. Users/JasonAller

20070807 17:49:54 nbsp Would you mind explaining why you keep deleting the Mustard Seed page? Users/GeoffJohnson

20070807 17:51:06 nbsp You will probably be banned if you keep up your vandalism.
 Users/WilliamLewis

20070807 17:57:17 nbsp Hi, Robyn,

Id like to add my voice to the chorus of people who object to your recent conduct on this site.  Please do read Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner as Jason suggested.

Thanks,
 Users/Graham.Freeman

20070807 17:58:32 nbsp After witnessing your behavior here (repeatedly attempting to delete a page that reflects somewhat poorly on your business), I can assure you that I will never set foot inside your restaurant. Users/VladLoscutoff

20070807 18:24:30 nbsp i have to say that i had a fairly pleasant experience the last time i visited your restaurant (only on special occasions because its quite pricy and nicely upscale).  However, i will never go again after your repeated attempt to delete unfavorable comments and the entire page itself.  shame on you. Users/MattHh

20070807 19:35:39 nbsp Did anyone think to consider that maybe the user ROBYNBERGMAN is not actually Robyn Bergman?  I know, crazy idea. Users/JeffSpeckles

20070807 20:09:35 nbsp Yes, I wonder if its really her.  After all, theres a big difference between her poor service/attitude at the restaurant and actively deleting comments on the Wiki.  Additionally, it would be odd that shed be deleting pages during dinner service (starts at 5:30pm) at the restaurant. Users/ScottLay
 And yet, she would not be the first business owner to have deleted negative comments.  Its too bad  some business owners get it, and either change their ways or respond to the criticisms if they think they are unfounded.  Seems like that would be a much more sensible response. Users/CovertProfessor
  The signal seems to come from Sacramento, so she cant reasonably make edits in Sac and work in Davis at the same time.  Users/SteveOstrowski
   Steve, it appears that you still doint know how IP addresses work. Users/ArlenAbraham
  Im not sure, this user started a few days ago by removing smaller comments in random places that were antiMS (really random comments that 99.9% of users would never see unless they put some effort into looking for them), then went for allout deletion today.  Id think that someone trying to spoof Robyn would have simply gone for deletion right off the bat, the smaller edits first make this seem a little more genuine.  This person could still just be a random troll, but their actions seem more purposeful than that.  Users/VladLoscutoff
Maybe someone could stroll down there when the user makes another vandalizing binge.  See if shes working.

20070807 22:21:09 nbsp Gee, how many vandalizing business owners have made their user name their actual name in bold caps?  Come on folks, use those brains that got you those big degrees on your walls.  She may be a bitch but shes not completely stupid. Users/JeffSpeckles

20070807 22:30:45 nbsp Holy smokes, Hammerin Hank, here in the flesh.  I know its him because, hey, look at the name.  Tasteless comment though Hank. Users/JeffSpeckles

20070807 22:31:40 nbsp You people are absolutely zero fun. Users/JeffSpeckles

20070807 23:52:12 nbsp thats libel speckles, take it back! Users/StevenDaubert

20070808 00:43:45 nbsp I dont think its productive to say things like Im never going to your business again! even if its really the business owner whos being a moron on the wiki.   That kind of thing is destructive to a community.   People have to be able to make mistakes without being excommunicated, otherwise the overall community becomes hostile and poisoned. Users/Graham.Freeman

20070808 00:46:48 nbsp oh, and yes, Im aware that I recently said I dont have to come (to Delta) 3 times a month while arguing about smoking, and that a reasonable person might see me as being hypocritical.  Im not always perfectly true to my ideals.  :) Users/Graham.Freeman

20070808 10:28:49 nbsp Wow i did not even realize she deleted the mustard seed rating off my user page.  She also deleted a negative comment that was left by an employee of mustard seed off the page as well.  I think that this could not be any accident, because as Users/VladLoscutoff pointed out, the deletions have occured in a very methodical fashion.  I would have never said, i wont go back to the place, if the deletions appeared to look even somewhat like an accident. The only real question is whether it is her, not whether it was on purpose.
