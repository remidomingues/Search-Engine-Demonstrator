20070918 23:24:04 nbsp R & R Thrift is good place to find good deal stuff.  But, there is one lady (cashier) who kinda has a big body and very light skin.  She was not really friendly and was mean to me.  She acted like she thought she was an important person.  Geez.... She is not supposed to do that to customers.   Users/SoMeOnE
