Lagomorphs (scientific family name), including rabbits(Genus Sylvilagus) and hares(Genus Lepus) are part of the Davis Wildlife wildlife that can be seen all around Davis.  The northwest corner of Interstate 80 80 and Mace Boulevard and West Davis are full of them, darting from headlights at Night Time night.

Some of the local 4H Clubs have rabbit programs and members raise them and show them at Spring Fair. Be aware that the guidelines of care for showing rabbits recommended by the ARBA (keeping them intact, diet, cage size, etc.) are not at all in line with (and usually directly contradictory to) what veterinarians recommend for optimal health.

Rabbits can be purchased at Ace Hardware Ace Garden & Pet, but instead of creating demand for breeders and contributing to overpopulation, please consider adopting abandoned bunnies from Yolo County SPCA, Yolo County Animal Shelter, http://www.petfinder.com/petsearch?shelter_idCA1759 Friends of Unwanted Rabbits (Sacramento), or http://www.petfinder.com/petsearch?shelteridCA1320 Sacramento House Rabbit Society. These rabbits come fixed, which saves you hundreds of dollars in surgery costs.

Be aware that companion rabbits live 812 years if cared for properly. If you are not ready for a tenyear commitment, dont get a pet. Bunnies should have several hours of exercise time each day (which is easy for caretakers who adhere to a cagefree philosophy), fresh vegetables, and unlimited hay. Rabbits should never live in a backyard hutch, especially in the California heat, since they can get heatstroke in temperatures exceeding 80 degrees. Spaying/neutering your rabbit is also essential to promoting their health and behavior, even if they arent exposed to rabbits of the opposite sex. Visit the national House Rabbit Society http://rabbit.org/index.html website for more detailed care instructions, tips on littertraining, housing ideas, and information about the downfalls of wood shavings, certain litters, and wirefloor cages.

Rabbits are classified as exotic pets and therefore most veterinarians do not have adequate training to properly diagnose and treat health issues. You can find exotic vets at the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital.

There are also a few Wiki Animals pet bunnies on the wiki.

Local Varieties


Dude, thats a http://www.orcca.on.ca/~elena/useful/bunnies.html hare.   Users/LenaGranik

Jackrabbits are hares (common names often dont reflect proper classification). Both rabbits and hares are subspecies of http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Lagomorpha.html Lagomorpha Users/AmeliaCarlson aec :)
 Subgenera, Lagomorpha is a family name not a genus or species name. Subspecies are variants within 1 species and are noted as a 3rd name Genus species subspecies  Users/AlexMandel

In fact, when I look up the word rabbit one of the definitions I find is hare.   Users/JevanGray Jevan

For the record, all hares are rabbits, but all rabbits are not hares.  Domesticated breeds are not considered to be hares and look completely different.  Wild rabbits however, are generally considered to be hares.   Users/AllisonEriksen
 This sounds like a system more likely to be used in the pet trade, see edits to the above article for clarification on the classification of species.

There is a family of rabbits near the Hickey Gym, and the death star. They live in the bushes.  Users/StevenDaubert

Ive spotted a small, brown rabbit (not a jackrabbit/hare) near the Tercero dorms and one near Kemper Hall a few weeks later. I suppose it could be the same rabbit, since those buildings are not a great distance from one another. Users/AnnaJones

Another pair of small rabbits are by the Bike Barn. Ive seen them on a couple occasions, and they seem pretty habituated to people going back and forth (they didnt bolt for cover as I rode by). Maybe they live around Chem? Inquiring on the doings of some professor? Users/KevinChin

20090124 16:02:58 nbsp yes, Tercero, the Aarboretum, and the bushes near Hickey Gym are where u can find them on campus.  Users/BryceH

20090413 13:32:11 nbsp Does anyone know of any apartment complexes with managers who are OK with littertrained house rabbits?  Perhaps it is just better to sneak him in as a cat...
Thanks! Users/nataliesadler

20110929 20:01:02 nbsp The Bush Rabbit, a subspecies of cottontail rabbit can frequently be found at night near some bushes on the bike trail that runs north from the west edge of the park that includes the two ponds in North Star, through a bicycle underpass to the fields north of Davis.  The bush is on the west side of the bike path just north of the path that goes to the second street south of the fields, Waxwing Place.  The rabbits will frequently freeze as you approach.  I have seen as many as three at this location. Users/RichardBruce
