Race & Ethnicity are often issues of great importance to those outside the majority population. Even in the most tolerant or accepting environment, people may not necessarily wish to be exoticised by the larger community. In communities claiming racial tolerance, covert racism still often occurs, even in our progressively The Dairy bucolic town of Davis. Some prospective students choose not to attend UC Davis for both these reasons.

Compound these issues with the inescapable Campus university presence, bringing with it peoples of different countries, religions, lifestyles and habits, and the conditions for a myriad of misunderstandings are set. Especially within such a small town, it can become difficult for City of Davis local government to adequately address and understand the needs of all its citizenry. Yet this combination of different cultures and ethnicities also leads to many of the things that make Davis special and which are embraced by the entire community, including a wide variety of food foods, DDR, tapioca drinks, International House, and various culture days.

This page is the seed of a forum for addressing issues of race and ethnicity within Davis and a place to document and present historical context. Because of the breadth of this subject, additional information and discussions can be found within the section titled #wiki Related Wiki Pages.


 Definitions 
(Finding a definition that everybody agrees upon is a difficult, if not impossible endeavor. But for the sake of discussion, the following are presented as a basis.)

race
  A race is a population of humans distinguished in some way from other humans. The most widely used racial categories developed based on visible traits (especially skin color and facial features). Some cultures have categories linked to socioeconomic status. Concepts of race, as well as specific groupings, vary according to culture and time, and are often controversial due to their impact on social identity hence identity politics. Viewpoints differ as to whether race is a folk taxonomy or a scientific classification. (wiki:WikiPedia:Race)

ethnic group
  An ethnic group is a group of people who identify with one another, or are so identified by others, on the basis of a boundary that distinguishes them from other groups. This boundary may take any of a number of forms  racial, cultural, linguistic, economic, religious, or political  and may be more or less porous. Because of this boundary, members of an ethnic group are often presumed to be culturally or biologically similar, although this is not in fact necessarily the case.(wiki:WikiPedia:Ethnic_group)

racism
  noun (1936) 1 : a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race 2 : racial prejudice or discrimination Websters Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary

Mixed Race and Multiethnic  multiracial
  Mixed Race is a term used by people who wish to acknowledge their mixed race heritage. The term mixed race is used as opposed to biracial because people may be more than two races. Biracial tends to imply that one parent is one race and the other parent is a different race and can be leading, but both parents could be of the same mixed heritage (such as both parents being White and Black, themselves biracial and thus their children are biracial).

Mixed Race and Multiethnic multiethnic
  A term to acknowledge the mixed culture and history people have grown up with. Anyone who has to identify as (African, Asian, Mexican, Brazilian, Indian, etc)American will have a multiethnic background because they are negotiating a mixed of cultures between their home/native/ancestral culture and the U.S. culture. Multiethnic can also be used by people who grow up as one race but identifies with another races culture (such as a White person who identifies with Hip Hop or Mexican culture).

institutional racism
  Institutional racism (or structural racism) is a form of racism that occurs in institutions such as public bodies and corporations, including universities. Institutional racism is distinguished from the bigotry or racial bias of individuals by the existence of systemic, pervasive and habitual policies and practices that have the effect of disadvantaging certain racial or ethnic groups. Institutional racism is often functionally integrated. Examples may include racism in the criminal justice system e.g. police profiling, racism in education e.g. racially biased materials, segregation by economic class and thereby race, and hiring from geographic regions with few minorities resulting in a wiki:WikiPedia:Glass_ceiling glass ceiling. (wiki:WikiPedia:Institutional_racism)

implicit bias
 http://americansforamericanvalues.org/unconsciousbias/ Implicit bias (also called unconscious bias or hidden bias) can occur in people who hold egalitarian values, but at the same time act upon racial or other biases without even being aware that they have such biases.  Implicit bias can result in differences in hiring and promotion, or even http://www.essence.com/news/hot_topics_4/shopping_while_black.php differences in treatment as a customer in a store.

 Races/Ethnic Groups in Davis 
see Demographics for a breakdown of ethnicities found within Davis as well as UC Davis
 AfricanAmericans or Blacks
 ArabAmericans
 Asians and Asian Americans or AsianPacific Islander American
 EuropeanAmericans or Whites
 Hispanics or Latinos/Latinas
 Indians or East Indians
 Mixed Race and Multiethnic Americans
 Native Americans or American Indians

No classification scheme is perfect, because there is no scientific evidence for anything resembling our cultures concept of race.

In most cases, people use stereotypes based on appearance.  Many of these may not be true for those who have assimilated into mainstream American culture; others may be blatantly false.  Some may actually be true:  white people do sunburn easily.  However, these stereotypes do have an effect on peoples thought processes, whether they want them to or not  putting things in groups is human nature.  It is best to be aware of what stereotypes you believe, and be willing to change them or make exceptions to them at any time.  In short, think for yourself.

Many of these common names have been adopted by different groups, which use these names as a way to unite people and build community behind a common ethnicity.  Example groups include wiki:WikiPedia:NAACP NAACP, APIQ, and various fraternities and sororities.

  Claims of racial profiling by the Davis Police. source: http://occr.ucdavis.edu/news/view.cfm?news_id160 November 16, 2005 Davis Enterprise
 White people make up 70.1 percent of the Davis population, according to 2005 figures, and in 2004 they received 61 percent of the 6,762 traffic citations issued by Davis police, Hyde reported. Hispanic people comprise 9.6 percent of the population and were issued 14 percent of the citations.
 African Americans make up 2.3 percent of the population and were issued 5 percent of the traffic citations. Asian people comprise 17.7 percent of the population and were given 16 percent of the tickets. People whose race was unknown by officers were given 4 percent of the citations.
 But, when comparing traffic citations with total population, the statistics appear to show that 9 percent of Davis white residents were cited in 2004, 15.1 percent of Davis Hispanics were, 9.4 percent of Davis Asian people were and 23.4 percent of local African Americans were.
 Those conclusions, however, do not take into account the possibility of repeat offenders or people who do not live in Davis.
 Among Davis residents, the data appears to show that 4.7 percent of Davis white residents were cited, 5.6 percent of Hispanics, 4.6 percent of Asians and 9 percent of African Americans.

 On October 26, 2003, four young people tagged with graffiti and threw more than 10 dozen eggs at the cars of an openly gay man, Robert Russell, and that of an African American family. Witnesses who reportedly heard the youngsters shouting racist and homophobic slurs led police to the arrest of a 16year old Davis High student who refused to cooperate and was later offered a plea bargain by the District Attorney.

 While arranging rocks at the Yolo Causeway levee, members of a Sac State Asian American sorority are assaulted with threats and racial slurs by a group of white male members of a UC Davis fraternity. Later in the month, 15 white males affiliated with Kappa Sigma fraternity broke into an apartment and assaulted five Korean Americans, calling them chinks and ransacking the apartment. Then in December, a fight broke out at the levee between at least 70 members of Kappa Sigma and three Asian American fraternities  students reported that the frat guys pushed one Asian student, saying, Get off the hill, chink. Campus officials attribute this to drinking rather than racism, and dealt with these attacks as private, individual matters. http://rwor.org Revolutionary Worker #1109, July 1, 2001

 http://www.chander.com/2005/09/and_dont_come_b.html City Resolution Opposing Return of Japanese to Coastal Areas: 1943
 On June 21 1943, Mayor CA Covell proposed and the Davis City Council unanimously and officially protested return of Japs to the coastal areas of the Pacific and sent this resolution to US Senators Hiram Johnson and Sheridan Downey, Representative Leroy Johnson and President Franklin D. Roposevelt. The Davis Enterprise supported this position, stating in the June 25 issue, If Its For the Good of Davis the Enterprise Is For It. The Council commended the internment and urged amendment of national laws to prohibit the return of Japanese. Resolution No. 1 Series 1943 declared:

 WHEREAS
 the City Council of the City of Davis
 believing further that a return of said Japanese Nationals to the State of California, after cessation of hostilities, should be prevented by enactment or amendment of the laws of the United States of America;

 NOW THEREFORE, the City Council of the City of Davis, hereby commend the action of said Military Authorities in evacuating said Japanese Nationals and hereby urge such legislation or amendment of the laws of the United States of America as will prevent the return of said evacuees after cessation of hostilities.

 On December 21, 1940, the annual Faculty Club Goose Stew at the old UC Davis Recreation Hall featured a blackface minstrel show for the evenings entertainment. (John Lofland Lofland, John. Davis: Radical Changes, Deep Constants. 2004. pg. 118.)

 On January 26, 1940, a group of white store owners requested that the city council disallow the opening of a grocery store that was to be owned and operated by Asian Americans. There was a belief that the Asian Americans would work longer hours for less money, thus potentially putting the less competitive and less industrious white American grocers in jeopardy. The council stated that they could not create a law to specifically ban the Asian grocers, but they compromised by establishing an ordinance that restricted the hours a grocery store could be open. The ordinance specifically exempted every other type of business from such restrictions, thereby emphasizing the racism underlying such an action. (John Lofland Lofland, John. Davis: Radical Changes, Deep Constants. 2004. pg. 117.)

Why the revert war, AlphaDog?  Users/JosephBleckman
 Its only a war if you choose to declare one. Your edits appeared to be more about airing thinly veiled personal insecurities of feeling surrounded by Asians. The examples, e.g. Hispanic in an African university, were originally inserted to mollify those in the majority who would cry reverse racism. Based on your edits, that approach has failed. If every individual insists on an example specific to their perceived environment, the page loses focus. Perhaps there is some value in your edits that isnt evident, but that you can clarify. As this seems to be a personal issue, Id welcome continuing this discussion on either your personal page or mine rather than further muddying this page. Users/AlphaDog
  What the hell man? I suggest not trying to misplace your own thinly veiled personal insecurities, as you so imaginatively phrased it, onto other people. I added in that line, because far too often Ive noticed that people assume that people in the alleged majority (usually assumed by them to be EuropeanAmericans) never exist as minority groups in a region. A position you seemed to be reinforcing by your repeated unexplained reverts, hence why I asked for clarification. Secondly, how exactly do you get the impression that my perceived environment is surronded by Asians? I dont know about you, but I go to UC Davis, a place of uberdiversity, not one dominated by any one ethnicity. Users/JosephBleckman
   Ha UCD uberdiversity?? Check your facts http://facts.ucdavis.edu/ first. UCD is white dominated in students, faculty and staff.  Users/JoAnnaRich JR
      Actually, youre part wrong. http://facts.ucdavis.edu/student_headcount_ethnicity.lasso Same site!. For undergraduate students, theres actually 2% less whites then asian people...if that makes a difference. But how is that diversity?  Or how isnt it?  Is diversity only measured by numbers?  Is it only considered diverse if white people arent the majority?  I dont understand the point of this, or the meaning of measurement.   I mean, if its a numbers game, the state of California is 63% white, and 12.3% asian (2000 census). (I believe the entire country is 75 and 3%). So Id venture to say UCD is more diverse than the state, in terms of white vs whatever.  What Im really trying to say is: what would it take for you to consider UCD diverse?  I agree with Joseph below and that I do feel there are many groups and that the campus is diverse.  I dont consider the fact that its white dominant to be that its less diverse.  Its not exactly a huge, staggering domination, and at the undergraduate level, theyre not even the majority for the 05 fall count anyway.
   I consider the mix that the campus has to be uber diverse, since there are so many groups represented in such significant amounts. But, I guess that your point makes me even more perplexed as to what AD was saying. Users/JosephBleckman
