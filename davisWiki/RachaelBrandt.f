Describe Users/RachaelBrandt here.

20110504 00:22:44 nbsp Hi Rachel and Welcome to the Wiki. We all hope you will find this site to be helpful to you, but dont forget you can be helpful to others as well with all the editing and creative rights of all the editors here on the Wiki. Been trying to help you on the Her Campus page and hope you dont take is as an attack or as an type of personal insult if it is altered.  Odds are it will be altered several more times by several more editors as time goes on.

If you would like to meet some of the editors here on the Wiki, we are having a potluck on 572011 at Slide Hill Park. More info can be found here: Wiki BBQ May 7 2011 Users/WesP

20110504 00:26:46 nbsp Hi Wes, Thank you for helping edit my site. At first I didnt realize you were making the changes and I thought it was a glitch, but then I realized you were controlling those edits. Thanks for helping to improve my wiki page, and Ill put my creative rights to work on the site as I see fit. Thanks again Users/RachaelBrandt

20110504 08:38:07 nbsp Ive already chimed in on the Talk page you started, but let me add my welcome.  You might also want to read Welcome to the wiki/Business Owner.  Sometimes the wiki isnt what people expect it to be, so it can take a little while to sort things out.  I hope you stick around to contribute to other areas of the wiki.  Users/CovertProfessor

20110504 14:59:02 nbsp The way the page is currently written makes it sound like theres a partnership between The California Aggie and HerCampus, which there is not. Id suggest finding a different way to phrase that. Users/jsogul
