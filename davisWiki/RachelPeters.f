Silent Auction Item Details Three Star Parties for the three highest bids: A star party is where I will bring my telescope out to a bidders house or a prearranged dark place and give an hour or so long viewing of astronomical objects with my scope, and Ill answer any questions the group has. Each party can have up to 15 people, and I will arrange a date, time, and place with the winner of the item. This is great for all ages!

20071002 08:15:16 nbsp well, I dont get it anymore.  We stopped getting a lot of mail for other people.  Maybe the post office finally decided to pay attention to our request only receive mail addressed to us.  Anyway, I just returned them all to the sender.  I guess if I get more I could just go hand it to you, since you still live here, heh. Users/BradBenedict

20100822 10:14:15 nbsp Hi Rachel, thanks for volunteering to table on Wednesday!  Ive got most of the equipment for it, but I cant make Wednesdays.  Its definitely far easier tabling with a buddy, so hopefully we can find another volunteer for Wed.  If youve got vehicle space, I can probably drop off the table, canopy, chairs, etc. in the next couple of days. Users/TomGarberson
