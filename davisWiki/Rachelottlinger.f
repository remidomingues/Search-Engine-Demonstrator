Where do I start? Im Rachel Ottlinger owner of Davis Therapeutic Massage. I rent space at the Revive Massage center so I have been using my own name lately as my business name so clients wont get confused. I came to Davis from Vacaville and have been here now for about 17 years. I own 3 cats, a ball python and a bearded dragon. Well the reptiles are my 15 year old sons, but I love them just as much. :)  I am a young mom, so if you see me,  youll probably think theres no way I have a 15 year old! My boyfriend and I (of 10 years!) met while we worked at University florists across from the Davis Funeral Chapel.

20081025 10:20:22 nbsp Hi Rachel, I saw you removed the personal comment for you that was left on Davis Therapeutic Massage so I thought Id drop you a note saying hi and create a personal page where people can leave comments for you :)  Users/ElleWeber

20090413 11:37:05 nbsp Hi Rachel, I saw your comment indicating you were having troubles with your image sizing. I fixed the problem  to make images appear smaller, just add in thumbail to the code, like {{{Image(Image.jpg, thumbnail, right)}}}. You can make the thumbnail larger or smaller by adding in numbers, like {{{Image(Image.jpg, thumbnail, 300, right)}}}. Help with Images is good for stuff like this. Good luck! :) Users/ElleWeber

20100813 11:50:18 nbsp Rachel, are you still having trouble with people picking up after their pets in your area? If so please let me know and Ill make sure that we take extra care when cleaning the grounds in your area. I know summer means our maintenance staff is stretched thin this summer, but we want to make sure our current residents dont get neglected! Users/PinecrestManager
