One of the means of encouraging Speed Limits speed limit compliance in town are the new speed signs. These signs have joined the Radar Trailer that is moved from site to site around town. If you are going over the speed limit the sign will flash slow in red.

 Users/StevenDaubert Notes that if you drive too fast near the Arthur St. one 5+ mph over limit it changes to a flashing red/blue light that look freakishly similar to the thin strip LED lights on top of the police cars. You instinctively take you foot off the gas / start braking if you dont know its coming.
