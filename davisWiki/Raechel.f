Davis Wiki is a wiki created about the city of Davis. It is hosted on Wiki Spot, a service that hosts wikis. This is where the noncommercial part comes in. You cant create a wiki for commercial purposes. Davis Wiki isnt a commercial wiki... however it contains information about businesses in town because that is relevant information. If you were to go to Wiki Spot and create a wiki for your business there, then youd be breaking the Wiki Spot community guidelines.

Just keep in mind that your business page on Davis Wiki belongs to the community. Its different from going out and creating a web site for your business. Anyone can edit it... and chances are you wont like some of those edits. However, youre free to respond to anything that people post on your page.

Happy editing! Users/WilliamLewis
