20050210 02:46:12 nbsp you are right about the ghandi thing. BUT I think that the Nobel committee was wrong in 1947 when they considered awarding Ghandi with the prize and chose not to. Also, the banner is meant to be ridiculous so of course it isnt 100% true. Im sure other candidates could be compared to ghandi for various different reasons. Users/RobRoy
