The Lyrics, as sung by the Aggie BandUh:

He always sings
Lazy music to his cattle as he swings
Back and forward in his saddle on a horse
(pretty good horse)

That is syncopated gaited
There is such a funny meter
To the roar of his repeater

How they run
When he shoots his gun
Because the western folks all know

Hes a highfalootin rootin tootin
Son of a gun from California
Hes some cowboy
Talk about youre cowboy
Ragtime Cowboy Joe!
