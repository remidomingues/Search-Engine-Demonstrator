The Mediterranean climate of Davis means you can expect a bit of rain during the winter.  In fact, sometimes you can expect a ton of rain.  Sometimes it takes Freshman Stripe newcomers a while to get used to it.

Davis receives nearly 20 inches of rain annually, which is a quite a bit compared to many cities throughout the state, but not that much from a national perspective.

Local soils can only absorb 1/2 to 1 of rainfall before water starts to run off. Runoff will puddle or run into storm drains. If the drains are blocked with leaves, water will back up onto surface streets. Soil along county roads becomes saturated after just a few inches of rain. Your car will very likely get stuck in the mud if you pull off onto a dirt shoulder.

Not all puddles are the result of rain, some are Perpetual Puddles year round.
