I think the proposal was to build a new mishkas on the pump house site with the Orange trees. The pump house is getting relocated and I know they have business that specialize in tree moving. Users/StevenDaubert
  Thats what I recall. But perhaps something has changed? or maybe there is some new need for public awareness? e.g., perhaps some people feel relocating the trees is problematic and should be debated further, or that there wasnâ€™t sufficient public oversight to begin with? Users/ZacharyNorwood ZN
 Best of luck getting any meaningful policy change on this one (dead serious) your best bet is to transplant the trees and hope some make it. Sinish wants mishkas to expand and be closer to the varsity/icekrimski, and theyve invested enough into the varsity to show the city that they are for real.
