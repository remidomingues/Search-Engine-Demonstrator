Designed and built by local volunteers, Address(Rainbow City, 38.559838, 121.745724)  is one of the play areas in Community Park. Unlike most play areas in Davis, Rainbow City is largely wooden, not prefab metalandplastic. Features include plenty of castles, a pirate ship, an ice cream stand, a giant sand box, swings, slides, climbing tubes/tires and even a working intercom system (It goes from the train near the swings to the small corridor on the 2nd story near the firepole and the slides with the box tube) There is also a slightly raised area with benches for parents, and a table on the left when you walk in. The thing you walk over to get into the park used to move side to side. One used to be able to get directly under the parents table with some crawling and digging. Rainbow Summer for kids is held in the nearby arbor, that is what the small storage shed is for.


This area is a favorite airsoft area of Users/TaylorClark Taylor Pancakes Clark, because at night he can hide in the dark shadows and destroy people when they are unaware. He is a ninja after all.  NOTE:  The number of people he has actually shot in this fashion is around 3 since he started playing there.

Wow, this park looks alot like Andrews Park in Vacaville! Users/MichelleAccurso
And Fort Natomas in Sacramento! Well... before someone burned it down. Users/MoTorres

20051209 01:26:06 nbsp This is the best park in Davis. It holds a candle to some of the best parks Ive ever played at. We once visited Rainbow City in the wee hours of the morning while drunk and found a severed pigs head sitting on a picnic table. We tried to pick it up by its ear but we tore the ear off. Users/GautamJoshi

20051209 10:18:31 nbsp yeah. it looks TONS like Andrews park. i remember i used to crawl under all of the play structures (lots of kids did. it was the best for hide and seek)... but then i started seeing rats under there, and now i dont even walk NEAR that park.  Users/NoraSandstedt

20070528 13:20:20 nbsp nice park but I dont like to take my kids there because of the rat problem. Users/HeatherFlood

20070528 17:42:33 nbsp Ive never seen rats here, am I blind? Users/EdHenn

20070528 21:45:28 nbsp I still bring my kids here once in a while, but keep them away from places where Ive seen or heard them (mice, in my case, not rats): under the platform at the north end of the bigger kids monkey bars, and underneath the area by the wheel of the train. And the smaller crawlspaces in general, but they havent gotten interested in those yet (my kids, not the mice). Users/KevinChin

20100327 00:33:32 nbsp My friends and I practiced here for our Le Morte DArthur movie in Winter 2010.  Users/ArianeMetz

20100327 01:36:20 nbsp I used to try to crawl through as many small spaces here as I could and I dont remember seeing any mice or rats. This was over 10 years ago though, maybe its more dangerous now? Users/NickSchmalenberger
 I would go under the places you werent even supposed to go, and I never saw any evidence of rats and mice  Users/StevenDaubert

20110108 16:06:13 nbsp I love this playground, but I think it could be a little dangerous to little kids.. and anyone else. The swinging platform at the main entrance of the playground is pretty deceiving.
I also managed to ram my forehead into a horizontal wooden post above one of the ladders. Who puts a post in a place where people walk through?? Users/glorial
All the dangerous stuff was removed when I was a kid, and Im pretty sure that horizontal wooden post accommodates the children nicely.Daubert

20120103 10:41:34 nbsp Took the munchkin here yesterday and ended up leaving due to the pervasive odor of urine (admittedly, none of the scores of other children/parents seemed particularly bothered by this).  Its still a pretty awesome play structure, though. Users/BlytheDurbinJohnson
