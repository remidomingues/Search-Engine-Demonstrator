There are many people in Davis that are LGBTQIAP (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, intersex, asexual, allies, polyamorous) or a combination thereof. In fact, if you look in the right places youll find all kinds of nellies and queers, butches and femmes, lesbians, homos, fairies, dykes, fags, bisexuals, pansexuals, nonmonosexuals, transfolk, asexuals, shifters, neutrois, vampires (the sexual kind, and yes, in that case its a sexual subgroup), otherkin (including femmekin and nullkin), furry (sex while dressed as an animal), zoo (sex with animals), power exchange as gender, genderfuck, othergendered and goodness knows who else. Fortunately, there are also many resources available in Davis for all people, regardless of their sexual orientation, preferences, or identity.  The campus community has also been heavily involved in a number of programs and discussions on the intersections of personal identity politics, such as Race & Ethnicity race, class, gender and Sex sexuality.

20070927 11:39:52 nbsp In my opinion, the Delta of Venus is a safe place. I do not think any of the staff there would tollerate any homophobic or hostile behavior and neither would most of the patrons. I cant say the same for the G Street Pub. Users/PxlAted
