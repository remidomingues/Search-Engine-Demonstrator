Rainbow Summer is a summer camp run by the City of Davis Community Services Department. The camp is for elementary school aged children (and those entering 7th grade). Camps are offered at Community Park, Manor Park or Slide Hill Park Slide Hill Park, and Westwood Park. It was briefly offered at Northstar Park Northstar. The camp at Community Park is geared toward the younger kids (1st4th Grades). The camp is the least expensive the City offers. Activities range from swimming, to arts and crafts, to massive games of capture the flag. Each week, campers have a theme which is continued through activities and field trips. Many Davisites have fond memories of antics at Rainbow Summer. Sometimes the camps would challenge each other and have massive games of capture the flag in community park.

Rainbow Summer Voyagers is the older variant, where kids meet up at Community Park and then bike several miles in and around Davis. This isnt to be confused with Camp Putah
