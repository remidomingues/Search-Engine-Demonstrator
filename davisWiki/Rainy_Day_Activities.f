It can rain quite a bit during a Davis winter.  This can make outdoor activities difficult.  Here are some suggestions for some rainy day activities to while away the time.

  Movies
  Museums and Exhibits
  Davis Branch Library  also good for kids, who can browse through books, or hear stories on the computers
  MU Bowling Alley Bowling at the MU Games Area
  Check out some Art Galleries art http://daviswiki.org/Art_Galleries#head5f17d57f23f07cd97a32d75690e4897223ff5df1 around town or on http://daviswiki.org/Art_Galleries#head211b7daf035817f991fbbb06a825dae1df8ecaf5 campus (but bring an Umbrellas umbrella to get from place to place)
  Some people like to Greenbelts walk in the rain
  Help!  What are some fun Davisspecific activities to do indoors, especially with an outoftown guest?
  Give them a Virtual Tour of Davis virtual tour of Davis using the Davis Wiki, or wiki:Gnome the wiki.
  Climb Rocknasium
  If you do not already own one (or many), pick yourself up a board game and host Game Night. These places generally offer a myriad of games:
       Thrift Stores
       Borders , Target , Walmart
       Alphabet Moon , Dragonfire Toy Company
       Bizarro World

 There is also, of course, the old standby of Alcohol boozing.
