20140512 11:46:07 nbsp Reading this through, there is no restriction that the Employee has to be within the City, just the Employer has the Employee work within the City limits? That does concern me that the jobs in Davis will be getting numerous more applicants from West Sacramento, Woodland & Dixon, specifically because of the higher legal wage possible compared to equivalent jobs more local to them. Without any protections, that would have more Davis jobs filled by nonDavisites on average, yes? Sorta the same logic used to have stores like Target, etc in Davis so the money of the citizens is spent locally, except in this case, more would be going to noncitizens of Davis as it becomes very worthwhile to apply in our city than elsewhere. I know there is already some crossover between cities naturally but this makes a Davis job much more tempting and desirable than any local one in one of the other cities. Not to mention the incentive for our chain stores, where someone in a neighboring citys branch of a chain applies to our local branch, and is hired because they are experienced and hence the local branch saves on training, leaving the Davisite to need to commute outofcity for the lowerpaying opportunity. Or am I missing something in the text or other existing City ordinance that employers consider local applicants by preference? Users/JeffWood
