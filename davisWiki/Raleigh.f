Raleigh (also known as Sgt. Pupkins) is a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel who fears the outdoors and dogs larger than himself.  He lives with two such dogs, Sasha and Riley but spends most of his time hiding in CatherineRichardsons room.  The intense love which may be observed upon his features in the picture above is directed at a plate of eggs and toast.
