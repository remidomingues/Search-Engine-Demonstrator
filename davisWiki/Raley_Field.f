wiki:westsac:Raley Field has been home to the Sacramento wiki:westsac:River Cats, the Triple A affiliate of the Oakland As, since 2000. The team has been the last stop before the big leagues for many future baseball stars, like Barry Zito, Nick Swisher, Kurt Suzuki and others. Also, if a big league star is recovering from an injury, they usually have to complete a short stint in the minor leagues, meaning theres a possibility of seeing fairly popular players here every once and awhile.

Looking for a relatively cheap but awesome date only like 1015 minutes from Davis? The lawn seats (a grass slope in right field) for River Cats games are usually in the sub$10 range. Theres always something magical about the ballpark experience.

For baseball games, its capacity is about 15,000 fans, but they rarely sell out (even though they do usually lead the minor leagues in terms of attendance numbers).

Besides baseball, the stadium is the home to numerous festivals, special events and concerts (though larger concerts are typically held at Arco Arena, home of the Sacramento Kings).
