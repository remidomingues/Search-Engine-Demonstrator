Should have gone with Boost Mobile.. better coverage in Davis, and cheaper than any other plan out there.. also available from Radio Shack.  They have daily plans, per call/text plans and the unlimited web/text/data/call monthly plan (which I use personally) for a mere $50.00/month with no contract. It is also the only plan with shrinkage so the longer you stay, the less you pay.. My monthly unlimited plan now cost me only $35.00/mo. with all the bells and whistles.  Users/WesP Wes
