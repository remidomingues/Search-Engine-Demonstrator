This Supermarkets supermarket occupied 24,995 sq. ft. in Davis Manor. The Davis location opened in 1999 and closed in April 2002. All Northern California Ralphs stores eventually closed down. Ralphs is now only found in Southern California. Dollar Tree now occupies half of the building. The Ralphs in Vacaville also closed down.

Prior to being a Ralphs it was an Albertsons. After Albertsons sold this store to Ralphs in 1999, Albertsons renamed the Lucky store in Davis and turned it into an Albertsons. Albertsons had bought the parent company of Lucky in 1998 and then decided in late 1999 to eliminate the Lucky name and rename all Lucky stores as Albertsons.


They should have Trader Joes in this building along with the Dollar Tree that is currently in onehalf of the building.  The parking is fabulous and it would sure make this shopping center come alive. The shopping center also has a great thrift shop (R&R) and the Symposium Restaurant which is totally awesome.
I dont understand why they would want to try and cram Trader Joes into the UMall.  What a disgusting mall that place is with all the bird poop and lack of parking.  I dont even like going to UMall, in fact I avoid it as much as possible.  There isnt enough parking at UMall now, so can you imagine what it would be like if a Trader Joes did go into UMall?  Is there anything we can do to try and get Trader Joes into the Davis Manor Mall?
