Howdy, Ralphy, and welcome to the wiki!  I noticed your comment on Pasta Q, and figured you might not know that everything on the wiki is made by people like you  so if you notice somethings wrong or needs to be updated, you can change it yourself.  Every page on the wiki was created by and for the people of Davis, each of us just adding what we know.  So feel free to click the Edit icon on any entry, the wiki belongs to you... and everybody else in Davis.   Its kind of like a community park; everybody shares it and keeps it clean and fun.  Once again, welcome to the wiki! Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
