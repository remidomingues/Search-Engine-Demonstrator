Instant ramen soup is often jokingly referred to as a staple of the college students students diet. While most cheaply packaged variants are not nutritional unless other ingredients like vegetables are added, ramen is extremely Living Cheaply cheap and comes in a variety of brands and flavors. It requires a very short preparation time, and depending on the brand, the soup can either be microwaved in its package cup or removed from its wrapping and cooked on a stove. Maruchan and Nissin (Cup of Noodles and Top Ramen) are the most common brand choices, mainly because of their availability in stores such as SaveMart, Safeway, and even Rite Aid. Kims Mart sells alternative and premium varieties of ramen, including kimchi flavor.

20090809 04:55:18 nbsp Im in Japan for the summer, and have been eating real ramen for the past couple of months. I have not been disappointed once. Davis needs a dedicated Ramen shop. I want to make it happen. Users/smccord

  There used to be an awesome place called The Ramen House (replaced by Thai Nakorn), but it was student run and had a small staff.  There were points I would drop by during their open hours and they would be closing early because the person who usually makes the food didnt show up.  But those times that person did, wow...best ramen Ive had around.  And their kimchi udon was like no other. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

  Yes, I remember the Ramen House. It was okay, and dedicated to ramen, but ... its a serious dish, when done right, and served right, is just out of this world. Would Davis support a small shop, with about ten to fifteen stools, serving ramen that would end up being the last meal for the day?   Users/smccord
