20140401 18:40:52 nbsp Finally, a ramen place in Davis! I ordered the tofu ramen with wakame salad, and while they were good, they didnt really meet my overall expectations. I guess Im just picky when it comes to ramen. Service was friendly and prompt.  Users/MichelleNguyen

20140401 23:32:51 nbsp Even though its not indicated on the menu, several of the ramen are vegetarian, if this is important to you.  AFAIK, any lightly salted broths are vegetarian.  Do ask, though, to be sure.  Ill edit this comment after the next time I go back to add more information. Users/Patrick.M

20140528 22:23:50 nbsp Portions are large and ingredients are fresh.  The ramen soups are really yummy.  Service is friendly.  Well worth the trip. Users/CovertProfessor

20140528 23:30:31 nbsp Large portions, okay ramen, doesnt really compare to the ramen places in Sac. However for the location and portions its not too bad. I am however disappointed in their boiled egg, the ramen places in Sac has Medium/Soft Boiled Eggs whereas Ramen Hook is just a plain Hard Boiled Egg.  Users/ClarenceL

20140617 12:59:02 nbsp Ive been spoiled by Bay Area ramen, so I came into this place with pretty unreasonable expectations. Its alright. The portions and value are an easy sell, and the service is friendly, but out of all of the broths, the only one that stuck out to me was their tonkotsu broth, and that one is really oily. Dont expect any of their spicy broth to be that spicy. My only source of ramen before coming here was Zen Toro, so I hope to see this place improve in the future.  Users/RomanRivilis

20140730 11:15:06 nbsp Decent.  It satisfies my ramen fix, but its not the best Ive ever had.  And its cheaper than Mikunis ramen bowls.  You can request less fatty pork which is a plus (otherwise they WILL give you pork that consists of mostly fat).  Friendly staff, clean place, fast service. Users/j0liefllle

20140808 17:33:51 nbsp If you guys remember hibachi where burgers and brew is now, and you miss the teriyaki chicken rice bowls, this place had the exact rice bowl!! I was so excited when I tasted my first bite because I have been searching for years for something remotely similar to that.
Their California rolls are also amazing. I havent tried the ramen, but I will eventually. Users/davispunk
