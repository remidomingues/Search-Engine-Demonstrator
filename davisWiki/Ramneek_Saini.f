Official Statement
I am a third year, political science major and I am an ASUCD senate intern, CALPIRG statewide Hunger and Homelessness coordinator and two time speech and debate state champion. I have successfully organized a statewide Hunger CleanUp, which raised over $80,000 for the victims of New Orleans and this quarter I helped CALPIRG register over 1200 UC Davis students to vote. Davis is an amazing campus and as a senator, I want to make it better by:

  Advocating for social change on campus by registering more students to Elections vote!
  Establishing an ASUCD events email that will allow groups to promote their events and organizations
  Fighting for more resources on campus for homeless students

As a senator I will make sure that everyone on this campus has a chance to vote by getting people involved in voter registration drives. Right now students between the ages of 1829 are not voting enough! As 25% of the voting electorate, if we turn out to vote, we can easily get our presidential candidates and elected officials to do something about issues that affect us, like affordable education and cheaper textbooks.

When elected I’ll also establish an ASUCD events email for which any student can sign up. Davis is a vibrant campus with tons of different events going on every night. This monthly email will not only provide each one us with an up to date schedule of what’s going on, but will also give student groups an easy way to increase visibility.

I will also continue working on my greatest passion – advocating for the hungry and the homeless. On our own campus right now there are students who are homeless, fighting every day to pay for necessities we take for granted. Yolo County has one of the highest poverty rates in the state. If students come together, it’s definitely possible to find a solution to these problems…
BUT I NEED YOUR HELP! Vote me number 1, and the other L.E.A.D. candidates 26 and we’ll bring you SOCIAL CHANGE like you’ve never seen before!
