Ranchers Saloon was one of the establishments that served shots of alcoholinduced happiness to the early Davisville community. Existing in the late 1800s, the saloon was owned and operated by John Caulfield, who had, true to the name, previously worked on a ranch. Near the turn of the century, the Davis Enterprise took over the location, where it proceeded to print its daily editions for many years. Although the Enterprise has since moved to another nearby building, the original location is still easily identifiable, on the northeast corner of 3rd Street and G Street, by the New Again mural.
