Rancho Yolo is a senior citizen Mobile Home Parks mobile home park. The environment is safe, friendly and community focused. The Homeowners Association sponsors monthly social events in the Community Clubhouse along with exercise classes, workshops, game nights, bookclub, political forums and other activities. Common areas are maintained by park management, while residents are responsible for maintaining their own spaces. The overall feeling is a shady, mature landscape with a lot of sycamores, fruit trees and gardens. It is unlike most mobile home parks.

There are two pools  one for residents only and one for guests, a spa, laundry room, lending library with popular books and videos. Instead of alleys, there are paved paths paralleling the circular streets between coaches. Whether residents walk the paths (usually with their dogs) or power their scooters around the streets, theres always time for chitchat  except for residents who still rush off to work.

The street names within the park follow a theme of Circular Streets  Outer Circle, Broken Circle, Full Circle, Inner Circle  all lead off of the central Diameter Road. Numbering doesnt make much sense  check mailboxes and coach fronts for numbers. Though it is independent living, many residents receive Meals On Wheels and Yolobus provides transportation for residents with mobility impairment.

Mobile homes are available for sale  one resident must be 55 years or older. Management prohibits renting coaches without owner residents.  Some coaches are offered by owner, some by local realtors, and most are offered by a realtor located in a ground level office in the clubhouse. Since the park was developed in the early 70s, a lot of coaches are about 30 to 35 years old and range in price from $20,000 to $150,000. Typically, financing is not available for coaches of this age. After purchasing, some new owners are having the existing coach removed and replaced with new modular homes that are closer to conventional construction, at a much lower cost. Space rental is under $600 (plus gas and electricity) as of 2008. Space rentals are not related to size.

It is a very beautiful place to live with many gardens and trees. There are also many walking pathways through the homes that are secluded and peaceful.  All the residents I have spoke with say they are very happy living there. Users/DagonJones
