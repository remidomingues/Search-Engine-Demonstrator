20080919 12:00:28 nbsp How do you know no one will steal the cameras?  Users/ElleWeber

20080919 12:50:01 nbsp Im guessing its the hope people wont, if not just get an old camera, or even better a disposable and you minimize the loss... Users/StevenDaubert

20080919 12:52:40 nbsp The cameras are cheap cameras from thrift stores and tied to something with string.  I think im also pretty trusting of people.  I did have one camera stolen, but most people read the sign and get whats going on.  Eitherway, its not a big loss and getting cool pictures back when they dont get stolen is usually worth it.

20080920 16:18:26 nbsp Added some new ones today.  Half a roll from Delta of Venus and the remainder from the eggheads by the art building.  A bunch of them came out dark or blurred out so sorry if you didnt make it.  Otherwise, thanks for a fun roll guys. Users/jefftolentino

20080930 11:30:42 nbsp Posted a few more today, some from shields library and some from the coffee house, all on the same roll.  A number came out multiple exposed (yeah, its a shit camera), but some of which Im pretty stoked on.  Users/jefftolentino

20081017 15:49:44 nbsp More up in the main set today.  I had a camera in the coffee house, but had some problems with the flash.  Looks like a lot of people used it, but almost all of them came out black.  :(    Users/jefftolentino

20090408 17:28:44 nbsp One of these is a picture of me! haha I remember finding the camera and debating with a friend if it was a joke, if there was film in the camera, or if it was some sort of psych experiment and we were being taped to see if we would actually take a picture!  Users/mnranns

20110331 20:31:48 nbsp Added some new pics tonight.  It was a beautiful week for random camera.  I left some little friends to guard the camera and keep people from using it.  They didnt to a very good job though.  Users/jefftolentino
