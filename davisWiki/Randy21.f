Ban Randy Banned user

20110609 13:56:57 nbsp Hey, I saw your rather strange rant (William seems to have taken exception and removed it), and I wanted to clarify two things:  Wes didnt go to wiki administrators... he just mentioned it on the temporary discussion page to normal editors like you (yes, youre a full editor and moderator here on the wiki... and yes, discussion pages are cleared and deleted when the discussion ends).  You have as much right and ability to edit as William or Wes does.  As you seem not to realize, you have the exact same right to edit content as everybody else on the entire wiki.  Theres nobody in charge of content.  Thats a common misconception.  Second, what is your goal with that rant?  What injustice are you trying to respond to?  The whole incident was removed from the Phi Delta Theta entry, but it seems youre indicating it should be readded? Or perhaps youre just attempting to pick a fight? What is your goal here?

20110609 15:19:07 nbsp I would really like a public apology from this bouncer right here on this website.  If you will look at what he was say in something that is completely untrue.  Frankly I really wonder why he is on Davis Wiki in the the first place interacting with college students.  I mean the guy was 38 and was calling me 35 when I am 27 and had the nerve to say that I am a degenerate when I was a regular customer a while back. Not only that he is speaking on something that has nothing to do with him and I am sure if I checked into it, it is probably illegal.  I could easily go to the local news and do the story.  Look I have the rest of the day off like this guy does 5 days a week. There is no factual evidence and this guy deserves to apologize.  I have copies of all of my records, I have not been to Prague since April, simply because I am out of town every weekend.  Users/gumby214

20110609 15:21:28 nbsp It really is not a strange rant because it has nothing to do with you.  This guy knows exactly who I am thats why you dont understand. I do not understand why I get blocked for talking about nothing but the truth although this guy surfs the web all day making rumors about students like me while I am hard at work on my finals.  Trust me this is not good for business and you could let this guy know that there will be an article in there about him and the establishment next fall.

20110609 15:22:50 nbsp Thank you Tom, I am new to this.  I just heard my name going around school from some 38 yr old bouncer at a restaurant in Davis.  What do you know? Users/gumby214
  Its the DAVIS wiki... there are people in their 70s... and kids in high school on here.  Its not the UC Davis wiki.  You seem to be VERY confused and highly agitated.  If you want to communicate on the wiki, thats ideal.  If you want to talk on the phone so I can quickly explain to you some of your misconceptions (theres a primer Welcome to the Wiki here), thatd be great  some people, especially people new to the wiki, have problems communicating on it.

   You have not been blocked.  Look, youre totally confused.  Its like youre walking into a pizza place and demanding a massage and a game of basketball.  Call me: (814) 8898845. Evan

20110609 15:27:01 nbsp Hey JabberWocky you finally chimed in to get the joke.  That is exactly the point, it is obvious that you guys have seen what I have written already, but I am not sure why I get a text message in class that there is a bouncer TALKING ABOUT A DEGENERATE WITH A SPIDERWEB TATTOO THAT HE KICKED OUT WHICH HAS NEVER HAPPENED  He needs to suck it up and admit when he is wrong

20110609 15:28:09 nbsp Im not going to give you a call its pointless.  You will be hearing from me eventually. Users/gumby214
  Okay, seriously, this is getting really old.  Either call, or admit youre doing this just to make that Phi whatever frat look bad.  (814) 8898845. Evan

20110609 15:33:59 nbsp Hey, sorry about that Randy... we got disconnected.  Call me back.  Theres a MAJOR aspect youre TOTALLY missing. Evan Users/JabberWokky

20110609 15:35:30 nbsp Moreover, I feel really bad now and seriously want to help you understand how to use the wiki.  Seriously.  I actually, very honestly, want to help you out now that I know youre not a prankster just trying to make the frat look bad.  Users/JabberWokky

20110609 15:39:13 nbsp Here are the things Wes said that are remotely related to this issue:
1) To the user .44: http://daviswiki.org/Users/.44?actiondiff&version26&version15 this
2) http://daviswiki.org/Phi_Delta_Theta/Talk?actiondiff&version233&version132 This edit saying something happened.
3) http://daviswiki.org/Phi_Delta_Theta/Talk?actiondiff&version236&version134 This edit basically saying he wasnt sure whether the photo of Charlie Colato looked like the person he saw.
4) http://daviswiki.org/Phi_Delta_Theta/Talk?actiondiff&version243&version142 This edit saying it wasnt that unusual.

It sounds to me like youre confusing what Wes said with what the anonymous girl(s) who first posted this crap on the Phi Delta Theta page said.  Look at the edit histories for http://daviswiki.org/Users/Jenkelly?actionuserinfo Jenkelly and http://daviswiki.org/Users/JennieMay?actionuserinfo JennieMay and http://daviswiki.org/Users/Mikewilson?actionuserinfo Mikewilson.  To see the edits they made, click on the links in the left column of those pages  oldest edits are at the bottom, newest edits at the top. Users/TomGarberson
   Also note that all those comments have been deleted, which is what I started to tell you when we got disconnected  youre confusing the girls and Wes, and also unaware that the comments were in the Talk page, which is temporary and has been since wiped (after the girls comments were removed). Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, jw.dw@timewarp.org
   Also note that Wes called the person he removed a gentleman and freely admits he doesnt know who it was.  If it was you, the only thing he ever called you was a gentleman.  If it wasnt, he never said he knew who it was.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, jw.dw@timewarp.org
