Raptors are a family of Town Wildlife birds that maintain a wonderful but often discreet presence in and around Davis. During the spring and summer months, Swainsons Hawks (a state endangered species) can be found breeding near Putah Creek.  If you are a raptor fan, venturing out into the agricultural fields during winter can reward you with some spectacular sights and a chance to see a wide variety of species. Check out John Kempers guide to http://www.cvbirds.org/SiteGuides/YF.pdf Yolo Farmland birding. If you just want to get up close and personal with a few large birds of prey, be sure to visit the California Raptor Center on campus.

These raptors can be seen around Davis seasonally or yearly depending on the species.

Whitetailed Kite


This raptor is diving to catch a vole.  I dont know what he is and I hope a bird expert can fill in some details.Users/GrumpyoldGeek The Enterprise wrote a story about a snow owl being spotted south of Davis. This picture look s like the one in the enterprise. Users/JimSchwab

It is a nice picture of a Whitetailed Kite.  Striking birds that often look all white when seen against a gray Davis winter sky, they are one of the few birds to actively hover in place.  You can see them, wings up, flapping to stay in place deciding whether to dive for prey. When doing so, they sometimes look like an angel looking down at us, in my opinion.  They are regularly in the Davis area, but not seen every day. Snowy owls are very rarely seen in the Davis area (thus, it was considered newsworthy).  You wouldnt see one taking a rodent in so much daylight, like with this raptor.  At night, if you see a bird that you want to call a Kite, it is probably a Barn Owl or Great Horned Owl.   NotTires

FWIW, I often see whitetailed kites along the right hand side of the 113 freeway heading south from Woodland towards Davis at about 4:15pm.  Theyre generally doing the flaphover thing that NotTires mentions, looking for something to eat.  Users/AlexPomeranz
Thank you for that tip, Alex.  I think whitetailed kites are rather exciting raptors since you dont see them as often as the regular redtails and coopersplus their plumage is so striking. Users/CaitlinMorrow
