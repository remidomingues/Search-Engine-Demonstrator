20100814 16:04:36 nbsp Hey Ratatat  I noticed you implied that you were unhappy with the service provided at APEX Cycles my shop.  I would appreciate if you could elaborate or swing by the shop to explain as Im always striving to provide the best service as well as the best prices. I apologize if we did not meet your needs recently as you had stated you were happy in the past, and hope that you will reconsider and let me try and win your business back. Users/Aaron.Curtin
