Rate My Contractor is a website where homeowners rate and review Home Improvement & Repair local contractors.  It was Locally Owned Websites founded in Davis and is currently headquartered in West Sacramento.  Contractors set up profile pages to promote their businesses, as well.  The finished website launched sometime around May 1st 2011.  The way RMC makes money is by charging contractors a fee that increases their profile options.

They appear to have a decent variety of contractors in the greater Sacramento area, including Woodland.  There do not seem to be many Davisbased contractors listed, though.
