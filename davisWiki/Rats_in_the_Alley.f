Image(rats.jpg, thumbnail, left) The Rats in the Alley are a shortform improv troupe formed in Solano county (circa 2004) which has performed around 10 shows on and off campus in the Davis area. The groups most recent show and improv workshop took place on December 2, 2006 which was a benefit for UCDs student run drama company Studio 301 (see flyer below). They still have many connections to UC Davis, and many of the members of the troupe will possibly be students over the coming years.  In April, 2008 they performed their 100th show of their almost 4 year history.  Theyre known for Short Form games, and long form scenes ranging from Shakespeare, to entire one act style plays, they also write sketches. Currently two of the members of RITA are performers with the newly established Comedy Spotz Sacramento, a home of short form style improv competition.

There isnt a rivalry between UCDs Birdstrike Theater and the Rats in the Alley although there have been rumors of such among patrons of their shows. RITA has used references to Birdstike as fodder for jokes during their shows, but no public disputes have been reported.
