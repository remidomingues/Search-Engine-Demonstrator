 Winter 2006 Candidate Statement 

What does it take to make a student? Leadership, empowerment, activism and determination (L.E.A.D.) are a few fundamental principles for any student. Following the principles of L.E.A.D., I am dedicated to improving the quality of life on campus and in our community. Through my association with the Campus Center for the Environment (CCE), a steering committee for the twelve environmental groups on campus, I have intimate, but not exclusive, relations with the environmental aspect of this improvement with a few simple, costeffective measures. Fair Trades coffee empowers the farmers with higher profit margins while still supplying a competitively priced, rich, organic coffee. While it was a victory to bring it to the Deli, I feel that it is necessary to expand Fair Trades coffee distribution in the Coffee House. This is but a small step that can be done for our University, I also believe that a Green Building status is an essential measure for new and renovated buildings. Green Buildings are LEED (wiki:WikiPedia:Leadership_in_Energy_and_Environmental_Design Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certified buildings that are based on a US Government ranking environmentalfriendly system, which are built to reduce waste and consumption of electricity and water. I determined to work with the administration to make the new Student Resource Center (SRC) LEED platinum status, the paramount in the ranking system, which will be most cost effective (cheaper) in the long term and supply students with a pleasant ambiance. Diverse experiences are essential for all students, but many students don’t know all that Davis has to offer. An online event calendar, advertising cultural activities in art, music, and theatre in Davis, is a great way to reach the student, and will nurture the relationship between our University and our community. Use this February’s election to improve our University, and enact change with your vote in the campus and ASUCD by voting L.E.A.D. and Ravi Deepak.
