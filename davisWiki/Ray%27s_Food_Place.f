Rays Food Place was a Supermarkets Supermarket in Westlake Plaza in West Davis. Replaced by Food Fair.

Rays Food Place is a supermarket chain with 16 stores in North California. It was founded by Ray & June Nidiffer in 1956 and is headquartered in Brookings, Oregon. They bought it from Westlake Plaza owner Al Smith (when it was Farmtown) then sold it after about ten years. The Davis branch was the farthest south and there are a lot more on the North Coast, around Mt. Shasta, and in southwestern Oregon. The Rays farthest south is now in Cloverdale, California.


I have actually been to a Rays in Mt. Shasta City, and another in Rogue River. I agree that Food Place was a cool name, better than Food Fair. Since my family lives three blocks away, it is just a big convenience store for us. Sad. Users/NickSchmalenberger
