20090310 16:39:42 nbsp I went to Dr. Spores office today for the first time. Everyone there was very friendly.I had a cleaning with Kristina (sp?) and she was incredibly gentle. One of the least painful cleanings Ive had in a while!  They have alldigital xrays and a monitor set up for the patient to see it easily from the chair.  They were able to fix a loose implant with no problem, and were willing to let me wait until next time to have fillings on some very small cavities. To top it off, it was all covered by my Grad Student dental insurance. I would definitely recommend them to someone else. Users/Myra
