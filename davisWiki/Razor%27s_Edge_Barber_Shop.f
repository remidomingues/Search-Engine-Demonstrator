Razors Edge is a local barber shop whose owner is friendly and experienced. He never rushes, and actually takes pride in taking his time.

20090107 11:04:40 nbsp I am so glad I found this place. Best mens haircut in Davis, bar none. Sukh is really nice and takes his time. You might have to put up with him stopping to watch ESPN is theyre talking about the Cowboys or Lakers (his teams), or returning a text message to a friend, but its worth it because hes a really nice guy and wants to do a good job. You simply cant find a better place to get a mens haircut that this place. Ask for a Scissor Cut, which is $17, rather than $13, but its worth it! Users/condemned2bfree

20090301 00:18:33 nbsp Im heading back to the Sacramento area and looking forward to getting a great hair cut at a reasonable price. Users/willri

20090331 20:16:19 nbsp awesome cuts Users/zachadelic

20090529 12:35:32 nbsp Had a great first cut  there a month back, returning soon.  I had quite a mop and asked for a scissors cut giving very general instructions on what I wanted. Users/JamesShearer

20090816 08:45:10 nbsp Sukh is an allaround good guy as well. Whenever Ive been in the area over the last four years, Ive gone to him, and he does well with me and my damn cowlicks. Plus, for kicks, I had gotten a mullet cut just before I came to him for a real one the last time, and apart from a quick ohmanwhatisthat glance, the man didnt even judge. Seriously, though, great guy, really efficient, and has an oldschool barber shop awning. Nifty.

20091016 22:28:37 nbsp This guy gave me the worst haircut Ive had in many years. Uneven, choppy, careless. If thats not reason enough for me never to go back, his behavior was UNBELIEVABLE. While I waited, he cut the hair of two different guys. Strictly clipper jobs, so they went quickly  fifteen minutes total for both. I was under a time constraint so I was paying attention. The next guy, the guy just before me, was a friend of the barber. They got to talking about women they were interested in and the barber would stop cutting the guys hair for long periods of time. At one point they turned and watched the football game on the TV for an entire set of downs. Nearly a half hour had passed since this guy got in the chair. I was about to leave. I figured if he stopped to chat one more time before finishing this guys cut  also a clippers cut, one length, like the two guys who were in and out in seven minutes  and I would go. He finished him up and I sat down as the customer took out his wallet. The barber put the cape around my neck and, you guessed it, started chatting with his pal about a gig he (the barber) has spinning music at some club in town. Another couple of minutes. All in all I spent about seven minutes in the chair and well over an hour in the shop. Im new in town and all I can think is there are some awful barbers and stylists in Davis if so many people call what this rude, talentfree, hack does the best haircut theyve ever had. Users/z

20091123 21:25:51 nbsp I gotta agree with z above me.  Although I didnt have an experience that bad, I did sit in the chair for a good half an hour because he got a text message every few minutes and had to respond to it.  It just felt unprofessional, and the combination of him texting and watching tv made me feel like he didnt want to even cut my hair.  I have stopped going here and instead have been very very very happy with Resler Brothers. Users/MarkPinske

20091203 13:52:48 nbsp Been going here for a long time, always is quick and to the point, always is good and straight. Longest Ive ever spent in the chair is 10 minutes with whatshisname answering text messages and calls, which is quicker than anywhere else Ive gone anyway, so I dont know why those people above say they waited 30 minutes, maybe they just have a whacked out sense of time... I even have a friend in Sacto who comes to Davis just to go here. I will continue going here as long as I live in Davis. Users/GarrettGallegos

20100108 00:58:36 nbsp This barber shop is for men, if your a sissy like the guys that are complaining dont go here.  I get my military cuts here and couldnt be happier. Users/AnthonyFG

20100121 17:19:04 nbsp Sukh is the best barber in Davis, Hands Down! I have been going to his shop for over a year now and have nothing negative to say about him or his skills as a barber; On top of it he has a great sense of humor. He gets the job done right, and gets it done right the first time. It is very apparent that he takes pride in his job and loves what he does. Keep up the great job Sukh. Cheers! Users/NelsonB

20100602 08:35:19 nbsp Love this place. Great hear cut, no nonsense, cool guy. Users/fbarrett

20101007 17:48:22 nbsp I got a solid cut here a few months back Users/StevenDaubert

20101008 21:59:14 nbsp Thought I would reiterate that this shop is awesome! I never go anywhere else. Users/GarrettGallegos

20101118 22:17:31 nbsp Sukh is a good guy.  Haircuts are generally much better than you can get elsewhere for the same price; if he messes something up, hell fix it when you come back in.  If you want somebody to love your skull endlessly for 14 bucks, find another option, but within the constraints of a living wage hes a smallbusiness owner that usually delivers for the price. Users/Flokkenfisch

20110531 15:44:54 nbsp He gave a solid haircut very quick with probably the best price in Davis. Im definitely coming back Users/DanielDeWeerd
   it is the same price as Aggie Barber.

20120401 14:46:38 nbsp Ive always gotten a great haircut here.  Its always pretty quick too.  Theres ESPN playing and generally I just like the atmosphere.  Also the barber is pretty chill and doesnt t ask tons of questions just to make you talk.  5 stars baby!  Users/Bherzberger
