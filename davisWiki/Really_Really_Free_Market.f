What is a Really Really Free Market?

The Really Really Free Market provides a chance to give and get cool stuff for absolutely free.

Simply bring the things around the house you aren’t using anymore, put them in the “free pile,” and look around to see if there is anything you’d like to take yourself.

You are free to contribute almost anything you can think of books, clothing, furniture, music, plants, baked goods, etc.  You can also share any skills or services you might be experienced with (haircuts, bike repair, massages, clothing repair, etc.).  Also, if you would like to play music in a public, acoustic setting, this a great opportunity to do so!  The Really Really Free Market is a great venue for sharing whatever you can.

Note: If your items have not been snatched up by someone else by the time you leave, you can choose to take them back home with you for the following RRFM, or you can leave them to be donated to a local thrift store. Oversized items, however, should be taken home and saved for the next free market (or selfdonated to a local nonprofit thrift store).

Don’t forget to invite anyone you know who might be interested. The more people who contribute to the free market, the better it will be!

Why is this kind of community event important?

The Really Really Free Market (RRFM) movement is a nonhierarchical collective of individuals who form a temporary market based on an alternative gift economy. The RRFM movement aims to counteract capitalism in a nonreactionary way. It holds as a major goal to build a community based on sharing resources, caring for one another and improving the collective lives of all.

We all have skills, ideas, objects, culture, smiles, talents, friendship, excitement, discussions, and many other things to share. If we bring them all together at the Really Really Free Market, we can provide more balanced and full lives for everyone.

As a community we have many more resources than we do as individuals. If we share our resources, we wont need to buy as many new ones. This uses fewer of the Earths resources, takes fewer of our working hours, and leaves us with more time to devote to ourselves and our communities.

Would we all work forty hours a week at one job if we didnt feel we had to? What if instead we worked at improving our individual skills and talents and shared them with each other? We would all spend more time doing things we enjoyed.
