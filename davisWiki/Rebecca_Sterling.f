 Candidate Statement 

Hey UC Davis! We are Rebecca Sterling and Yena Bae, and we are running to be your next ASUCD ASUCD President President and ASUCD Vice President Vice President. Rebecca is a former ASUCD ASUCD Senate Senator, currently the Student Police Relations Chair, and serves on the Justice Reynoso Task Force, and a member of Tridelt. Yena is currently an ASUCD ASUCD Senate Senator, serves on the Chancellors 2020 Initiative Enrollment Committee, and works at the CoHo.

Our message is simple: student needs are not being met or heard; in order to change this we need to come together as a united student body. We deserve a student government that is prepared to represent us and bring innovative ways to move forward improving student life. We have direct plans to make UC Davis the premier campus for student advocacy, sustain excellence in our services for students, reestablish the Davis community, and create a fun and vibrant environment on campus.

We are here to campaign with you, so Aggies, let’s get together and do work.

STUDENTS IN MRAK
This is the time for us to make sure students’ voices are on the table guiding administration. In collaboration with University Affairs, we will assure student representation in every administrative advisory committee.

FLOOD THE CAPITOL
There is no reason why UC Davis UCD shouldn’t be California’s premier spot for student advocacy. We commit to transporting students to and from their legislators’ offices, because as constituents we must be heard. As your student body representatives, we will dedicate ourselves to being in the capitol two days a week, every week, lobbying state legislators in favor of higher public education until California’s budget is passed.

OUR DAVIS
As your representatives, we will make sure students are not left out of discussions of city policy. We will not stand for Picnic Day to be threatened.  We will not sit back and watch a Minor Alcohol Preclusion Ordinance pushed forward.  We will advocate to reform the city’s noise ordinance, renter’s rights, and increase Aggie Pride throughout downtown.

IMPROVE OUR UNITS
WITH CASHLESS TIPSY TAXI Forget your money at home? Well make sure you can use your Visa/MasterCard/etc. to get home safely with Tipsy Taxi.
BY MARKETING  We will establish collaboration among units to directly market our services more effectively. Progressive objectives will include a system wide ASUCD Mobile App, Unitrans ads, and interunit advertising.
BY FINANCIAL CONSULTING We will systematize greater and more objectively informed financial knowledge for our student representatives who manage the unit’s budgets, and unit directors who operate them.

LIVE MUSIC ON CAMPUS
When our city keeps targeting night life, lets bring campus alive! We will provide students a place on campus to listen to local live music, relax, have fun and get together as Aggies.

ADOPTASTUDENT PROGRAM
Being a student is expensive; it’s hard to cook meals on a college budget and daily schedule. We will engage students with the broader community of Davis by pairing students with families to be ‘adopted’ for home cooked dinners.

FIELD DIRECTOR
By creating this job, the Field Director will bring ASUCD’s mission of true student representation back to campus.  This will mobilize the student body to form a unified front to face our collective challenges of constant fee hikes and unreceptive legislators and regents.
