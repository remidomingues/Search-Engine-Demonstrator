20101213 13:14:35 nbsp I commissioned Rebecca to custom make my wedding garment. Rebecca made the process collaborative and enjoyable. The product was STELLAR. I wanted a garment I could wear again and again, not just on the special day, and she succeeded with flying colors. She was professional, prompt, and affordable. She had a great eye for detail. Id recommend her to anyone anywhere! Thank you Rebecca!  Users/themichelle
