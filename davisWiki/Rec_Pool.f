The Address(Rec Pool, 38.539811, 121.761621), short for Recreation Pool, is one of three oncampus swimming swimming pools. Being unheated, it is open daily from April through September (see dates above). It is free for students, and open to the public for a fee. The Rec Pool offers adult and youth swimming lessons. Registration is ongoing and done in person at the Rec Pool or online.

The Rec Pool is one of the largest free form pools west of the Mississippi and features 500,000 gallons of water, a sunbathing island, two large lap lanes (40 yards at the longest point) and two diving boards. The spacious lawn features shade trees and hills, while the deck area holds picnic tables and benches for lounging. The veranda to the west is a nice place for small, private celebrations. The wading pool was a replica of the main pool, with an island in the center, before its removal in 2011 due to leaks.

It is the largest freeform swimming pool on the West Coast at a length of 40 yards. Its a great place for families, as well as a large representation of the students student body. The Rec Pool also has a Rec Pool Lodge lodge which is available to reserve for events. Freeform simply means that it isnt a regulation size  for instance, Hickey Pool is the competition standard short course  but rather built in whatever shape the planners decided.  Despite not being a standard pool size and shape, there are two oddsized lap lanes down the middle of the Rec Pool. They are approximately 40 yards long.

The Rec Pool no longer owns a BBQ and does not permit users to bring their own BBQ, however people do barbecue outside the adjacent Rec Pool Lodge

20080519 21:34:14 nbsp Is there a time of day that one can do laps and not be surrounded by sharks looking for meat? Users/SunjeetBaadkar
  I sympathize. Summer is usually a little better than Spring in my experience since fewer students are in Davis, but as trade off you get a bunch of summer camp kids. Hickey Pool is usually a better bet for lap swimming. Users/SRB
