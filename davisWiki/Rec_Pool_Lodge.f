The Rec Pool Lodge was closed to event reservations as of 9/1/2013. The facility now houses Outdoor Adventures.


Short for Recreation Pool Lodge, this 2story building sits near the Rec Pool. It is probably the coziest building to host an event in, since it is complete with a large fireplace. Users/NickSchmalenberger went to a Christmas party here once. This facility is now the home for Outdoor Adventures, which was previously located next to the Bike Barn by the Silo.
