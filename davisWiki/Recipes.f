 Breakfast 

Egg in a Basket (AKA Toad in the Hole, Spit in the Ocean, Egyptian Eye, or Egg and Toast)
   Supereasy breakfast food.  Some people think cooking eggs like this is easier than cooking eggs alone because the bread adds stability, making flipping the egg easier.

    1 egg
    1 slice bread
    butter
    salt and pepper

     Cut a hole from the center of the bread, leaving all sides intact. You can use a knife, a cookie cutter, or even a glass. Melt a small pat of butter in a frying or sauté pan over medium heat. When the butter is ready, place the bread in the pan and break open the egg into the hole. Cook a couple minutes on each side until egg reaches desired doneness and bread is toasty.  Salt and pepper the egg, if desired.
   Tips:
      To check if butter is hot enough, let a couple drops of water fall into the pan.  If the water bubbles, jumps and sizzles, its ready.  Dont let the butter turn brown.
      If youre afraid of getting eggshell into your breakfast, break the egg open into a bowl and pour from bowl into pan (fishing out pieces of shell first).
      If you didnt mutilate the bread from the middle of the slice when removing it, toss it in the pan and let it cook with the egg.
      For crispier toast you should butter the bread before you put it in the pan.
        I made this today, it was easy and delicious. If one was so inclined, they could throw a slice of cheese on top as well  Users/ArlenAbraham arlen

Tofu Scramble
 Yummmmmm.  Quite possibly the worlds best breakfast.
      2 large eggs
      23 corn tortillas, cut into strips
      1/2 package of firm tofu, crumbled
      1 small/medium white onion, chopped
      Olive oil
      1 bell pepper, any color
      1/2 cup sliced mushrooms
      1 cup baby spinach, washed
      Vegetable oil
      Soy sauce
      Cumin
      Chili Powder
      Garlic
      Pepper
      Oregano

   Sauté onion and 2 cloves chopped garlic in 1 tablespoon of oil over mediumhigh heat for 23 minutes, until tender. Add bell pepper, tofu, a few dashes of soy sauce, and a shake or two each of cumin, chili powder, pepper, and oregano.   Stir around and cook until bell pepper starts to get soft.  Add the mushrooms and spinach, cover, and cook until all is tender, about 5 minutes. Adjust temperature as needed and stir often. Once veggies are softened, crack eggs into a bowl and beat with a fork.  Add a bit of pepper, if desired.  If there is a lot of water in the pan (from the cooked veggies) drain it so that the eggs dont get runny.  Slice tortillas into 1/2 inch strips and throw in pan.  Turn the heat up to high and push the tofu mixture to the sides, creating a little hole in the middle of the pan.  Drop in a tiny bit of oil and add the beaten egg, stiring to scramble.  Once the egg has started to set, stir to incorporate egg and veggies.  You dont need to stir too muchdoing so will result in small, watery lumps. You may want/need to adjust the amount of veggies versus eggs, depending on what you like.  Finish by tasting and adding salt or pepper if desired.  Serve with salsa, pesto, ketchup, or anything you like.
   As with all of my recipes, you can vary what goes into this dish depending on what you like and, more frequently, what you have in the fridge.  Just make sure that the veggies you use are softened before you add the egg, or they will never cook thouroughly.  Because the recipe calls for soy sauce, dont add too much saltif any at all.  This is a Vegetarian Options vegetarian dish, but you can add any type of meat desired, as long as you cook it first in another pan. You can also take out the egg for a vegan dish, or top with cheese.  Feeds 24, depending on what else youre having.

Eggstada  submitted by Users/ArlenAbraham arlen
  basically, an egg on a corn tostada with cheese. youll need:
      an egg or two

      hot sauce
   cook the egg over easy in a fying pan. put some cheese on the tostada, put the egg on the tostada, put some cheese on the egg. throw the whole thing in the toaster oven to melt the cheese (i think the microwave would make it soggy). take it out, add some hot sauce and let it cool down a bit. see Hot Sauce for the dirt on hot sauces.

Tasty Udon Users/MatthewTom
 One dish meal, and although it takes a little longer, it sure beats dried pack ramen.
  1 packet of dried Udon noodles
  1 Egg
  1/4 cup charsiu pork, this is red colored BBQ pork
  2 Inarizushi skins, these are the orange colored fried tofu skins soaked in a syurupy liquid
  1 stalk of green onions
  1 brick of dried mochi, these are pounded glutinous rice cakes
  Shoyu or soy sauce
  Salt
  Sugar
  Mirin, this is Japanese cooking wine
  Instant dashi, this is granulated Japanese fish stock

   Soak the inarizushi skins in water to leech out most of the sugary sweet liquid. Chop it into thin strips.
   Remove any loose skin from the green onions and chop.
   Take the charsiu and chop it into thin strips.
   Boil the water, and then put the Udon noodles in for about 7 minutes.
   After 7 minutes, let the water varely simmer for three minutes, and then strain the noodles, and rinse with cold water until all the excess starch on the noodles is gone.
   Put the noodles into a bowl.
   At this point, preheat a frying pan on medium, fill a pot midway with water and boil and another fill a pot with about 1 to 2 cups of water and heat to boiling.
   After the 12 cup water boils, remove from heat, and add the dashi, soy sauce, sugar, salt and mirin, and mix. (Adjust balance to taste.)
   In the other pot, place the mochi brick and cook until soft.
   Put the mochi in the bowl with the noodles, and then pour in the broth, and add the other toppings.
   Fry the egg in the pan, so that the albumen is completely cooked, but the yolk is still runny. Place carefully on top of udon, so that yolk doesnt break, and enjoy, or itadakimasu.

Red Chicken Sandwich Users/MatthewTom
 Makes one sandwich, and a tasty one at that. Its best to prepare and eat immediately after cooking. The flour and oil helps to create a barrier to moisture, thus the inside stays relatively moist. Be sure to mind safety when handling chicken.
  Have ready:
   Two slices of toasted bread, whole wheat or other heavy bread, such as rye
   A slice of tomato or two, heirlooms are the best because they have a nice flavor
  Chicken ingredients:
   1 Chicken breast
   Some white wine
   Some olive oil
   Cayenne and Paprika
   Cumin
   Pepper
   Salt
   Flour
    Mix the spices together in even proportions in a bowl, and set aside.
    Rub the chicken with olive oil
    Sprinkle the spice liberally over the chicken breast until covered completely with spices and rub the spices into the chicken. Dont be afraid to get your hands dirty, this is the only way to make sure the spices really get into the meat. D
    Lube your hands up with a bit more olive oil and make sure the chicken is still moist with oil. Preheat oven to 350.
    Dip into the flour, and shake off the excess. Place in a pan with a thin layer of the white wine on the bottom. (To be honest, it gives off a nice odor when cooking, and makes the chicken smell nicer when it comes out, but I dont know if this affects the overall flavor much...)
    Put in oven and cook until the meat is completely cooked through.
    Cut the chicken into even thin slices and top with bread and tomato. Enjoy.

     a quarter of a small white onion, sliced thinly
     2 garlic cloves, peeled and gently smashed

Ghetto Chicken
 Anyone who can boil water can make this.  Maybe.
  Cook in saute pan on medium heat until no longer pink/raw: boneless, skinless chicken.
  Add: 12 cans of El Pato Sauce (Chile/Tomato sauce in a yellow or green canthey have it at Albertsons.
  Serve in tortillas, with cheese and lettuce (optional).
 Tip: Add a can of hominy to the pan.  Its corn without the germ and you can buy it in the Mexican food section of the grocery store.

GiardinaMommys Super Duper Tuna Casserole
 This one is super good, super cheap, super easy. It serves between 24 people depending on hunger levels.
  Pour 1 can of white tuna in water into a large bowl.
  Pour 1 can of Cream of Mushroom soup into the tuna mix.
  Take that soup can and fill 3/4 with milk. Pour the milk into the bowl.

  Once noodles are done, pour your goopbowl into the noodles and stir until even.
  Transfer mixture into a  baking pan.
  Shred a large amount of mild cheddar on top of this noodle mix.
  Lightcrumble a lot of Lays Potato chips on top.
  Place in oven at 450 degrees for about 20 minutes or until done.
  Take pan out, crumble more potato chips on top.
  Partition into squares, serve to friends, save for a few days.

Giardinas Quick Curry Mix
 This is super quick, super easy, super cheap, super tasty.
  Grind one big tomato, and a bunch of baby carrots in a grinder, plus one large shallot
  Chop up one group of green onions
  Acquire as much ground beef as is hungry
  Begin cooking in a large wok.

  Add four tablespoons of pesto sauce
  Now add a considerable amount of curry powder, turmeric root, coriander.
  Now add a small amount of salt.
  Now add a medium amount of basil.
  Continue mixing on medium heat.
  At the last minute add a dash of rice vinegar, balsamic vinegar, and fish sauce. By dash, I mean a very small amount.
  Mix once more, toss it on high just until it startsto smoke. Turn the oven off and serve on a plate.

Giardinas Italian Quesadilla
 This one is a little timeconsuming and not the cheapest dinner on the block. Nonetheless, it is incredible.
  Purchase some mild Italian sausages and cut them out of their fatty cases, clumping the mix together like ground beef.
  Mix the ground Italian sausage mix into twice as much ground beef or ground pork.
  Chop up red peppers and yellow peppers super small and toss them into the mix.
  Add two to three large shallots.
  Apply garlic liberally
  Chop six to ten brown mushrooms and add those.
  Chop 1 to 2 batches of green onions.
  Add a small amount of salt.
  Add a small amount of chili powder.
  Add a small amount of Turmeric root.
  Add a small amount of Curry powder.
  Add a medium amount of prebottled tacosauce
  Acquire some roasted chicken and garlic tomato sauce, add liberally. Try to keep the mix as waterless as possible, though.
  Add a few drops here and there of Tapatio hot sauce.
  Cook this mix.
  Spread two sundried tomato basil and garlic quesadillas on the counter.
  Add a good Mexican cheese mix to both sides of the quesadilla.
  Put these in the oven until crispy.
  Remove from oven and skoop your mix onto one quesadilla. Once its packed high, put the other quesadilla on top to form a pizza.
  Sprinkle a considerable amount of Parmesan cheese on top.
  Proceed to get very messy trying to pick it up, or eat it with a knife and fork. It should be crunchy on the outside, wet and gooie like lasagna on the inside. This one is incredible if done right.

Giardinas Quick Mix
 This one is easy, but I recomend purchasing a large Wok for about about $12 at The CoOp
  Create a marination bag with the following ingredients.
   One cube of The CoOp bulk Tofu, chopped into 1/5th inch squares.
   A sufficient amount of ground beef to cure hunger.
   Chopped Portabello mushrooms.
   One finely chopped tomato.
   A good amount of Braggs Liquid Aminos
   Two chopped hardboiled eggs with or without yolks.
   A lot of curry powder.
   A dash of Turmeric.
   Some salt.
   Add rice vineger.
   Add SoyVay Hawaiian Island or Teriyaki sauce.
   Add a small amount of tomato sauce.
  Pack that bag tight, squish it together. Put in the freezer to marinate for a few hours. Remember that youll want a sufficient amount of Liquid Aminos to help break down the other ingredients that will be marinating.
  Once youre hungry, toss this whole mix into a Wok. Cook on mediumhigh, stirring until the meat is cooked through. Remember that pork should always be cooked to completion, otherwise drinking Keystone Light wont be the only thing to make you puke all night.

Chicken Enchiladas
 Ok, so, I am not, by any means, pretending that I can make real, authentic Enchiladas.  The following recipe is my own version of my moms recipe, which she learned to make in Texas in 1972 or so by a white person.  Theyre tasty, but theyre definitely Tex or Cali or somethin.
  Also, this is not a quick and easy recipe.  If you cant boil water, get some help with this one.  Im including it because its tasty and I would never assume that you cant cook.   Users/SummerSong ss


      2 lbs chicken (I use skinless, boneless breast) cut into pieces
      2 medium white onions
      1 lb shredded cheese (cheddar, jack, mozzarella, or mixture)
      1 small can diced black olives
      2 large cans of red enchilada sauce
      1 large red bell pepper
      20 or more corn tortillas
      Vegetable oil
      Cumin
      Chili Powder
      Garlic
      Salt
      Pepper
      Oregano

 Step One:  The Chicken
  Chop one onion and sauté in 1 tablespoon of oil over mediumhigh heat for 23 minutes.
  Add chicken.  Add 1/2 tablespoon cumin, 1 tablespoon chili powder, 3 cloves freshly minced garlic, a sprinkle of oregano, a couple shakes of salt and some pepper.  Stir around and cook until chicken is done, 10 minutes or so.  Adjust temperature as needed, and stir often. If chicken is dry (organic and freerange chicken tends to be drier than massproduced chicken because it is usually not injected with water, which makes the other weigh and, therefore, cost more) you may add chicken broth, salsa, or plain water (1 tablespoon to 1/4 cup).
  Once chicken is cooked, remove from heat.  Grab two dinner forks and shred chicken by pulling apart. If you dont understand what this means, just let it cool and chop it up really little.

 Step Two: The Filling
  Dice the second white onion into little tiny bits.  Put into a big bowl.
  Add the cheese and olives.  Chop the bell pepper, and add that, too. You may add chopped green chilies if you want.  Mix it up with a spoon.

 Step Three:  The Tortilla
  Pour one can of red sauce into a skillet. Heat on mediumhigh until just before it boils.  Reduce heat to mediumlow or low.  Put enough oil to fry tortillas in another pan (1 or more cups) and turn on mediumhigh.  When oil is hot, reduce heat.  Take a corn tortilla and slide it into the oil, avoiding splashing.  Turn with tongs, and cook until softened.  Do not cook so long that the tortilla becomes hard like a taco shell.  Remove from oil, with tongs, let drip, and then submerge into red sauce in other pan.  Make sure the tortilla is coated with sauce, remove, and place on a plate.
  Fill immediately with a couple tablespoons of chicken and of cheese mixture (however much you feel like, really, depending on the size of the tortilla and personal preference).  Roll up and place in oiled baking dish.  To avoid sticking, you may want to pour some red sauce into the dish to coat the bottom before adding the tortillas.   As you make more tortillas, you may need to replenish the oil and/or sauce in the pans.  Make sure that, if you do have to replace one of the other, it is heated before continuing the assembly process.  Tortillas are more likely to fall apart if the sauce is not hot enough.
  Repeat the process until all the tortillas and/or filling has been used.  Place the tortillas singlelayer in the dish.  You do not need to leave room between enchiladas, but you do not want to squish them together, either.  You will probably need more than one pan.  Spoon remaining red sauce over enchiladas.  Sprinkle some cheese (or filling, if you have any left) over the top, cover with foil and bake in a 350 (f) degree oven for half an hour, or until cheese (inside enchilada) is melted.

 Alternatives:
  Instead of using corn tortillas, which involves the twopanoilsoften method, use flour tortillas warmed (and therefore softened) on a dry skillet.  Flour tortillas may also be softened in a microwave. BRAny other meat may be substituted for chicken.  Its important that if you use ground beef, you drain the excess oil from the pan, or your enchiladas will be mushy and swimming.
  I personally dont like green enchilada sauce, but if you do, go for it.  It has chicken broth in it, so be aware that is not vegetarian.  If you use green sauce, try adding avocado to the filling.  Its decent.
  Vegetarian Options include using refried beans or tofu instead of meat.  To use beans, just warm them up and spoon them on the warm tortilla. To fill with tofu, cut one package of extrafirm tofu into tiny little 1/81/4 inch cubes and season with cumin, chili powder, garlic, salt, oregano, and pepper.  Spoon, uncooked, into tortilla and add other filling.  You can also add any vegetables that you wantjust make sure theyre cooked beforehand.

 Sweets & Dessert 
Chocolate Mousse Users/LenaGranik lg
 No eggs or gelatin Just two ingredients!
 The success of this dessert is proportional to the quality chocolate you use.
  10 ounces fresh heavy whipping cream BR8 ounces bittersweet chocolate
     Chop chocolate and place in a double boiler. Stir chocolate minimally until shiny and melted (do not over cook).
    Whip cream in large bowl with electric mixer until stiff peaks form (tip: freeze bowl and beaters and keep cream refrigerated to get best peaks).
    Fold chocolate into cream with rubbed spatula (fewest mixes  fluffiest mousse, does not have to be uniform, streaks of chocolate are OK).
    Take heavy Ziploc bag. Spoon in mixture. Cut corner of bag. Squeeze into individual serving dishes. Chill at least 30 minutes in refrigerator.
    Garnish with mint sprig and/or fresh rasberries (optional).

Peach Popsicles

     3 large peaches, peeled and cut into large chunks
     1/8 cup orange juice
     1/2 cup of low fat vanilla yogurt

Banana Nut Bread
     4 mashed bananas
     2 eggs, beaten
     2 cups allpurpose flour (I’ve also used whole wheat flour, which works fine, but just makes the bread a little dense)
     1/2 cup sugar (I use sugar in the raw)
     1 teaspoon salt
     1 teaspoon baking soda
     options: 1/2 cup chopped walnuts or chocolate chips (or combination)

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Stir the bananas and eggs together in a large bowl. Add the sugar and mix thoroughly. Combine the flour, salt and soda in a separate bowl. Stir to combine, and then add the dry mixture to the large bowl. Stir everything together, and add the chocolate and/or walnuts last. Grease a bread loaf pan (or line with parchment paper) and bake for about 5060 minutes. Test with a toothpick to make sure it has baked all the way through. Makes one loaf.

 Drinks 
Lychee Iced Tea Users/MikeIvanov
  I just made this as an experiment.  Came out delicious!
  Ingredients: Ceylon or other black tea (loose leaf is best), a couple of lychees, sugar, lemon.
  For one serving, brew 1/2 teaspoon of Ceylon tea for 34 minutes in a mug.  While it brews, get a tall glass and fill it with ice.  Into the glass, add the juice of two lychees (I used a garlic press to do this) and a teaspoon or two of lemon juice.  When the tea is ready, add sugar to the hot tea.  I used about 2 heaping teaspoons.  Stir to dissolve the sugar.  Now just pour the sweetened tea over the ice in the glass, insert a straw, and enjoy!

 Quick Fixes 
Ramen
 A classic, but you can spice it up really quickly by throwing in an egg or some tofu.  Also, adding some miso sauce/powder will improve the flavor.

Mi Kho
(Vietnamese Dry Noodles) Tastes better than it sounds, and has less MSG since most of it is drained off.
    12 Cups of Shrimp Cup Ramen cooked according to directions and drained of soup. (You can drink the soup on the side, my dad likes it this way.)
    2 teaspoon of Soy Sauce
    1/2 tablespoon of Lemon or Lime Juice (or more if you like it sour.)
    a pinch of pepper or hotsauce (or more depending on taste. Recommend: use the kind with the chicken on the bottle. Sirriacha is the name I think.)
    Optional: Boiled Shrimp, a sprig of cilantro, dried parseley, left over chicken. The possiblities are endless.
    Combine all ingredients in a bowl and enjoy. Sip ramen soup on the side for lubrication.

Yogurt With Everything Users/LenaGranik lg
 Take to school/work, quick and easy breakfast. No cooking involved.
   1 package any kind of yogurt
   ~1 tablespoon milk
   walnuts or fav kind of nut(s)
   dried cranberries or fav dried fruit(s)

Comments Note: I wasnt sure of the best way to go about this, or if its even a good idea for the wiki. but sinice many people are too lazy to cook for them selves, I figured id have a place for good, easy to cook recipes. ill add some stuff when i get home. we could also have a page on cooking, although im not sure how useful that would be.

20050218 19:42:24 nbsp I agree.... I was actually thinking about this earlier, while nowhere near a computer (oops, obsession).  If people really do put up all their nifty swell recipes, the page will be huge.  Plus, if we have individual pages for each recipe, we can add photos. Users/SummerSong

20050218 20:52:58 nbsp technical question: for sub pages, do they need have the same parent name as the page theyre going on? like recipes:name, or is it recipe:name? Users/ArlenAbraham

I dont think that either way is better; its important that theyre all the same, though.  It sounds to me that if a page says Recipes:Ghetto Chicken (for example) then there would be multiple recipes for Ghetto Chicken on the page.  Alternatively, Recipes:Ghetto Chicken makes sense because the page it links to is called Recipes. In other, totally unrelated news,  Miriam just fell over.  Oops.  Users/SummerSong

My suggestion:  get this page big, THEN make sub pages titled Recipe: Whatever. Users/PhilipNeustrom

20050919 18:46:51 nbsp Just bringing this page back up into the Recent Changes list in hopes that some more crazy super awesome recipes will be added by you wiki folks. Users/VivianPham

20060111 11:03:26 nbsp here is a cooking tip: chewing gum while chopping onions will prevent you from tearing up... you dont want to look like a baby when you are trying to impress a hot date with your fancy italian casserole do you? Users/BlakeHarrison

20060111 15:37:03 nbsp Another onion tip: use a sharp knife.  That way, youll slice the onion cells apart rather than crush the walls together.  As an added bonus, it will be easier to chop, too! Users/JudithTruman

20060304 01:27:14 nbsp To be honest, i have tons of recipes, as i have cooked/prepared over 80% of my meals since i came up to Davis...ill post more soon. Users/MatthewTom

20060323 15:49:24 nbsp Umm... one correction: Egg in a Basket is not the same as Toad in the Hole  the egg/basket thing is an egg fried in bread, while toad/hole is sausages baked in batter. Thanks :) Users/PeterTurner
