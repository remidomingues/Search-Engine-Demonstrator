The Recreation Center preceded both the Activities and Recreation Center and Rec Hall.  It was, together with West Hall, located where the Memorial Union is now located.

Note, the above was taken from side facts from other entries, can somebody verify this is true?  Also, was it the original Rec building for the campus?  A photo might also be nice.
