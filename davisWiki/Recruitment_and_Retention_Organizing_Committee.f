Recruitment and Retention Organizing Committee (RROC) was established by the student body of UC Davis by their vote during Winter 1999 as part of the FACE Initiative Facilities and Campus Enhancements Initiative. Its primary function is to allocate funds for student initiated, led, and organized programming designated for the recruitment and retention of students from historically underrepresented, lowincome, or educationally disadvantaged communities.FootNote(http://sup.ucdavis.edu/k12outreachtut.htm#16 The rest of the information on that website looks sadly outdated, with RROC Representatives listings dating back to 20032004)

The duty of RROC is to oversee the SRRC, a university department staffed and managed by students. RROC consists of six student directors from each SRRC program, serving as the representative for their respective components. ASUCD ASUCDs Pathfinder, and representatives from Graduate Student Association and Student Affairs. 

The first RROC Reps were Laura Akers (Graduate Student Association GSA), Isis Castro (NASU), Jehan Clark (AAAU), Christina Escobar (Pathfinder ASUCD Pathfinder), Yvonne Marsh (Student Affairs), Javier A. Tarango (MEChA), Kao Vang (HSU), and Michelle Villaluz (Bridge) FootNote(Source: Embracing Vision and Evidence of Collective Action: The Formation of the Student Recruitment and Retention Center)
