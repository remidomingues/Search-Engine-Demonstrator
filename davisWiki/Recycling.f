Recycling has been extremely popular in Davis for years and is virtually expected of all who pass through this town. From yard waste to energy and technology, both the city and community strongly support efforts to reduce, The Freecycle Network reuse, and recycle materials. Most recycling efforts within the City of Davis are handled by Davis Waste Removal, who also takes care of our garbage pick up; UC Davis, virtually a city within the city, handles its recycling through various units and student organizations such as R4 Recycling and Project Compost. Campus also participates in http://recyclemaniacs.org/ Recyclemania, a tenweek college recycling competition.

A commonly propagated urban legends urban legend is that Davis was the first city with curbside recycling services.  This is not true; Davis started curbside recycling in 1974, while wiki:madison Madison, Wisconsin had already started in 1967.  The City of Davis and its residents are very recycling friendly, however.

 Overview 
 Conservation 
Whenever possible, residents are encouraged to reduce consumption before assuming that items can be recycled. For example, you can try to opt out of various Junk Mail junk mail.
 Energy Conservation is one of the simplest areas we can reduce consumption and theres the added incentive of lower energy bills! If you havent already converted your household to compact fluorescent fixtures, get with the program! Sure, the bulbs have a higher initial cost, but a much longer life than incandescent bulbs. Compact fluorescents can be used in most light fixtures designed for incandescent bulbs and put out far more light for their wattage.

 Recycling Contamination 
Contamination of recycling bins with garbage is a huge problem. Mixing garbage with recycling significantly increases the cost of recycling by requiring workers to hand sort the entire bin; this decreases the cost benefit to such a degree that its cheaper for most recycling organizations to simply toss the entire bin as waste material.

Please dont put any paper or Styrofoam coffee cups in recycling bins. Dont put trash or food waste in recycling bins. It STINKS when we pick it up and if the contamination is significant (sour milk from a coffee) we must trash the whole bin.

 Curbside Pickup 
Were fortunate to enjoy curbside pickup of recyclable materials in Davis, ranging from yard waste to plastics and cardboard. This is a service that is not offered in many, if not most, American cities. Please check with your landlord, Townies a neighbor, or the http://www.DavisRecycling.org City of Davis Recycling Program to find out what day of the week recyclables will be picked up in your neighborhood. Bulky items can be brought to Davis Waste Removal during the free Bulky Items Dropoff Days, which occur every spring. Contact Davis Waste Removal to find out when the next event is, or ask for a special pickup (fees will apply).

The City of Davis, in conjunction with Davis Waste Removal, provides two bins to each household: a 95 gallon trash bin and a 65 gallon recycling bin that is divided for http://recycling.cityofdavis.org/howdoirecycle/paper paper (not including http://recycling.cityofdavis.org/howdoirecycle/cardboard cardboard) and http://recycling.cityofdavis.org/howdoirecycle/glass glass, http://recycling.cityofdavis.org/howdoirecycle/plastic plastics, and http://recycling.cityofdavis.org/howdoirecycle/metalcans metals. Now all http://recycling.cityofdavis.org/howdoirecycle/plastic plastics, including plastics #1#7 can be placed in the recycling cart and are recycled. It used to be that only #1 and #2 plastics could be placed in the recycling bin and plastics #3, #5, #6, and #7 had to be dropped at Davis Waste Removal for recycling 24/7. Plate and automobile glass are not recyclable and should be discarded as garbage. Recyclable materials are delivered to the DWR facility on 2nd Street where it is sorted by hand, bundled, and sold to recycling plants.

http://recycling.cityofdavis.org/howdoirecycle/yardmaterial Yard material, or green waste such as landscape prunings and grass, can simply be piled on the street just outside of the gutter. Piles should be no more than 5x5x5, but residents can create as many piles as needed. Davis Waste Removal collects yard materials once a week, usually the day before trash pickup.  They will only pickup yard material piles that are located directly in front of a house. Do not place your yard material pile across the street or around the corner from your house—it will not be picked up!

To make disposal of yard material easy for you and safe for others, please place your yard material 18” from the curb or gutter. Please be sure that your pile does not block fire hydrants, driveways or sidewalks. Do not park you car on top of yard waste piles (this may seem like a silly reminder, but heypeople actually do this!) Be aware that your yard material piles can create serious hazards for cyclists; BIKE LANES SHOULD NEVER BE BLOCKED!!!

Acceptable materials for disposal include: grass clippings, brush, leaves, prunings, weeds, discarded floral displays, indoor plants, branches (less than 8 inches in diameter) and Christmas trees.  Do not place yard waste in a plastic bag or any other container.

Please do not place sod, soil, concrete, fruit, flowerpots, florist wire, fencing, bricks or stumps in yard material piles.  Try composting your fruit yourself. Disposal information for other items can be found in the City of Davis http://archive.cityofdavis.org/pw/recyclopedia/atoz.cfm Recyclopedia.

Please be aware that logs and wood building materials are not considered yard waste! One day each week, a truck and Front End Loaders scooper circle Davis neighborhoods, scooping up piles of yard waste into the truck. The Davis Waste Removal drivers handling scoopers are amazingly accurate, and while its not recommended to create piles between Automobiles vehicles, scoop drivers can pick up a load within a foot of a car and never touch the vehicle! Yard waste is delivered to a compost facility where it is chipped and composted.



Streets are swept every week, usually the day following brush pickup. In order to take advantage of this service, please park your car off street on your sweeping day. Check out the http://recycling.cityofdavis.org/residents/singlefamily/curbsidepickupinformation Street Sweeping Map to find out what day your streets are swept.   These street sweepers cost the city of Davis approximately $700,000/year.

If you dont want to leave your http://recycling.cityofdavis.org/howdoirecycle/yardmaterial yard material out in the street for pickup, or if you have a lot of fruits and veggies (which are not allowed in piles on the street), try backyard composting. The www.DavisRecycling.org City of Davis Recycling Program offers a free compost correspondence course for Davis residents. Davis residents in single family homes are eligible for a compost bin for just $10 when they complete the course. Call the Public Works Department at 7575686 to sign up.

 Apartment Recycling 
If you live at an apartment property with ten or more units, you should receive communal recycling service. Recycling carts should be located in or near your trash enclosures. Most complexes have two carts: one for mixed paper and one for plastic, glass and metal containers. Flatten cardboard boxes and stack them next to the recycling carts.

Most apartments properties in Davis have an iBIN Recycling Program iBIN (inapartment recycling bin) in each unit. These iBIN Recycling Program iBINs make it easier for residents to collect and transport recycling from their apartments to the recycling carts in their communitys trash enclosure. You may have seen the iBIN posters around your apartment: Have you been recycling? iBIN recycling! With my inapartment recycling bin!

iBIN Recycling Program iBINs were available at no cost to multifamily properties in Davis. Interested apartment residents, property managers, home owners associations and other multifamily community leaders and residents were encouraged to contact the City of Davis Public Works Department at 7575686 or via email (pwweb@cityofdavis.org) with your property name, address and number of units, to see if your property qualified to receive iBINs for your residents.

 Recyclables 
For an extensive listing of where to take all sorts of different materials, see the Recycling and Donation Directory.
 Cans & Bottles 
Most all cans and bottles we purchase in California have a surcharge, known as the California Refund Value (CRV), added into their price.  Its 5¢ for containers less than 24oz and 10¢ for containers 24oz or greater.  You can redeem this CRV surcharge by bringing your cans and bottles to certain places:

  Davis Waste Removal  located on Second Street, roughly behind the Davis Police Department cop shop. CRV buyback hours are MonFri 9:30am  2:00pm, Sat 8:00am  4:00pm.
  NexCycle, formerly called TOMRA Pacific Inc and previously called rePlanet  located in the Save Mart parking lot, 1900 Anderson Road. Vouchers are good to redeem for purchases at Save mart.
  V.Lopez, 400 Mace Blvd.

If youre not particularly interested in receiving your CRV deposit back, recycling bins can be found throughout town and all over campus; these bins typically have a small round opening, just large enough for the typical soda can or bottle.

According to http://qcode.us/codes/davis/view.php?topic3232_0132_01_060&frameson Davis Municipal Code 32.01.060, it is illegal to remove recyclables from the recycling cartstechnically, these scavengers are stealing.  Scavengers are not only stealing from Davis Waste Removal, they’re stealing from the residents and business owners of Davis, because the revenue generated from the sale of recyclables goes directly back to the rate payers in the form of lower service rates. Recycling service is provided at no extra cost to Davis ratepayers because the revenue from the recyclables subsidizes the cost for the collection. When scavengers steal the recycling, however, they remove that revenue and cut the funding to the recycling program.  (http://recycling.cityofdavis.org/scavenging More information).

 Plastics 
All http://recycling.cityofdavis.org/howdoirecycle/plastic rigid plastics, including plastics #1#7 can be placed in the recycling carts. Rigid plastics are plastics that keep their shape. This includes plastic buckets, flower pots, utencils, caps, lids, toys, clothes hangers...you name it. Larger plastic items such as lawn furniture and large outdoor toys (plastic play kitchens, slides, etc.) can be dropped off at Davis Waste Removal for recycling. These items should NOT be placed in the recycling carts: plastic bags, film or wrap, Styrofoam, expanded polystyrene (food takeout containers, packing foam, packing peanuts), electronics, tires, hoses and other nonplastics.  If in doubt, put it in the trash because contamination of recycling bins with waste increases the cost of recycling to the point that its cheaper to discard the entire binload than sort out garbage.

Prior to 2011 only #1 and #2 plastics were accepted in the recycling bins.

#2 and #4 plastic grocery bags can be recycled at SaveMart (near the west entrance), at the West Covell Safeway and at both Nugget Markets. Nugget Market will take any clean, dry plastic bag for recycling.

Starting July 2007, all major grocery stores are required to take back their plastic grocery bags for recycling (http://www.cawrecycles.org/issues/current_legislation/ab2449_06/ State Law AB 2449). Look for a recycling bin at major grocery stores and recycle your plastic grocery bags!

Styrofoam peanuts (and usually bubblewrap) are always welcomed for reuse at Parcel Dispatch PDQ PDQ downtown, and most other stores that Shipping Services ship things for you, like the UPS Store, Pak Mail, etc.  Large bricks or molded Styrofoam casing generally isnt, although they do accept it occasionally. Although bulky, it is easy to bike a bag or box of peanuts there on your way home, since theyre so light (but surprisingly expensive).

 CDs 
CDs can be recycled at the campus multibin or at Armadillo Music, located downtown. Additionally, you can use them to make coasters, reflectors or disco balls. You can now put them in your Davis Waste Removal recycling cart for recycling.

 Hazardous Materials & Technological Waste 
Batteries, cellular phones and computers contain materials that are considered hazardous waste, and require special recycling/disposal methods. Included in this category are paints, solvents, household cleaners, used cooking oil and automobile fluids. Luckily, our local community is motivated enough that all these can be easily recycled locally.  Any Hazardous materials and wastes that dont have a place below can be taken to the Yolo County Central Landfill during weekly (used to be monthly) http://recycling.cityofdavis.org/hazardouswaste/householdhazardouswastedropoffevents household hazardous waste collection events. Not sure if something is hazardous waste? Check out the the City of Davis http://archive.cityofdavis.org/pw/recycle/atoz.cfm Recyclopedia.

 Fluorescent Light Bulbs 
ALL fluorescent light bulbs contain mercury, and as such, they CANNOT be placed in the trash. In February 2006, the  Department of Toxic Substance Control http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/HazardousWaste/UniversalWaste/General_Public.cfm/ ruled that fluorescent light bulbs/tubes, batteries and electronics are hazardous waste and cannot be thrown away in the trash. When your fluorescent bulb burns out, please be responsible and bring it to a free http://recycling.cityofdavis.org/hazardouswaste/householdhazardouswastedropoffevents Household Hazardous Waste Dropoff Day at the Yolo County Central Landfill.  The landfill is planning on accepting bulbs all the time, but doesnt have the facility yet. Starting July 1, 2009, the Yolo County Central Landfill will accept fluorescent bulbs and tubes for recycling every day during normal operating hours. Bring the fluorescent bulbs and tubes to the scale house. There is a $2.00 convenience charge regardless of the number of bulbs/tubes you bring in. Alternatively, take them to Ikea or Home Depot.

  Due to the hazard of mercury in each fluorescent light bulb, it is highly debatable whether or not they are more environmentally friendly than an incandescent light bulb. The EPA estimates that a typical power plant emits 10 mg of mercury in the process of making enough energy to power an incandescent light bulb for the duration of its life, compared to only 2.4 mg of mercury. Sure, when you add that a fluorescent bulb contains about 4 mg of mercury, the incandescent bulb still seems to have more overall mercury. That is until you consider the fact that most of the energy used in Davis comes from green sources (solar, biomass and hydro power), not  from the typical coal burning, mercury releasing power plants that the EPA is referring to! In Davis at least, switching your incandescent bulbs to fluorescents should not be toted as the best thing you can do for the environment.  Actually, commenter, Davis green power production is on the grid  if we use less power through better bulbs, the green power can displace other power from Sacramento or Solano; if we use more than our green generation produces, we have to buy from the nuke plants or other sources.  Also, the mercury in the bulb is reused, not released to the environment if the bulb is recycled.  The mercury from power generation goes right into the air.

 Automotive Oil 
Automotive Oil can be recycled in a large vat located at Davis Waste Removal Davis Waste Removals 2nd Street facility. This vat is available 247, so theres no excuse to dump that oil in the gutter or elsewhere! Used motor oil and oil filters can be recycled for free at OReilly Auto Parts, Speedee Oil Change & Tune Up, Jiffy Lube, Davisville Express Lube, Davis Waste Removal, AAMCO Transmission. More information about http://recycling.cityofdavis.org/hazardouswaste/usedmotoroil  recycling used motor oil.

 Batteries 
Nearly all types of batteries (maybe not a potato) are considered hazardous waste and should never be put in the garbage! Consumers can properly dispose of batteries in Davis at ACE Hardware, both CVS Stores (used to be Longs Drugs), both Rite Aid Stores, Hibbert Lumber, Aggie Ace,  Nugget, Davis_Food_Coop and the Senior Center. If you live on campus, you can bring your batteries to one of the Multibins on campus. All batteries must be sorted by type (alkaline, lithium and rechargeable) BEFORE you bring them to a site to be recycled. Place each type into a separate plastic baggie for easy handling. More on http://recycling.cityofdavis.org/hazardouswaste/batteries proper battery disposal.

 Cell Phones 
Cell phones can be recycled at any store that sells cell phones. Check out http://www.rbrc.org/call2recycle/ Call2Recycle to find a location in Davis that accepts cell phones and rechargeable batteries for recycling. The Multibin Multibins on campus also take cell phones, as does the Yolo County Central Landfill.  Some nonprofit groups will accept them for use as emergency phones for citizens in need.

 Electronics 
Electronics such as TVs and computer monitors are considered to be ewaste and should not be placed with garbage destined for the landfill. These, as well as CPUs, keyboards, typewriters, cellular phones, fax machines, stereos, VCRs, blenders etc. can be recycled at the Yolo County Central Landfill http://www.yolocounty.org/Index.aspx?page819 free of charge. Microwaves are now accepted for free, but there is a fee to recycle refrigerators and other large appliances.

 Inkjet cartridges 
Inkjet cartridges can often be refilled for half the cost of buying a new one. You can have your ink cartridges refilled at OfficeMax, or swap them for professionally recycled cartridges at Aggie Express without having to wait. UC Davis Campus offers inkjet and toner cartridge recycling for departments through the Storehouse.  You can also throw them into a Multibin on campus. Or, you can trade them in for a ream of paper at OfficeMax. Theres also Cartridge World downtown on 2nd Street. Check out more recycling options for printer cartridges at the City of Davis http://archive.cityofdavis.org/pw/recycle/atoz.cfm Recyclopedia.

 Pens and Markers 

UC Davis will accept any plasticencased device: pens, mechanical pencils, markers and highlighters (the caps too!); however, nothing encased in wood or metal is accepted.  Put your pens in an envelope (intracampus or offcampus) and address them to Pen Recycling.  http://www.dateline.ucdavis.edu/dl_detail.lasso?id14159&fu091412 Details here.

 Bulky Items 
Davis Waste Removal maintains large bins in the parking lot of its 2nd Street facility where community members can recycle items such as http://recycling.cityofdavis.org/howdoirecycle/scrapmetal scrap metal 24/7. Scavenging used to not be actively discouraged and some people left with as much as they brought to the facility. Plastics (#1, #2, #3, #5, #6 and #7), paper, cardboard, glass containers, aluminum and steel cans can also be dropped off for recycling.

Reusable items can be donated to a local thrift store or charity or can be given away by advertising in the free section of the Davis Enterprise classifieds.

Rigid plastics, such as outdoor furniture, children’s toys, sand boxes and play equipment can be placed in your recycling bin (if it fits) or recycled for free at Davis Waste Removal and at the Yolo County Central Landfill in the rigid plastics recycling bin.

Wood waste, including pallets, wood furniture, wood fencing, construction wood waste, tree trimmings, tree stumps (no dirt attached), lumber scraps, and sometimes even yard waste can be brought to the Woodland Biomass Facility for free.  No pressure treated or creosote wood. No wood with leadbased paint. Material is accepted based on current feed stock needs, so please call ahead to confirm material acceptance. Call the Biomass Facility at 6616095 for more information.

Cork Trees Natural corks, bulky if you consume much wine, can be recycled at bins at the Davis Food Coop and Gunrock Pub.

Individuals who currently subscribe to handicapped trash service can call Davis Waste Removal for a special pickup appointment.  As always, Davis Waste Removal offers special pickup service for a fee to residents who wish to dispose of a bulky item. You can also take your unwanted materials to the Yolo County Central Landfill; standard fees will apply.

Still not sure how to recycle or dispose of something? Check out the City of Davis http://archive.cityofdavis.org/pw/recycle/atoz.cfm Recyclopedia for ways to reuse and recycle over 150 different items from dining tables to old bicycles.

Bulky Items DropOff Days are held annually in April at Davis Waste Removal, 2727 2nd Street. See http://recycling.cityofdavis.org/elementsofthecityrecyclingprogram/bulkyitemdropoffevents/bulkyitemdropoffdays for dates, hours and details.

 Where does it Go? 

The Portland Tribune ran http://www.portlandtribune.com/news/print_story.php?story_id130151874902025000 an article that pointed out that most of the paper recycled on the west coast is loaded into ships bound for China.  China has been subsidizing local and foreign paper companies in China to the tune of tens of billions of dollars, shutting down local paper companies.  The article cites this, plus their rising middle class and its appetite for paper products like newspapers and books, in creating a heavy export of paper that the west coast places into recycle bins.

20120524 13:18:10 nbsp Anyone else noticing a disturbing increase in the number of people taking recyclables out of their cans? I live out in Mace Ranch, and every Thursday for the past few months Ive been awoken by someone going through our neighborhoods cans. At first I took a kind of live and let live approach to it, but now its really starting to bug me. Im going to take a picture of the guys next time (its either this guy with a grey early 2000s model Honda Civic coupe with a big wing on it or this new guy I just saw today). I got a picture of the Civic guy a few weeks ago, but I wasnt able to make out his license plate number. This new guy drove a car, too, but I wasnt able to see what kind.

Has anyone else had to do this? Were you able to actually get these people to stop by reporting it to DWR or the police?  Users/CecilioPadilla

20120612 15:39:38 nbsp Thanks for bringing this up Cecilio. The City Recycling Program has a http://archive.cityofdavis.org/pw/recycle/ScavengingRecyclables.cfm webpage about scavenging. It is illegal and the police are cracking down on it.  If you see someone removing recyclables from a cart or bin, get the license plate number of the vehicle and a detailed description of the individual. Take a picture (if you can and it is safe to do so), send the picture to pwweb@cityofdavis.org, and call the nonemergency police number (7475400) to report the crime immediately. Users/jgilbert

20120725 23:02:29 nbsp Regarding late night can pilfering in Mace Ranch, just had the opportunity to meet one of the offenders. Haggard looking 83 year old immigrant. Obviously in need of additional income. I printed out the citys page jgilbert linked to in the comment above. Passed on some cans I had that hadnt yet become the citys property. His age and financial status make it nearly impossible for him to have known that the city is advising police should be called in his case. Users/Darcie

20120831 14:50:34 nbsp Im surprised that there is no place in Davis to recycle a CFL bulb.  I have to drive my bulb all the way to the Yolo landfill in Woodland on a Friday or Saturday.  Apparently Ace Hardware used to accept them, but no longer.   Users/LaurenSutton
 Ikea in West Sacramento takes them.  Im also surprised that theres nothing local, though. Users/TomGarberson

20121126 11:30:54 nbsp Just a note about the other surrounding cities that have local recycling options for CFLsthese collection programs are NOT paid for by the cities, but all paid for by big box storesIKEA, Home Depot, etc. Since Davis has none of these stores, Davis does not have a CFL recycling option. It is VERY expensive to recycle CFLs and no local business is interested in footing the bill at present. The County used some grant funds in 2007 to try to set up a local take back option. Davis Ace Hardware agreed to take back CFLs and fluorescent tubes, but only as long as a State grant would pay for the disposal. Once the grant funds were gone, Davis Ace stopped taking bulbs. Garbage rates already include the cost of recycling CFLs at the landfill during the free HHW dropoff days. Any additional program paid for by the City would mean an increase in garbage rates to pay for it. Users/jgilbert

20130120 17:10:44 nbsp If you lookup the Woodland Biomass facility on google, you get the Woodland wiki which says theyre open 7 days a week dawn to dusk. We went today (a Sunday) they are closed and the sign says they only accept wood 95, doesnt list days, but apparently closed on Sunday. Their phone message says theyre open 94 MF. Also, google maps navigated us to a site west of the freeway, which is wrong.  Users/JaneBF
