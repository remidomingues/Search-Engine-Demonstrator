Davis prides itself on its recycling program, but sometimes things end up in the garbage that could be better utilized in the community.  Heres a directory, organized by item, designed to give people alternatives to just tossing stuff in the garbage.  If you are looking for a way to dispose of a particular item that is not on the list, write it in the comments and someone will look for a solution.

In general, usable goods can often be given away on The Freecycle Network or the Sacramento area Craigslist.  You can list a free classified ad in the Davis Enterprise for any items you wish to give away.  Many household items are accepted at the SPCA Thrift Store, as well as via donation trucks from different organizations that tend to come around relatively frequently to make donations.  Neighbors and friends are also good sources to donate to.  Additionally, at the end of the UCD school year, the university holds a Resource Recovery Drive in order to divert usable goods from landfills. The City of Davis also has an online http://www.ci.davis.ca.us/pw/recycle/atoz.cfm Recyclopedia with over 150 items and ways to reuse and recycle them locally.

Also note that donations made to governmentauthenticated, nonprofit organizations are tax deductible, as long as you request a receipt with a list of items donated and their approximate value.

The Yolo County Central Landfill holds free household hazardous waste drop off days twice a month.  http://www.yolocounty.org/Index.aspx?page437 Click here for schedule of dropoff days.

  Cardboard, corrugated   Small pieces can be flattened and placed in the curbside container, large pieces should be flattened and placed next to the recycling cart. Davis Waste Removal and Yolo County Central Landfill accept cardboard for free recycling.
  Cardboard, packaging  Be careful with this one when recycling.  Cardboard with a plastic or wax coating (such as that used in frozen food packages or milk cartons) cannot be recycled with mixed paper, and including these in with the mixed paper can result in ruining entire batches of paper pulp.  However, if the product that came in the package was not designed to withstand a wet environment, its cardboard packaging can probably be recycled with other mixed paper. Test the cardboard by scraping your fingernail along itif you get a waxy buildup under your nail, its not recyclable. Also try the teartest: Tear the cardboard. If the cardboard will not tear, or if you can tear it and you can see a layer of plastic on top of or inside of the cardboard, its not recyclable.
