Red Light Cameras are automated traffic safety devices that record video and/or take pictures when a vehicle has entered an Intersections intersection on a red light. The photos and video are then reviewed by a police officer and a citation is sent in the mail to the driver.

Dont confuse LEDDAR with red light cameras!

The penalty is $479 (last verified on May 2012) and a point on ones driving record. It was once $370 and a point. The monetary fine has been raised numerous times by the state since RedLight Cameras became legal in California.

In order to be cited, one must cross the intersections limit line while the signal is red. California law requires a clear picture of the driver and license plate in order to be fined. This photo must also match the picture on the drivers license of the vehicles registered owner. Due to these facts, not every violation results in a citation. Californias legislation requires a clear photo of the driver in order to issue a fine and add a point to your driving record as a moving violation. Redlight running is a very serious traffic violation because Tbone crashes are among the most dangerous types of crashes, occurring on the side of a vehicle with little protection for passengers during a crash.


Cameras in Davis

Around or before December 12th, 2005, the City of Davis began monitoring red light violations using video cameras at the following intersections:


  Eastbound Russell Boulevard Russell Blvd at Sycamore Lane Sycamore Ln. (Central Davis)
  Westbound 1St Street First St. at E Street E St.  The Worst intersection in Davis
  Northbound Pole Line Road Pole Line Rd. at 5th Street Fifth St. (East Davis)
  Eastbound Chiles Road Chiles Rd. at Mace Boulevard Mace Blvd. (South Davis)
  East & Westbound Covell Boulevard Covell Blvd at Sycamore Lane Sycamore (Central Davis) sure its not LEDdar ?

There were over 50 warnings sent out in just the first two weeks of the grace period, all caught by only two (of the four that will be active) cameras.  The city has entered a contract with http://www.nestor.com Nestor Traffic Systems in which the city will pay no more than a flat fee or what the cameras actually collect, whichever is less.

The cameras on Russell and First went live around Dec. 13, and 30 days after will be a grace period, in which violators will only receive a photo in the mail and will not be fined for the violation. The cameras on Chiles and Pole Line went live in midJanuary 2006.

Todays traffic cameras can detect vehicle speeds, but their use by Davis Public Works remains a mystery. Loop detectors buried in the ground can also be used to measure the speed of redlight runners.  The traffic cameras installed in Davis are 100% directional, which means if you are going any other direction then the camera does not track you.

Bicyclists can not be cited using Red Light Cameras because there is no legislation permitting cities to do so as well as the fact that cameras can not easily see the registration stickers on a bike.

Apparently, violation video footage will be available on the Internet for review.  The URL for the footage is not yet known.

Success of Red Light Camera Programs

Many municipalities have had different experiences with red light cameras. Cities such as Washington DC saw an increase in accidents. This was attributed to a short yellow light that creates a dilemma zone, making it difficult for a vehicle to clear an intersection safely. If a motorist is traveling inside this dilemma zone while approaching the intersection, he must either proceed through the intersection on a red light or brake very suddenly, possibly entering the intersection on the red. Rearend collisions may also rise as more vehicles screech to a halt to avoid getting a violation. Washington DC also issued false citations, causing doubt in citizens minds whether the cameras were reliable.

The city of Fresno had to shelve its program because their cameras were not taking clear photos of the drivers. The city also wasnt making enough money on the program to justify the continuation of the program.

On the other hand, cities such as San Francisco have had a positive experience with redlight cameras. They report that accidents are down and that there is a positive spillover effect to neighboring intersections where the cameras were installed. They have also withstood many legal challenges in court.

Recently, many cities in California have shut down their red light cameras. The main reason was that the cameras were not cost effective. Cities were losing money to the state, the company that runs the cameras, people not paying the fines, and an increased number of drivers fighting their tickets in court. Cities getting rid of their red light cameras include Loma Linda CA, and Whittier CA. A study in San Diego showed that the city is currently losing money on the cameras as only 23% of the tickets generated by the system actually get paid. The city has no intention on shutting down the system because accidents declined by 32% in the intersections where the cameras were operating.

Controversy

Red light camera programs around the nation have generated a lot of controversy. Many feel the cameras are an invasion of privacy and are another means for Big Brother to spy on citizens and control their lives. Red light cameras represent yet another small step towards complete control of our daily lives by the government. What could be next? Automated speed enforcement?

The cameras are also seen as a revenue generator that is merely disguised as a traffic safety tool. While some cities may be making a lot of money, other municipalities report receiving very little revenue from their programs, breaking even or even losing money. About 40 to 50% of the cost of a ticket goes to the State of California.

Alternatives to red light cameras include enforcing current traffic safety laws instead of investing in costly camera programs which may or may not increase traffic safety and city coffers. Money could also be better spent on more police officers to roam the city instead of stationary cameras positioned at a few intersections.

However, others feel that there is no excuse for running a red light because redlight runners are rarely caught and are putting other motorists lives at risk.

It should be noted that experiments have been tried successfully with no traffic lights as well, and some see traffic cameras as a step in the wrong direction for certain intersections (see the experiment: http://www.wimp.com/trafficlights/).

In addition, several citizens have concerns over the strobe lights that flash to take photos when a redlight violation has occurred. The flash may be too bright, blinding motorists for a split second and causing a major accident. However, the flash may be just short enough to take a good photo of the driver and license plate. The flash may surprise motorists, but not blind them.

Also several motorists have falsely been photographed for making legal rights against the red.

Avoiding Fines

Some citizens have been so frustrated with redlight cameras that they have bought special sprays that prevent your license plate from being photographed.  The spray reflects the flash back to the camera so that your license plate gets whitedout in the photo. The spray is invisible to the naked eye and was completely legal until December 31, 2007.

A new California law took effect on January 1, 2008. AB 801 makes it illegal to sell or use a product (spray coating) that obstructs or impairs the recognition of a license plate by an electronic device operated by police or toll authority. The fine for using a product to obscure a license plate is approximately $146, and the fine for selling such a product is approximately $900.

Conclusion

The success of a redlight camera program hinges on whether the program is able to perform down to the exact letter of the law so the program is able to hold up in court. Cities such as Fresno and Washington DC were unsuccessful because of problems such as wrongful citations, unclear photos and short yellow lights. These problems caused the citizens to challenge the camera program in court.

It is also important that municipalities treat redlight cameras as a traffic safety device rather than a revenue generator. Citizens will be much more accepting of the cameras if they know the program isnt just a scheme to squeeze money out of motorists. This can easily be avoided if revenues from the program are used solely for purposes such as increasing traffic safety or funding local schools. Even if the cameras do not generate money, they may be worth it to deter motorists from running red lights.

Brief Aside

Did you happen to hear about the guy who was cheating on his wife and his wife found out by opening the photo taken by the red light camera when it came in the mail?  Apparently the guy was in a convertible and the lady was in his lap!

Comments Note: The following comments may not make sense because they may have been edited and other comments integrated into the text.


In my opinion red light cameras are absolutely ridiculous. The key principle of our legal system is that every defendant has the right to face his or her accuser in court.  If a witness points you out as commiting an illegal act, you are allowed to question, interogate, ect. the witness when you are on trial.  how can you do this with the camera. If the camera had a technical problem you will be unjustly ticketed.  There is no way of knowing if the camera is right, since the camera cant talk. In my opinion if the camera does not physically present itself at trial you should automatically win (just like when the cop doesnt show).  Joking aside, what happens when someone else who looks similar to you is driving your car?  I personally have a twin who drives the car all the time.  Also, what happens if the car is registered to two different people who look similar, who do they send the ticket to?Users/MattHh
  Ive been issued a redlight camera ticket in San Francisco for a violation that occurred when someone else was driving my car.  On the form they have a blank to specify who was driving your car if it wasnt you.  In my case, the driver of my vehicle was happy to take responsibility, but it didnt seem fair that I should be doing law enforcements job i.e., figuring out who broke the law when they cant.  The proposition that I get stuck with a red light ticket unless I identify the driver of my vehicle sort of flies in the face of how our legal system is supposed to work.  The fact that I can disprove their accusation  that I was not the person driving my car (it doesnt even look like me) should be sufficient.  Users/JaimeRaba jr

Depends what red light company they are from. If its Redflex, then redlight runners are SCREWED. They use videotape and photos of front and back. The video also allows them to see if there were extenuating circumstances, such as the offender being tailgated. – Users/ApolloStumpy

  At what point in the redlight running does the camera issue a citation? Do you have to be completely out of the intersection before it turns red?
    Its a myth that youre safe if your front tires cross the line. So yeah, if any part of your car is in the intersection when its red, that would be bad. From what I see in Apollos comment above, the Redflex cameras take photos and video.  I bet if they say they caught you, they most probably did.   And they also send the photos to you.  You could contest it, but its a hard case to make Ive heard. Unless you can complain about tailgating or something (which Apollo mentioned wont work with Reflex).
    Actually, my understanding is that if the front bumper of your car is over the limit line (or first line of the crosswalk) before the light goes red, its legal for you to proceed on through. The law states that A driver facing a steady circular red signal alone shall stop at a marked limit line.  If I have already crossed that line when facing a steady circular green or yellow signal, then it is a logical impossibility for me to stop at the line when faced with the red. Users/MattJurach
    I learned when i got my commercial drivers license that is also depends on your speed.  If you are going under the speed limit when you enter the intersection then you are alright.  Yellow means slow down and prepare to stop.  So if have crossed the line when the light turns red and are going below the speed limit, then you are abiding the law.  The problem is that most people accelerate when they see a yellow light, thus being in violation when they enter the intersection. Supposedly a lot of redlight cameras also record your speed.  Users/BrianSolecki
    California Vehicle Code section 21452(a) indicates that the significance of a yellow light is merely to warn that a red light will follow. Nowhere does it say that you cannot enter an interesection. Provided that the front of the vehicle has entered the intersection before the light turned red, one has not broken the law at all. There is no reason to speed up, because your only concern (besides safety) should be that you were legally entering the intersection (which you can do on a yellow). This is the same reason that cars turning left—but unable to, due to oncoming traffic—are allowed to remain in the intersection so they can turn even though their light turns red. So feel proud to enter an intersection on a yellow. As Jevan elsewhere on the wiki pointed out, the DMV says, When you see the yellow light, stop if you can do so safely. If you can’t stop safely, enter the intersection cautiously. Users/JaimeRaba jr


20060406 15:13:43 nbsp Some of these redlight cameras are so close to the ground that you could knock them off the pole with a 2x4. Just an observation.  Users/MichaelGiardina

20060407 16:44:27 nbsp http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/Content?oidoid%3A32471 An article that contains all you need to know on red light cameras.

Basically, (at least in Sacramento County) there are two coils in the roadway that activate .02 seconds after the light turns red. You have to cross both for a citation. Each time you cross the coil, it triggers the camera to take a photo showing your car at the intersection when the light was red and in the middle of the intersection as well, shoring up your violation. Red light cameras are a goddamn embarrasment for money hungry cities and counties looking to make a buch while flagrantly violating ones due process at the same time. I dont want to get into the legal sermon now, but any witness testifying at a criminal trial (which traffic court is) needs to have first hand knowledge of the incident in question. Some pig from the CHP who got some blurry photos plopped on his desk does not count.  Users/StanOklobdzija

  As far as I know, bicycles are treated the same as other vehicles... but its not like the cameras will be able to see your license number, if your bike is even registered.  Who would they send the ticket to? Users/BrentLaabs

20060410 20:02:16 nbsp Does anyone know what the camera looking things on top of the lights at the intersection for Sutter Hospital are for?  I thought they were redlight cameras, I guess not. Users/ZacMorris
 I think you might be talking about the little sensors that ambulances and fire trucks use to change the lights as they approach. These sensors are much smaller than the cameras.

20060412 16:25:28 nbsp From a bus driver...  Okay, so heres the deal.  If you cross the limit line, imaginary or painted, before the light goes red, you have the rightofway in the intersection.  This is why you are told to eke out into the intersection when you have a yieldleftongreen.  That way, when the light goes yellow, you can still make the turn without waiting for the next cycle.  You could sit and have a tea party (not recommended) and itd be your rightofway.  When its not: if you are one of those people who feels compelled to go through an intersection, green or yellow, without making sure you can go all the way through.  (I personally hate those people since they block all kinds of traffic just to sit with their butt in the way, grr.)  On that note, be nice to buses.  We are 40 long, a kajillion tons, and can kick your ass; were just opting not to. haha Users/JulieEickhof

   wiki:wikipedia:Seat belt legislation in the United States It is under primary enforcement in California.  No idea if they would try to use them, but they can. Wearing your seatbelt is a good idea for other reasons; a ticket is far cheaper than the loss of earning power because you are missing limbs or are otherwise physically or mentally handicapped due to injury.  jw

Three months went by and I hadnt received anything in the mail so I called the police department. I was told that I most likely lucked out and was promptly told  not to do it again.

20100505 11:32:14 nbsp I recently fought a red light camera ticket and won. I was photographed by the 2nd and E st camera. I was shocked when I received the fine, $505, including traffic school. I decided to fight the ticket and requested trial by mail. I did my research and submitted a not guilty plea, based on hearsay evidence, and asked that the case be dismissed.  I maintained that the officer was not present at the alleged offense, and was not present during the setup, testing, operation or verification and validation of the system. A few weeks later I received a notice that the officer requested the case be dismissed and my bail was to be returned. If I had been found guilty, I planned to ask for a trial de novo, and if guilty there, I planned to appeal the verdict. They were going to have to work for my $505. My guess is it was too much work to actually prove the case and they decided to go after the other suckers that roll over and pay the money.  Users/AllenJones

I saw the gree bike light go on and I stupidly thought I had a green light. Luckily I didnt hit any bicyclist (though they were pretty pissed off). I had a friend in the car and neither of us saw the flash go off. Hopefully I got really lucky.

 I have the impression that people with the ticketing office do a rough review of the pictures  maybe even a video  so there would be good reason for them to decline to issue you a ticket.

20120309 19:13:04 nbsp Today, I made a right turn on First street and saw a flash. I was completely legal. Does this mean Im going to get a ticket?

20120701 10:55:18 nbsp I dont think the camera at Covell and Sycamore is a red light camera. I have looked it up on several websites and all the others are listed, but not this  intersection. Even if you did get a ticket there, no sign is displayed that tells you it is a red light camera which by law there has to be one. So im sure anyone could get out of the ticket just based on that.

That is not a red light camera, most likely its LEDDAR a IR range finding sensor that switches the lights, it also can be configured to do traffic analysis but I do not believe it functions in that capacity for the city

If there wasnt a flash I dont think they took the photo. The intersection is video taped, and then the photo is the proof of the violation (a photo of your front wheels behind the white line when the light is red, and then another photo with it infront of the white line and the light still red) It takes roughly 23 weeks for it to arrive in the mail if they did send you one...
