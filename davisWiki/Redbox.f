Redbox machines are DVD Video Stores rental kiosks that offer DVD and Bluray rentals. DVDs only cost $1.20 and Bluray rentals are $1.50 per night. Some Redbox machines also rent video games. You can return discs to any Redbox machine. DVDs are due by 9PM. If you keep it more than 1 night, it will be another rental cost.

You can get a $1 rental the first time you reserve a DVD online. You need to have the Redbox app for iPhone or Android enabled phones.

Redbox machines are located at Save Mart (2 near the bakery section), both CVS locations, 7Eleven, Circle K, and most recently at both Safeway locations.

Free rental codes: breakroom and dvdonme. You can use each code once per credit/debit card. Use different cards and you can get more free rentals. You do not need to enter an email address, but if you want to get a email receipt you can enter your email address.

You used to be able to get a free rental every first Monday of the month via text message if you sign up on the Redbox website. http://www.redbox.com/textclub (Not sure if this is still going on.)
