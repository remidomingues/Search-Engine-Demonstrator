Redbud Montessori Schools School offers preschool and Child Care before/after school care for children age 2 1/2  6 (includes Kindergarten).

This is a cooperative preschool, and parents are expected to participate in the operation of the school by completing tasks that are directly related to the school program or the school grounds or that provide professional expertise in support of the same. This commitment equals approximately 30 hours per year. Parents may choose a variety of tasks and several tasks may be shared, as long as they complete the total commitment. Parents may opt to pay an extra $30.00 per tuition payment in place of participating as a volunteer, although this is not encouraged.
