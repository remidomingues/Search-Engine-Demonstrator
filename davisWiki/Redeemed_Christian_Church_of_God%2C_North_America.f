The Redeemed Christian Church of God, North America End Time Harvest Center is a new church which opened in December of 2010 in the Court N Cedar plaza at 231 G Street above the Resler Brothers Barber Shop. Their first public appearance in Davis was the week of Christmas, especially on Christmas Eve when they handed out several small Christmas bags with invitations to join their worship service on December 26th and a small Bible which only contained the books of Mathew, Mark, Luke and John.

According to one of the cards handed out at this service:

Our Mission, as Soldiers in the Army of the Lord, is to take an aggressive and militant stand of Faith to see the Church restored and nations reached as we anticipate the return of the Lord.

Little is known about the organization they belong to at this point other than the fact that there are 22 member churches of the http://rccgna.org/ RCCGNA in California, this being the only Harvest Center. The nearest nonharvest center church is in Sacramento.
