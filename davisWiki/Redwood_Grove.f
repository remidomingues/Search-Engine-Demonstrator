20110516 12:57:12 nbsp As a prior tenant, I have great things to say about this Apartment complex and its landlady Chris. The apartment is pretty nice. Our living room was a little smaller than the one we toured, but was adequate for the two years we lived there. Each of the three rooms is a little different. One is the biggest, one has a loft connected to it, and one has its own bathroom. One thing I have to point out here though is that Chris (the landlady) is amazing! Anytime we had an issue with something (the fridge stopped working for instance), she would have it replaced for us within 12 days. For smaller things, like broken sprinklers, she would be outside our apartment herself within an hour or so, fixing things. She doesnt live onsite, but youll see her around the apartments every few days, maintaining the garden, helping tenants, etc. Absolute best landlady ever! Users/JeremyErickson

20120917 22:27:08 nbsp Redwood Grove was a great place to live and Christina Chang was the best landlord I had while in Davis. She was very attentive and always a pleasure to speak with. I recommend Redwood Grove as a great place to live. Users/PaigeKendall
