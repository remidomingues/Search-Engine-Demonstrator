Address(Redwood Lane) is a residential street in Central Davis west of the Davis Senior High School high school running north and south. Its north end is a culdesac next to Covell Boulevard with a wall between and the south end is a T with Antioch Drive. At one time there was bad Telephones phone and Broadband DSL service in this area due to some bad splices: There is a large phone box on 14th Street 14th and I see AT&T the phone company van there so much I think they must live there. There is splice between 14th and Covell that has corrosion and should be replaced and there is a splice in my back yard that causes bad, awful, lousy phone service whenever it gets wet.FootNote(http://daviswiki.org/Cal.NET?actiondiff&version233&version132) At one time there were some large phallic sculputures around this location also.
