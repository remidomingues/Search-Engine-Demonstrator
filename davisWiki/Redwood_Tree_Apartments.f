Redwood Tree Apartments offers onebedroom apartments in what is advertised as a clean, quiet complex.

Prices for Fall 2013 started at $1035 for a onebedroom and $1290 for a twobedroom.  There is also a $1,200 deposit to be made.

The first thing one might notice when stopping by Redwood Tree Apartments is its striking resemblance to an http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Ewok#Villages Ewok village, due to the redwood trees which presumably give the complex its name.  High arches, framing the trees, are another nice exterior feature of the small centrallylocated complex.  The interior of the units are spacious.  The one bedroom units have a sliding glass doors that open to either a 1stfloor patio or 2ndfloor balcony.  Like most apartments towards the center of Davis, Redwood Tree is older, but has undergone  renovations (some units have dish washers).  The tenants tend to be an older crowd.  Most are grad students or married couples, with a few undergrads sprinkled in.  The diminutive size of either the units, the complex itself, or both, gives the complex a more neighborly vibe than larger apartments.  Tenants have been known to make eye contact while passing each other in the hallways, and even  it has been reported  say hello to each other.

Drawbacks:
 Tenants are mostly profs and very serious Ph.D. students. There is some neighborly interaction, but because of the high degree of professionalism (and workloads) among the renters, many keep to themselves.  As noted above, it has been known for tenants to make eye contact, or even say hello to one another. (Drawback?  Or feature for a person in a grind phase of their career?  You decide...)
 The layout of the place is beautiful, but there are a few dark hallways on the ground level. The huge skylights above the covered 2ndlevel walkways alleviate this problem on the upper floor.
 To have a cat you must agree to a $15 increase in rent in addition to a $300 PET deposit.  Is that normal?
 Guest parking is somewhat unreliable, because its a highly desired place to live and all spots are usually assigned.  (All tenants get free assigned spaces with rental.)


The old manager Jim has retired and we have a new manager: Kaveh Shakikhan.

New manager returns calls within a few days if phone number is given!

20061013 11:30:25 nbsp I am a current resident. I have had a bulb go out in the bathroom, and the land lord was knocking on the door to fix it 10 minutes after I told him. As far as the guest parking, there is a lot with 30 spots and there are 30 apartments that are rented at all times! The place is awesome and of course theres no spots in the driveway!! park on the streets like a good host so your guests can park in your spot! Also, the people who live here actually park in front of the viking just around the corner!  LeeBerret

20070627 14:35:01 nbsp Being a resident here, Id say that the first drawback is a plus  well, at least the fact that the tenants are profs, postdocs and serious students. Keeps the complex real nice & quiet and keeps the riffraff out. Having heard the ridiculous noise that most undergrads in this town make at other complex (people, must we listen to your TV/stereo at FULL VOLUME all the time?) Users/ErikKlemetti

20080120 10:15:21 nbsp As a current resident, I highly recommend this place for professionals or graduate students who need a quiet piece of mind after a hard day at the lab. The location is great, you can walk to downtown in 5 min flat. The manager and owner are great. Within a month after I moved in, they gave me a brand new microwave and fridge! Users/SusieHuang

20080309 13:22:43 nbsp So what is rent these days (March 2008)?  Is there air conditioning? Users/SethTara

20080320 00:40:29 nbsp Im having a hard time getting the manager on the phone: does anyone know the rent these days (March 2008)? Users/SethTara

20080904 09:47:43 nbsp I lived here for 10 years (!) before I bought a house in 2008. The place is great, and Kaveh is a really nice manager. This is not a party house, but is instead a small community of people. The apartments have a nice floorplan, toothey are not two or three boring rectangles. The only downside is that gardening options are few (it is an apartment, after all), and you occasionally have to deal with people from other apartments parking in your spot.  Users/BarryRice

20110428 11:20:21 nbsp Just got off the phone: Takes a few days to get a hold of the manager, but very pleasant to talk to. The 1bed/bath units are 645 sq. ft. Fall 2011 rent: $1010/mo, deposit: $1200 + $30 for back ground check. Users/ScottBlock

20110827 17:34:10 nbsp The manager really dropped the ball on us this August. It has been two weeks since we told him the air conditioning was broken, and it still has not been fixed! Hottest month of the year and we are getting COOKED. Users/johnfisher

20120523 11:41:38 nbsp I lived in Redwood Tree apartments for about 1.5 years and was a very happy resident. The apartment complex is home to grad students, universityaffiliated professionals, and some older residents, and is a pleasant and calm environment. There are few or no undergrad residents, and there arent any loud parties. Most of the residents see the respectful quietness as a big perk, and I agree that weekday and weekend nights are so much quieter at Redwood than at other friends apartments.

Maintenance was quick and simple. I didnt really face many problems in my apartment, but when I did (ex. the heater needed adjustment the first time I used it and once the garbage disposal stopped working), the landlord was extremely quick to get things fixed. The landlord (Kaveh) was very helpful and in my experience very easy to reach (even at night, weekends, etc). The property is clearly wellmaintained. The kitchen flooring in my apt was pretty new, and all of the appliances worked well during my stay (AC, heating, stove, refrigerator, etc). No dishwasher in my apt. The laundry room was fine and has 4 coinoperated washers and dryers.

The location is excellent, especially if youre associated with UC Davis. It is a 5 minute bike ride into downtown or to the UCD campus. North of the apartments is a large park and the trails are great for running/exercise. Theres a public library near the park too, if youre not associated with the university. Also, the Davis Coop is 3 minutes away, which is convenient. Youll get a parking spot in the lot, but visitors will need to park on the street (probably over on E St).

All in all, if youre looking for a quieter apartment, I dont know if you can find a better location, landlord, and atmosphere than at Redwood Tree Apartments.  Users/JohnLuidens


20120621 08:21:35 nbsp As a longtime tenant at Redwood Tree Apts, I find it comfortable, quiet and close to downtown. Kaveh, the Manager is friendly and has been very responsive to the requests I have made over the years. I am happy to recommend Redwood Tree Apartments to those who want a clean, professionally run and centrally located complex in Davis.HJ Users/HowardWeiner
