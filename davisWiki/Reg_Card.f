Replaced by the Aggie Card!


 Things you used to get with a Reg Card 
Reg Card was an abbreviation for Registration Card, or Student ID. The Reg Card has been replaced by the Aggie Card. This card is practically a necessity and can be used for such things as:
  Checking out items from the Campus Library Libraries including: Shields Library Shields, Shields Library Reserves Reserves, Physical Sciences Library Physical Sciences and Engineering, Health Sciences Library Carlson Health Sciences and movies from Hart Hall.
  Be used as your form of identification when using credit card at the Coffee House, Trudys, the Silo, the UC Davis Bookstore Bookstore and more.
  Prepaid, unlimited bus service on Unitrans and some lines of the Yolobus  Note: Only if the card has the magical undergrad blue dot
  Entrance to the ARC
  Purchasing credit that is billed on a students account on UC Davis Bookstore campus bookstores, provided you have a second form of photo ID, and are spending more than $5.
  A swipe at the Dining Commons and the Silo (if you purchase munch money).
  Student Discounts and Freebies discounts such as free drinks and cheaper Movie Theaters movie tickets.
  Some Frat Parties admit on the basis of a UC Davis Reg Card.


The Front side of the Card
The front of the ID contains the Seal Of The University, the words University of California; Davis, the students first and last name, student ID number, ID type (Undergraduate, Graduate, Official, etc), number of times a replacement card has been issued, a barcode and accompanying barcode number, and (optionally) a blue dot to indicate whether the holder has paid ASUCD fees (for Unitrans, etc).
  Question:
        Doesnt the dot color represent what email server you are on?  Users/JenniferChu
  Answer:
         No. Its just a blue dot for everyone. If dot colors represented server colors, the grad students would have to have the dot also. Users/StarrOleary
         In fact, if, as a grad student, you volunteered to pay ASUCD fees, youd get a reg card WITH a blue dot.
            The registrars office says that grad students can not get cards with a blue dot.
         Or at least this was true at one time.  Maybe they do something different now.
         Sometimes they make a mistake at the registrar and give graduate students a blue dot anyway. I lost my card three times, and on the third time I got one with a blue dot. Free bus service! Hooray!

The Photo
Reg Cards are notorious for having distorted, illcropped, and overall just bad photos of students.  Student ID photos are taken at summer advising. For a few years during the early 2000s photos were submitted by the student via mail prior to 2005. For the best Reg Card photos, make sure you look fabulous at Summer Advising.
    I think students still can submit photos if they want... and I remember getting my photo taken while I was at summer advising back in 98 Users/JevanGray
    I didnt even go to summer advising. They must have used the photo i submitted.  Users/JessicaRockwell

The Backside of the Card
The back of the ID contains differing items, depending upon what year the student is.  Three years ago the Aggie Logo was on the back.  Then the following year that logo was replaced by the UC Davis Principles Of Community.  A scannable magnetic (black) strip is on the back of all issued IDs.

Replacement
A replacement Reg Card can be purchased for $15 in Mrak Hall.  They take your picture again and deactivate your old ID. If your card gets damaged, the Registrars office can give you a replacement for free, however will not let you retake your picture.

   In the past, new reg cards were be charged to your UC Davis account, but for security reasons, they dont do that anymore. Make sure to bring another method of payment (e.g.: cash, check, credit card...).  Users/EmilyTung
   I went in today to buy a replacement and they gave me the option of retaking the photo or using the old one. Users/MichellePalmer


One more thing to mention about Reg Cards: If you lose yours, your life is essentially over until you get it replaced. As a Freshmen Freshman, losing your Reg Card means you cant eat, you cant get into your dorm and basically you dont exist for the time being. But really, its not that big of a deal. Freshman just get really freaked out when they lose theirs, so its kinda funny to watch.

As of June 1st, 2005, purchases at any oncampus bookstore require a second form of identification.  Users/EmilyTung

You can verify any reg card number at https://registrar.ucdavis.edu/validation/index.cfm. This is how petitions are verified by the ASUCD Elections Committee.  Users/JonathonLeathers

 History 
UC Davis students had registration cards for a very long time, but they werent always in their current form.   Pre1996, the Reg Card was a card with a photo glued on and laminated. The photos were typically first taken at summer advising, and had the mag stripe on back so freshmen could access their dorms and Dining Commons DCs.

The use of the digitized photos occurred in March of 1996.  All students had to line up at the Rec Hall to get their photo retaken for the mandatory switchover to the digitized IDs.  There was also controversy regarding the involvement of wiki:WikiPedia:MCI MCI with the switchover:  MCI had assisted the Administration in the technical side of the new cards, and the card doubled as an MCI calling card, with an authorization code on the front and calling card instructions on the back.  Some students felt this was unnecessary corporate involvement, and feared that MCI would use their personal information in unwanted ways.  There was an additional emotional impact because in order to get the new Reg Card, a student had to surrender their old Reg Card, which sometimes actually had good pictures on them.

The first digitized Reg Cards still had a place to put your Reg Sticker.

A new version of the card called the Aggie Card is expected in Fall 2010. This card is a partnership between US Bank and UC Davis. US Bank realized that they could make a profit off of students by adding a debit card feature to student Reg Cards. When you swipe your card to make purchases, US Bank makes money off of interchange fees charged to merchants. So essentially you are giving money to US Bank every time you swipe your card. Merchants such as restaurants and stores get charged these high interchange fees and in the long run stores will pass that cost back to customers in the forms of higher prices. Student get nothing in return. However, it would be more cost effective if students would avoid using the US Bank card and stick with a rewards card from their own credit union or local bank.


20071010 23:44:19 nbsp Does anyone know if you have to give up your old reg card if you get a replacement? Users/PopTart

20071219 11:45:41 nbsp So, if you kept your undergrad ID with the blue dot on it after youve graduated, can you keep using Unitrans? Users/ChristineLim
  No, free rides are only for paid members of ASUCD. You could try to cheat the system, but it isnt worth the brutal punishment.
   Hehe, the Unitrans rides are never free for undergraduates since they paid for them when they paid the ASUCD fees.  Paul Amnuaypayoat

20080102 14:50:37 nbsp I came here looking for info on where to get a card for the first time. Im guessing Im headed to Mrak hall where replacements are, but maybe someone could put some info about where to get the card for the first time for new clueless students? Users/JeffBronson
  When I was a freshman, they were distributed at what is now called the The Pavilion at ARC Pavilion during the Fall quarter. I am not sure where to go for new students entering during any other quarter, but I would imagine that Mrak Hall would be a good place to call first for confirmation.  Paul Amnuaypayoat

 Incoming freshmen get their cards at summer orientation. I dont know about transfer students, but I assume its at Mrak.  OmgStarKitty
