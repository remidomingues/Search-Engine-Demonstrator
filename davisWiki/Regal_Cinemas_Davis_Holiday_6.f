The Regal Cinemas Davis Holiday 6 is a movie theaters movie theater located downtown.  Compared to the Regal Cinemas Davis Stadium 5 other Regal theater, it is older (it opened in 1989), has six screens, and more traditional nonstadium seats. All auditoriums are equipped with digital sound systems and at least four now have digital projection systems instead of 35mm. Five screens have proper fullwidth scope screens with side masking while one is topdown.

These two Movie Theaters theaters both run a $6.50 Movie Tuesday.  Joining the Regal Crown Club and getting the card also entitles you to a $2 small popcorn on Tuesdays. You can upgrade to a larger size for a little more.  There is also an educational discount (with a UC Davis student or staff aggie card ID card) at both theaters for those nondiscount days (Sun  Thurs Only). You can also pay for your Movies movie and popcorn with a credit card.  They also give military discounts.

 History 
The building now known as the Hattie Weber Museum stood here from 1911 until it was relocated in 1988. It was the towns library until 1969, and after that, the city used it for a variety of purposes, including a brief stint as a teen center.

The Holiday Cinema and Stadium 5 were both originally owned by Signature Theatres. The Holiday Cinema was managed by theater expert Mike Curro from its founding in 1989 to August 1998.  Under his leadership, the Holiday Cinema experienced enormous growth and financial success. In 1998 Julie Vogan took over, causing many longtime staff to leave and imposing low morale amongst those who remained.  Michelle Lindstrom managed it from 2001 until April 2009.  It was under her watch that Regal Entertainment Group bought the Holiday Cinema in 2004 http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2004/04/26/daily30.html along with nearly every theater Signature owned.  The transition from Signature to Regal took a couple years and brought about many changes including significantly higher ticket prices, more preshow advertising, higher concession prices, a new large sized drink  twice the size of the previous large, the replacement of milk duds with butterfingers, and the end of both the Retro Film Revival (2008) and the Free Family Film Festival (2006).  The Holiday is now managed by Janet Smith.

Some Townies still refer to this theater as the old movie theater, and the Stadium 5 as the new movie theater. To those whove been in Davis even longer, this is still the new theater as it was known for the several years of planning prior to its being built.

The theatre building is well integrated with the Regal Cinemas Davis Holiday 6 Parking Structure parking structure that surrounds it because they were built together at the same time.


Ive been to this theatre exactly three times, and Ive been disappointed each time. Dirty prints, poor sound, weird curving screens, seats in the theatre that are useless for watching the movie. I guess they stay in business since theyre the only game in town, but its sad that we have to settle for this. Users/MattCzarnowski mc

Screens 3 & 4 are generally considered to be worse since the door opens right into the lobby without a long hallway first, so every time someone has to go to the bathroom, the auditorium is flooded with light.  Thanks to Regal, concessions are pricey, but its someones job to take away the cheap food you try to sneak in, so be discreet so that they cant see it.  Users/AllisonEriksen

They are almost always hiring, but this is a pretty terrible place to work.  Mostly corporate BS made it unbearable.  Think twice about your other employment options first.   Anon.

Ive been working at this theater for many years now and I dont find anything wrong with working here.  I think it just depends how well you work with others, if you dont like working with other people then dont apply, but if you do then totally go for it.  Also, our prints are no dirtier than any other theaters.  The Retro Film Revival prints may be but thats because theyre original prints.  And with bringing in outside food, I dont remember a theater when I was growing up that let me bring in food, so I find it funny that so many people are surprised we dont allow it.  Were not dumb, if you are going to bring it in dont put it in your purse right outside the door or hide a huge drink in your jacket pocket because those are easily noticeable.  Youd be surprised how obvious people are.  If you do manage to bring in outside food please throw it away after the movie is over because if we have to clean up a bunch of outside food in the auditoriums it just makes us become stricter when checking at the door.  Why should we let you in with a big bag of food when youre just going to leave it for us to clean up?  Anon.

The problem is  where can you build a good new theatre in Davis? You can go to Woodland, but thats Woodland!  gautam

The good news is that Im glad most people like what Im doing with the Retro Film Revival and that I plan on continuing it for as long as people are interested. The really good news is that you dont have to come to my theatre to see these movies if you really hate it so very much. You now have the option of seeing some of the same retro films at the UA Arden Faire (though the series is called Flashback Features there).

Im going to take a moment to address a few of the above user comments now.

MattCzarnowski mentions Dirty prints, poor sound, weird curving screens, seats in the theatre that are useless for watching the movie. Wow, his experience must have really sucked and Im sorry that Im only learning about it now. Im surprised about the presentation comments as thats something we generally get high marks for but I wont dispute that sometimes things go wrong: were shipped a print in rough shape, were training a new projectionist and a problem isnt caught before the film starts, etc. The curved screens thing is only really noticable when sitting in the seats against the walls close to the front of the auditorium so I can only guess that MattCzarnowski attended a sold out show or simply prefers those seats. If available, sit as centered in the auditorium as possible for best picture and sound balance.

The comments by AllisonEriksen are pretty much true in regards to auditoria 3 & 4 (she is a former employee of mine  we parted on good terms if I remember correctly, she just didnt enjoy her job, I guess). The hallways in those houses are regrettably short so light does reflect on the screen. Ive requested inner doors but I think those are really high on anyones repair list (especially when compared to the major repairs some theatres need)so well have to limp a long. In regards to Regal making the concession items pricey well, thats not exactly accurate. The industry as a whole has made the concession items expensive. Its okay to say that, its not a secret. The reason for it, Im told, is because about 85% or so of the money made from ticket sales goes back to the film distributor in rental fees so profit and operating costs have to be recuped somewhere.

Im sorry that Anon didnt like working for me, but its not a job for everyone. I hope theyre happy somewhere else.

Im happy to see that the second Anon posting presents a reasonable picture of the Holiday. My thanks to you.

gautam, Im told that the State theatre in Woodland has a lot of charm, though I havent had a chance to visit it myself. The theatre at the County Fair Mall wasnt so bad when I last visited it (in 1999).

All in all, thanks for the compliments and pleasepleaseplease dont let a bad experience at my theatre become worse by not saying something right away. Come talk to me (talk not yell) and Ill be glad to do what I can to fix things. If that isnt your cup of tea, then pick up a comment card in the lobby (on the wall on either side of the doors) and use any of the 3 different means of communicating listed there in  the easiest being http://www.regmovies.com/corporate/comments.html this site. Despite what some of you may think, Id rather you have the best moviegoing experience youve ever had every time youre here. On the other hand, if you have no complaints and you just want to stop by and say hey, Id be glad to see you. Remember to check out the Retro Film Revival soon  this flight ends on 3/23.  Or, wait a week and check out the next series. Michelle Lindstrom, General Manager, Davis Holiday 6

20060619 12:59:46 nbsp This was a great theater when it opened.  Thank you Regal Cinemas for ruining it. Users/AlanSmithee

20060720 10:29:12 nbsp was I the only one to notice that when the retro Varsity opened next door, Holiday suddenly got a nice shiny marquee out front too?  That one made me giggle. Users/JulienBiewerElstob

20060725 08:39:11 nbsp The employees Ive seen have seemed to be especially vibrant; they seem to try hard to make the experience fun for all. The opposite of the bored employee one might expect. At least from this side (the outside), theyre great. Users/SteveDavison

20060731 14:51:46 nbsp I just wanted to add to my initial comments, since Michelle Lindstrom actually took the time to respond to mine. My last visit was for a late night retro film. This was before they discounted them to $5, so we paid full price for a filthy print that was missing 30 sec segments at multiple points. I felt that such a print was not worth full price, and tried to find a manager after the show, but I was told by a staffer that no manager was there that late. I then sent a letter about my experience, but received no reply. Also, I found the screen curvature distracting from the centerright seats, not just along the walls in the front. If anyone can give me reason to believe that things have changed, Ill try again. Id love to see movies in town. Users/MattCzarnowski

20060807 22:46:48 nbsp The retro films have always been $5.  Thats how they started about a year or so ago and have never changed price.  If you, matt, had paid full price then it must have either been for a different series of films playing (about 2 or 3 years ago there were the almost midnight movies but that was when the theater was owned by Signature) or if it was more recent then you may have paid for the wrong movie and didnt look down at your ticket and realize it.  Also every single night two managers are required to stay until every single patron is out of the building so there is no way when you got out of your movie that there were no managers on the premesis.  Managers have to clean the projectors every night after each show ends, not floor staff workers.  My guess is the floor staff person you talked to didnt realize that the managers were either in the office working on their nightly reports or upstairs cleaning projectors. Users/StargateFan

20061009 19:54:56 nbsp For a fairly small college town like Davis, this theatre is pretty decentespecially since its also an older theatre as well.  I dont believe the building was originally designed to be a theatre, either, so that also very likely has a bit to do with any shortcomings it may have. Users/OnaWhim

20061009 20:00:59 nbsp My scorn goes out to the enter key.  Anyway, Id also like to add in addition to SteveDavisons comment that the employees appear vibrant because theyre generally not unsatisfied with their jobs and they do enjoy the other employees that they work with.  Of course, it could also be said that those who do not enjoy their jobs at this theatre are also the ones who quit so quickly.  However, Id like to very much credit their displeasure of the job to what could likely be an innate laziness within them because its pretty much one of the easiest jobs you can get without having a good bit of formal education and experience.  If you cant handle movie theatre work, then, yeah, stay in school because thats truthfully how you can get an easier job than this. Users/OnaWhim

20061025 22:17:11 nbsp I used to go to this theatre all the time when I was a kid. All the way through college in fact, at which point I moved away. But now Im back and Ive been attending the retro revival nights with my brothers. Let me just say that not only am I getting a total wave of nostalgia just visiting my old stomping ground, but getting to enjoy all these great films on the big screen where the belong...holy cow. Its just a fun experience all around! And yeah, the prints arent always that great, but honestly, youre paying five bucks to see the film! The staff is always friendly, everyone seems to enjoy themselves, and there really is nothing better than watching a movie with a group of people who are there because they KNOW they like the movie already! Theres this kind of camaraderie that happens and everyone jokes and laughs and cries together. To me its five dollars very well spent. Kudos to Michelle and her staff! Users/TinyPants

20061110 15:55:34 nbsp Thank you Regal for taking over the coolest theater in town.  Today I went to see Borat with a few friends.  They were already in the theater so I just went up to the counter and showed them my school ID.  Do you have your regular ID?  Uh, no.  I dont have my lisence yet.  Sorry, the management says you need proper photo ID.  So I call my parents to sign my ticket.  10 mins later, You need someone over 21 to accompany you.  But hes 17.  Sorry, the management...  I walked off.  Great job, Regal.  You just lost a customer.  Moral of the story, always ask for the PG rated film and sneak in. Users/KevinRollins

20061125 12:49:06 nbsp Or...you know...if you ARE 17 or older, you couldmaybe, possiblyjust go get an ID card.  Lets pretend you cant drive.  Lets pretend the DMV refuses to give you a liscence to drive.  They also have these neat ID cards, whichas I understand itcan be acquired by pretty much anyone whos a California citizen.  If you MUST see rated R movies, there are ways to do it.  Also keep in mind that if that bastard sitting at the window refuses to give you a movie ticket, its not because he hates you.  Its because the theatre could get slapped with a big finemeaning, we pay a lot of money and get yelled atif we dont follow the rules that angry parents fought so hard to set in place some years back.  If you want things to change, complain to the people who are even higher up than Regal about this stuff.  Seriously, if you get into a rated R movie without a legitimate form of photo ID in pretty much any part of the country, its because someone isnt doing their job. Users/OnaWhim

20070119 01:01:42 nbsp I, for one, am happy that theyll play older movies. Maybe a lot of theaters do this, but I was thrilled to go see The Matrix tonight with 100+ other die hard fans. Not that I go to the movies often, but for being one of the few times I do, they made it an enjoyable experience. Not sure what their policy is about bringing your own food in, but I was able to sneak in a drink and snacks only semicovertly without any problems. Users/AndrewLeonard

20070129 01:07:24 nbsp whats the deal with screen2? its bottom is about 9 inches higher than the adjacent screens, making the front row seats incredible neck strains, and the sweet spot of the theater pretty far back.  Users/CraigBrozinsky

20070310 01:18:14 nbsp To answer your question CraigBrozinsky, the screen in Auditorium 2 is the same height from the floor to the bottom of the screen as Auditoriums 3, 4, and 5 (actually, 5 is slightly different because the masking moves down instead of out when switching from flat to scope).  Those 4 screens are all 72 off the floor.  The reason that the screens in Auditorims 1 and 6 are slightly lower is that those are our big auditoriums and the screens are significantly larger than all the other ones.  So the screens in those 2 are about 64 off the ground.  Sorry if this caused a viewing problem for you, and I admit that those four smaller auditoriums may not have as great a viewing angle from the front because they generally dont have people in the front rows since they usually house less popular films or films that have been out for awhile.  Hope this helps answer your question.  Users/DavidPetrie
  Thanks!  Users/CraigBrozinsky

20070310 02:10:31 nbsp The regals need to be hung for making us watch ACTUALL comercials before the movie. FFS bring back the slideshow. Only time you will catch me at a regal is on a Tues Users/StevenDaubert

20070313 03:11:28 nbsp In regards to your complaint StevenDaubert, I just wanted to take a second to explain the advertising because a lot of people have grown to hate it (including many employees). http://investor.ncm.com/index.cfm should give you an idea of what an unstoppable juggernaut the advertising industry has become within the film exhibition industry.  Along with Regal, the other two major American theatre chains (AMC and Cinemark) show the same National Cinemedia advertisements.  Unfortunately, the money in this business is so lucrative theres not much we can do about it, so I hope youll be able overcome your dislike of the commercials and enjoy your moviegoing experience (even if its only on discount Tuesdays). Users/DavidPetrie

20070429 11:48:06 nbsp Just another note to add on to my comrade Petries statement. The commercials bring in revenue for Regal, which in theory keeps them from raising prices even further. If you dont like the commercials, dont show up early. The Regal First Look isnt played in the middle of the previews. Users/William.Peacock

20070506 20:51:39 nbsp Does anyone know if this theater or the other Regal uses artificial transfat containing popcorn topping or real butter? Users/Jedron
  As a side comment, you should probably know that butter also contains transfats.  Im also not sure that the process that cows milk undergoes to become butter is particularly natural either.  I prefer butter, and options are always good. Users/JabberWokky jw
  I found out that Odells Pop N Top makes a real butter topping that is transfat free. I could see if Regal could try that. Users/Jedron

20070509 19:19:39 nbsp Both Regal theatres use Golden Delight Buttery Topping, made by Great Western Products Company, with the main ingredient being Partially Hydrogenated Soybean Oil.  The popcorn is cooked in coconut oil and Season It popcorn salt.  Sorry we dont have real butter, but if youd like to request that Regal carry real butter (which would be totally awesome), please visit http://www.regmovies.com/corporate/comments.html and let corporate know how much you hate trans fats.  Also, if youd like to know more about what goes into the popcorn, please feel free to drop by the theatre and well be happy to show you.  Users/DavidPetrie
     Three year later update: As of Jan 1, 2010, California banned transfats in restaurants.  I cant find if it applies to movie popcorn. jw
       The law does apply to movie theaters. There was a study done recently on popcorn from the 3 major movie theater chains(AMC, Regal, Cinemark) and none of the samples contained transfat in the popcorn or in the popcorn topping.

20070712 09:23:30 nbsp I just saw Harry Potter: Order of the Phoenix (great movie, by the way). Im sorry, but I have to get this off my chest. I really really really do hate the commercials before the start of the movieI own a TiVo so I can skip past them at home, and it annoys me that my wife and I paid close to $10 each to now have to sit and watch car commercials in full surround sound and a huge screencant escape them! Help! (Oh, and I can do without the antimarijuana propaganda to boot).

And then, finally the movie starts, and guess what? Ten or so previews to have to watch! Arg! (a couple of the previews looked interesting, and correctly targeted toward the HP crowd, but most of them looked pretty inappropriate).

Not to knock the theater at all. It is one of the cleanest Ive ever been in, the lines even for opening night were not that long, and the sound system I found very good. And it is fun to hear how people react to the movie youre all watching together. Users/DougBarbieri

And, only one person forgot to turn off her cell phone! :)

Okay, I get that ticket prices would be even higher without the added revenue. As a business owner, I understand that you have to make the ends meet to try to have some profit at the end of the month. And I can imagine the cost of owning a retail store in Davis to be daunting. But bear in mind, this sort of thing makes someone like me think twice about going out to see a movie. Personally? Id rather pay more for the ticket and have no commercials. My $.02, as Im sure many students would disagree with me on that one. :)

However, when I consider the cost, the annoying ads (the overpriced food doesnt bother me because I never want to eat at a movie theater), I think I may just wait for the release on DVD next time. :) Users/DougBarbieri

20070712 10:00:19 nbsp in reply to Dougs comments  I think these ads have come in recently (in the last 610 years).   Before that it was either ads for local businesses and music, or a blank screen.
So your $10 dont really go into effect until the actual previews start.  You just get to be annoyed by car commercials since you got there early:) Users/RohiniJasavala

20070712 14:29:12 nbsp I think the blame should be put on the advertisers and the awful commercials that they make. If they would make commercials that arent obnoxiously loud and annoying, people might actually like their products more. I think an obnoxious car commercial would make you avoid that car company. I think Tivo does spoil people these days. Remember when you couldnt fast forward through commercials? Gasp.

The former company, Signature Theatres, that used to run the theater a few years ago never played commercials. There are independent locally owned movie theaters that dont play commercials. In LA, there is a movie theater called the Arclight where they dont play commercials, have only a few previews, have ushers that show you to your seats, and kick out unruly patrons. However, they charge $14 a ticket, but the experience is guaranteed luxury. Users/Jedron

20071114 12:21:04 nbsp Just wanted to let everyone know that the Retro Film Revival will be returning in January as Retro Film Revival presents...8 Films with Tongue in Cheek.

20071216 16:16:04 nbsp It had a limited release starting Dec. 5. Juno will be expanding to theaters nationwide over the next three weeks. Users/Jedron

20071230 21:15:32 nbsp I dont expect much from our local movie theaters  just a place to watch a movie in reasonable comfort. Every time I go the price seems to be a $1 higher, so now I only go if it is something I really want to see and I believe that seeing it on a big screen will be worthwhile. However, the actions of the ticket taker the last time I went really ticked me off.  The guy taking tickets at the door demanded to search my purse!...something about checking for a video camera. The resulting very unpleasant conversation ruined the whole movie experience for me. He didnt succeed in searching my purse and I was upset for much of the movie. What gives!? Users/SharlaDaly

20071230 21:40:16 nbsp Dont feel bad. That sort of thing is happening at movie theaters all over the country. Its some sort of corporate policy where they force employees to search for cameras to prevent piracy. It is sort of militaristic, but its the evil Movie Studios that are threatening theater companies with lawsuits. Movie studios are not making as much money as they hope, so they are blaming piracy for their lack of profit. Movie studios are blaming pirates for their problems, when in fact it is due to their own crappy movies that they churn out. Users/Jedron

20080420 12:06:08 nbsp this theater is horrible! I too was subjected to having to get my purse checked. Total shocker that really pissed me off. First of all there is no clearly visible sign (that i could see at least) that states purses will be checked and even further they do not state cameras can not be let in the theater. I think its utterly ridiculous to check purses. I have never been to a movie theater before where my purse had to get checked. The woman saw my camera, and in no way was going to let me off the hook for not knowing, and not even having a car to put it in. So ridiculous! The woman i was dealing with (apparently one of the managers) was quite rude, and her attitude really made the rest of my experience there unenjoyable. Get over yourselves! This place really sucks. Davis needs a REAL movie theater! Users/ASQWIK

20080624 01:33:17 nbsp Dont go here unless you enjoy somepne waving an orange flashlight around the theater randomly throughout the movie. Somehow they always seem to come in during cruicial parts.
If approach mangement about the issue they respond too bad. That they have to check the exits are closed and no one sneaks in. That is great except for that they are punishing their paying customers for the actions of their non paying customers. Ive not gone back since and never plan to. Users/johnharth

20080624 15:49:38 nbsp Actually, here is the real story. Regal Corporate is responsible for this. Regal will deny managers monetary bonuses if the secret shoppers in the theaters do not see an usher come into the theater and check the auditorium the required number of times per show. The employees have no other option but to comply with Regals corporate policy. It is distracting and disruptive. Feel free to write to Regals corporate office and tell them that this policy is bad and they are losing customers due to it. If enough people tell corporate this, it might cause them to change. Users/Jedron

20081127 00:40:48 nbsp Freakin A dude, i went to see a movie, SAW V, with my friend.  A scary movie indeed and some staff person keeps opening the doors letting the light in, totally ruined it.  Its a scary movie and its only good if you watch it in the dark!! Users/vietgirlwithappetite

20090109 14:40:57 nbsp why the hell is the manager/owner of the theater commenting on this page? Users/boing3887
  Its allowed. The idea is that everyone gets to comment, and then if  someone looks at the page they get the whole picture, rather than one side, and then they can decide for themselves. Users/JoePomidor
  I think that it is good that managers care enough to read these comments. This will help them improve the movie theater experience for customers. I dont work for Regal, but I do know some people who work for them. I learned about the policy of having ushers walk through the theaters and check the auditoriums that way. Users/MaxLucas

20090207 10:10:27 nbsp Boy, Im lucky; I live Salem(Keizer)Oregon and we have great theatres all over town plus new complex in nearby cities.I live for my popcorn fix and esp the orange seasonings added and often stop by and buy just popcorn and go home and watch a rented movie w/the wife.  The employees are usually very efficient partially because some of the managers have been here for years and as a old person(55)I like the clean theatres, video games, and many, many screens we have...plus we often pick different theatres in nearby cities so we can eat at a new restaurant nearby.
Hope things get better in Davis!  Regal has done well for us. Users/rocknrich

20090326 10:33:21 nbsp I dont understand why there are so many negative comments about this theater! Ive gone to this theater my entire life and Ive had nothing but good, or at least decent, experiences. Ive never had to deal with rude employees, messy seats, or other slipups on the part of the management. Davis is a small town, believe it or not, and the theater is just fine for it. On a scale of the Brenden Theater in Vacaville (which is also owned by Regal...I think) being the top and the State Theater in Woodland being the bottom Id say that the Cinemas 6 is much closer to Brenden. I would say the only thing they really need is better seats, but even then, theyre not that bad. Its just a slightly above average small town movie theater.

I was wondering though, do they still do retro films? Users/JamesHaile
  They no longer show retro films. However, it would be great if they brought back them back. Brenden Theatres is independent and is not owned by Regal. Users/MaxLucas

20090414 16:00:48 nbsp To: Michelle Lindstrom, General Manager, Davis Holiday 6. No offense but the seating in this theatre is outdated.  Why on earth would you premier the new Star Trek movie at Holiday 6 and not Stadium 5 on G St? I think I will make the drive to Vacaville or Sacramento in lieu of staring at the back of peoples heads.  Anonymous
  Ive always heard its because Holiday Cinema has better surround sound, but I dont know why this is.  Users/NickSchmalenberger

20090626 23:11:07 nbsp The bigger movies are still played here because the seating capacity is larger than at the 5screener.  That theater was a halfassed job overall it was built mostly to discourage any wouldbe competitors from building any new theaters in Davis little did anyone know the owners would later sell out to Satan, AKA Regal Cinemas.

I worked here from 1991 til 2000 (also filling in at the Cinema 2 and then the Stadium 5 when needed) it was my home away from home.  Ironically I left to work at the Regal Natomas 16 theater in Sacramento, but after working for them for a year and seeing what sort of company they are, I became disillusioned with the movie theater business and went to work in a different area.  I just about died from both laughing and crying when I heard Regal had bought the company Id previously worked for.

Now for the fun facts: construction began on this theater in fall 1988 and didnt open for business until December 22, 1989.  Even then only 4 screens were running.  I wasnt working there yet but I attended the very first movie that started, Blaze starring Paul Newman in theater #1.  Also playing that first week were The War Of The Roses in #6, Family Business in #3, and SheDevil in #2 in the evenings split with The Bear for matinees.  Not a lot of trailers were shown during the first few months the theater was open (some movies ran with no previews beforehand at all), but by the time Id started working there they were receiving plenty and showing as many as possible.  The first movie to be shown on 2 screens was Lethal Weapon 3 in 1992.

The sound equipment was new at the time Dolby CP55s with Atype noise reduction, and QSC amps.  In 1993 the processors in screens 1 and 6 were replaced with CP65s adding SR noise reduction.  DTS digital sound was added to those screens in 1996, the week before Independence Day premiered.  (The DTS unit from the Cinema 2 was sometimes moved over and installed in screen #1 if the movie playing there wasnt in DTS).  The DTS unit in #6 died in 1999, it was taken out for repairs and a Dolby Digital system from a recentlyclosed theater was put in its place and the DTS was reinstalled in #5. Screens 2, 3 and 4 were still only equipped for analog sound by the time I left in 2000, but last time I visited those screens had gotten handmedown SDDS systems from one of the companys other theaters.  Around that time they also changed the way the screens were numbered, but I always consider the one on the righthand side of the lobby as #1. The projectors themselves are old they appear to be 1950sera but were always being maintained so that they worked about as good as new.  I never heard the exact reason for that (Im guessing $$$ was the main one), though when the Stadium 5 theater opened everything there was brandnew.

Those in charge of this theater during its first years were more qualityoriented than those of the big chains like Syufy and United Artists, but in 1993 they had succumbed to greed and installed slide projectors which showed tacky and insulting advertising slides along with movie trivia with often misspelled and inaccurate information.  Surprisingly, very few customers complained about them, which must have encouraged Regal to replace them with video projectors shortly after they had taken over.

Prior to 1998, projectionists had a reasonable amount of control over the music played during intermission, though most of the time it was elevator music CDs.  In 1998 the theater started receiving CDs from MovieTunes, which had a selection of current popular music with an annoying announcer in between.  These of course had to go after the video ad system was installed. Users/AlanSmithee

20090626 23:42:15 nbsp Forgot to mention Surround EX (a separate surround channel for the back wall speakers, matrixed as a centerchannel from the left and right surround tracks) was installed in theaters 1 and 6 in 1999, before the opening of Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.  Theater 5 got it put in a year or so later, though theres never been any advertising for them.  Ive never seen any theaters advertise EX and couldnt tell you which others in the area have it, though Ive found it isnt usually a big deal anyways and most film dont even indicate whether they use it or not.

In January 2000, the theater underwent a minor remodeling where for 3 weeks two screens at a time were closed for a week.  Mainly, the seats were taken out and put back in with the rows farther apart from each other.  The acoustic panels on the walls were taken down and put up in a different arrangement, and the surround speakers on the back walls of theaters 25 were repositioned for digital sound with split surrounds (before there had been an odd number of speakers on the back walls) but digital sound equipment wasnt installed til more than a year later.

20090706 23:43:58 nbsp I got out of a movie (The Proposal) after midnight on the fourth of July. There was no one visible inside the theatre while we were leaving, which made me a little uncomfortable. The street outside was totally empty and quiet. As I went around the corner, I saw someone stealing my girlfriends bike. They only got off with her tire, but if we had gotten out a few minutes later her brand new bike would probably be totally gone.

Please join me and ask this Regal to put bike racks IN FRONT OF THE THEATRE whenever youre there.

Its absolutely retarded to have like twenty bike racks around the corner with horrible lighting and low traffic at night.

FIX THIS REGAL, YOUVE GOT PLENTY OF ROOM OUT FRONT! (Just look at the picture above, and at the Regal 5 which does have bike racks out front.) Users/OrofinJackson

      Do you really think theyre going to tear up the concrete to place bike racks to prevent you from having your bike stolen? Do you have any idea how expensive it would be to rip up the concrete and place new bike racks in? It would probably purchase 5 more of your girlfriends bikes (and yes, even if your girlfriend has an expensive roadbike). Thats not their business, they sell tickets to see movies, they dont sell tickets for bike protection. Get a better lock on your bike.

20100223 20:40:51 nbsp Went here today, thinking that since Avatars been out for over 9 weeks it would be on their $5 Tuesday thing. Found out that its not, because its in 3d (which I actually would prefer not to have) and that also as a result they are charging a 3D fee as well. Im not about to pay $13.50 to see a movie thats been out for over two months. Users/JoePomidor

20100223 21:34:38 nbsp I very much prefer heading over to Woodland for movies.  I dont remember exact prices off the top of my head, but its at least a couple of bucks cheaper at all times at both theaters.  Parking is also a lot better, at least at the one on Gibson, and movies are generally less crowded. Users/TomGarberson

I will defintely agree with that. A matinee in Woodland is $4.50. This price stays the same on the weekends, which Im   not sure is true for Davis theaters. Users/AmLin

20101226 21:04:42 nbsp 4 out of 6 screens now have digital projection systems instead of traditional film, and the remaining 2 are supposed to be converted in the next few months.  This SHOULD result in lower admission prices, since that means they can now operate with one less person on duty, plus theyre making tons of money on all those ads theyre showing now.  The original ticket prices when this theater opened was $6, and even THAT was pushing it. Users/AlanSmithee

  Movie theaters will never lower their prices. They will continue to increase their ticket prices as they have always done. The new digital projectors cost thousands of dollars more than traditional film projectors. The only way for them to recoup the added cost of new projectors is to increase their ticket and concession prices. It was never about saving money for customers, it was always about finding a new justification for price increases. Now that they are showing moves in 3D, they have an excuse to deny customers the $5 Tuesday discount price. The outrageous ticket prices are driving customers away. People are staying at home and waiting for movies to come out on DVD. Why pay $13.50 when you can rent a DVD for $1? Users/MaxLucas
  There has been talk for a few months about the theatres lowering their prices soon for that very reason. The cost has become prohibitive for many and the switch to digital will help them to reduce labor cost as well. You wil begin to see lower prices soon though. Not only are the Davis Theatres losing sales to DVD and pirated copies online, they are also losing to more traditional RL theatres, such as the ones in Woodland which have much lower fees. There was an article in the Aggie and the Enterprise a few months back about the reduction of rates.
   My biggest beef with the theatres is not the general prices (although I think its extremely high and cant really afford to spend $10.00 or more on a matinee which is absolutely ridiculous). My beef is the outright lies told by the staff and the corporations. A lot of films have been coming out in 3D lately and these always cost more ($11.25 now on the matinees). Ask the staff if it is because of them being 3d, the answer is no. Ask them if it is because youre paying for the glasses, either as a rental or purchase, and the answer is again no. In fact they will tell you there is no fee for the glasses because they are to be either reused or recycled.  SO, if you arent paying higher fees because of the glasses, and you arent paying higher fees because they are 3D, just why in the hell are all the 3D prices higher than non3D films?  Answer, they wont say. They just lie through their teeth. THAT, more than the already outlandish prices, is what really irks me.  Users/WesP

    The real bad guy in all of this are the movie studios. Movie studios are the ones that demand a huge chunk of the ticket price. Theaters make very little money off of ticket sales. They make money off of concessions sales. Movie studios put pressure on theaters to keep increasing ticket prices so that the studios make as much money as possible. 3D movies cost more to book from the studios. So the cost gets passed on to customers. The 3D fee is not for the glasses. The fee is for the 3D projection. Regal pays RealD in order to show 3D movies. Most low wage employees do not know how to explain the fee to customers because they dont understand how the entire movie booking system works. It may seem like they are lying, but really it is just that they dont know how it works. There are dollar theaters in this country run by Cinemark in places such as Texas. At those theaters the cost of booking several month old movie prints is very low compared to new movie prints. They can offer tickets for just $1 because the movie studio charges so little for those prints. The theater instead makes money off of concession sales. A $7 popcorn would only cost the theater a fraction of that price. Ticket prices are dictated by movie studios. Users/MaxLucas
  To an extent, Ill buy that. But the theatres still set the prices. For the same Film Tron: Legacy 3d matinee pricing: In Woodland  its $7.50, in San Jose at the AMC its $8.75, Sacramento three theatres ranging from $9.25 to $11.00. Here in Davis $11.25. So the Studios set the prices line doesnt hold true with this. The studios do have a set viewing rate which they charge the theatres which has very little variance from theatre to theatre. They have 5 different tiers for cost (3d or non 3d, number of screens showing the film, age of film, market of film region it is shown in, and key market theatres). The cost of the film after this is completely dependant upon the individual theatres. Normally, these theatres will base it upon average average attendance. So lets say the average film will cost the theatre $3,500.00  $5,500 per month (Yes, this is what they cost the theatres). Opening Weekend you will have the majority of the cinema packed for up to 6 viewings. Average it out per ticket x 100 (going very light on attendance here) x 3 + (per ticket x 50 x3 {matinee})  With the average theatre cost around $10.00 and the Matinee average at 78.00 you end up with this:  ($10.00 x 100 x 3) + (7.50 x 50 x 3) $4125.00 per day opening weekend average. Now by the nex week this total will be reduced by approximately 40%, followed by another 65% drop the following week normally. bottom line is the Theatre makes it money back on the film opening weekend, and the rest of the month is pure profits from the viewing minus employee wages, utilities and so on. Now if the film is a flop, it will do extremely well opening day and the sales will dimish with each following day, however the theatres still make more than fair share of profits for the month off of even these clunkers.

It is costly to obtain the films, up to $5.5k. But if you or anyone else tries to tell me the films are cost prohibitive to the point where they need to charge over $10.00 for any film at present and you actually believe this to be true, I have a good chunk of land to sell you just outside the Bermuda Triangle, youll love it.  Add the extremely high priced concessions in to the overinflated costs of the films and the theatres make out like bandits. Now its time to put your thinking cap on really quick here. If it were truly that cost prohibitive to the point that the theatre can barely afford the film (ie: Only makes money off the concessions on the $7.00 popcorn) do you Honestly think there would be so may theatres around today? I think not. Its an extremely profitable business.  Okay then, if you look at the numbers Just for Regal Cinemas, you know, our friendly local theatre company, the profits for the last decade have steadily risen every. single. year. Theyll talk about profit decline and other fancy ways of saying theyre losing money, but the cold hard fact is that just this one company made http://www.marketwatch.com/story/regalentertainmentgroupreportsresultsforfiscalthirdquarter2010anddeclaresquarterlydividend20101028 $31.4 million in pure profits by the end of Sept. of this year (Q3 alone). Last year, same time, 28.9 million. Each quarter has shown growth for the last decade. They keep talking loss though, how?  Because the profits are rising at a slower rate than they predicted they would by a tune of over 18.5%. So, because their profits are increasing at a slower pace than they wished they would, they call it a decline in sales yet the profits continue to climb. Meanwhile, we get stuck holding the bag, along with all the excuses and pay higher and higher fees every time a new film comes out. You did say one thing I agree with wholeheartedly, the Movie Studios are the bad guys. But hey, theyre just trying to make a buck.  Want to know a secret?  Theyd make a whole lot more with lower ticket prices. Sure, 100 people are jumping in line opening day to see the new Hi Sucker film (and you tell me when was the last time you only saw 100 people on opening night for any film?) and they buy the ticket at $10.00. You just made $1,000.00 in one viewing. Bang!  But now you lower the price to $8.00 and get maybe 150 people to show up. Guess what? You just made an extra 200 bucks. Its simple economics. Sure you will hit a breaking point, a point where it no longer becomes cost effective to lower the price, but it sure as heck isnt $11, like it is now for some films here in Davis, its not $10, its not $9.00  I doubt it is even $ 8.00 but Ill stop there. And these are night time prices people, not matinee.  Bottom line, if the theatre is trying to make you believe they dont make very much off the film itself, its BS, plain and simple. Otherwise wed have a huge popcorn factory that served overpriced kernels and water all day long with no entertainment.  The only truth in the statement that they make more on the concessions than they do on the films is if they are talking about profit % because yes, they might only make 4055% profit off a film theyre showing but they are making  up to 800% profit if not more with every single popcorn or soda they sell. But in actual dollars, not percentages, they make a killing on the films, more money than the concessions. And thats the bottom line. Personally, Im sick of getting screwed and, as much as I want to watch Tron playing right now, or True Grit, coming soon or any other film... Id rather just wait for the DVD or for it to show up on the small screen because at $11.25 its nothing short of rape. Users/WesP

  I saw The Last Legion on opening night in 2007.  Dropped off a friends teenaged kids to see a different movie, and we elected to see the Last Legion.  I think there were, at most, 15 people in the theater on opening night.  Granted, it was one of the worst movies ever, and is an exception.   Users/DavidGrundler

20101227 04:08:36 nbsp Just as an extra point on why its crud to pay so much for tickets in Davis (or anywhere, for that matter):

Total U.S. Ticket Sales 2010 to date:       1,254,569,705
Total Box Office Gross Sales 2010 to date: $9,848,372,189
Median ticket cost in the U.S.: $7.85 (and we pay more than that for a matinee here in Davis where our median cost is about $9.75 now counting Tuesdays, matinees and evening fees)

This is the median price of all the theatres in the US, counting Matinee (which is just over half the cost of an evening ticket at the majority of theatres nationwide) and Evening ticket prices Nationwide.

 And out on top is Regal Cinemas with the highest profit margin of any other theatre with $696.4 Million dollars in 100% pure, after tax, after studio fees and employee wages PROFIT.   Users/WesP

20101227 11:41:43 nbsp Netflix for the win! Users/TomGarberson
  What Tom said.  We hardly ever go out to the movies anymore.  I think I could actually live with the cost if it werent such a miserable experience sitting through all of the ads at the beginning of the movie.  Who profits from those, the theatre or the movie studios or both?  In any case, for me those ads are a dealbreaker.  Its one thing to get ripped off, its another thing to get ripped off and then to be a captive audience for people trying to shove products down your throat.  I havent even been to the Varsity Theater in awhile  at last count, though, they did not show ads (Im not including previews here) and were less expensive.  Is that still true, does anyone know?   Users/CovertProfessor

20101227 12:01:40 nbsp Ed, you are obviously upset and feel it is unreasonable.  So, I just want to know the dollar amount where it goes from reasonable to unreasonable.  Yes, Wes threw out some numbers, but thankfully he included the link.  $696.4 million is not the pure profits by the end of Sept. of this year as he claims.  Read the report.  $696.4 million is the total operating revenues from Admissions, concessions, and other revenue sources before expenses are considered.  Actual profit for Regal (if I am reading the report correctly) for the most recent quarter is $42.6 million, and for the first nine months of the year is $63.9 million.  If you divide the profit out by the number of screens that Regal has, that gives Regal a profit for the first nine months of the year of $9,500 per screen... Users/DavidGrundler
  alright, I looked at the numbers incorrectly and after reviewing them did more research. Lets just look at one quarter (q3 this year ending http://www.stockmarketsreview.com/news/52862/ Sept.2010) The bottom line is this: They have steadily increased the ticket prices while the operating fees have remained virtually the same (dropping only 200k to 27.3 million from 27.5 million for the quarter) and they have managed to increase profits while losing over a million customers compared to the same quarter the previous year.  So whats happening?  Operating fees are decreasing, ticket sales are decreasing, prices are rising and so are total profits. So, my original thought still holds true, reduce the cost of per ticket sales, and they regain (potentially) the million customers they lost in the last year if not gain a lot more. Right now, the actual profit, per screen, per quarter is about 6.5 k with an average profit per theatre, per quarter of 75k+  this gives us the after tax revenue of 31.4 million on 542 theatres per quarter. Key words there being per quarter. Multiply this by 4 quarters (one fiscal year) and its about 300k per annum for each theatre with a decline in attendance of 1845+ guests per theatre (one million/542) now reduce the cost per sale and watch the attendance rise back up including these customers, like myself and many others who have commented here, and either meet or exceed the one million guests lost. Once again, if you thinki theyre losing money right now youre wrong, if you think they couldnt make more money by reducing the fees, youre wrong.  Same goes for concessions.  Used to be, I would go to the theatre and buy a ticket for my group, we would all buy concessions and all sit back and watch the film. Now, if I go do get to go into the theatre (which happens about once a year vs once or twice a month) noone in my group (usually of five to six people) buys concessions either because they are just far too outrageously priced. So again, lower the costs all around and sales will fly, keep raising the cost and the theatres will die, eventually, but not until they becoem so cost prohibitive that only the elite can afford them. I am amazed to find that in this economy the only companies who have found a way to profit with no losses monetarily are Gas companies, Cable companies, such as Comcast, and Theatres.  That will change though. Wes
   While I agree with you that Regal prices are too high in Davis, and Regal would probably do better with lower prices, your numbers are still wrong.  Look again at the report that you link.  First, costs to the theater are going up.  Film rental, advertising, and rent all went up.  Costs of concessions went down.  Second, here is where I think your numbers are flawed.  You said, Right now, the actual profit, per screen, per quarter is about 6.5 k with an average profit per theatre, per quarter of 75k+.  This is true because you are counting the onetime sale of NCM, Inc. common stock that Regal held.  If you drop out this onetime sale, Regal operated at a loss for the quarter.  As you can see, they operated at a loss in the same quarter last year.  If you look at the first nine months numbers, which give a better picture than the most recent quarter, Regal is making approximately $63.9 million profit for the first nine months.  (Roughly $9500/screen for nine months, or $12,675/screen for 12 months.)  Keep in mind that also includes the sale of NCM, Inc. common stock.  That would seem to suggest the average for a sixscreen theater is ~$75,000 per year.  Also, keep in mind that the movieyear does not see even revenues from week to week.  Certain weekends are huge compared to other weekends.  For example, Memorial Day and Fourth of July weekends are usually really big.  It is best to look at the data for an entire year.  Contrary to most peoples beliefs, the profit margin on theaters is quite low.  That is why so many independents have been forced out.  These companies make money by operating thousands of screens and leveraging economies of scale.   Users/DavidGrundler
     I totally agree. Movie theater prices are too high. However, many independent theaters have been closing down over the years. It is very difficult for indie movie theaters to survive with such low profit margins. These days, big movie theater chains are the only ones left in most cities across the country. Most people dont know this, but even the big movie theater chains have had a hard time in the past. Regal, Cinemark, United Artists, Edwards Cinemas, Loews, etc. have all had to file for bankruptcy within the past 10 years. Regal Entertainment Group is the result of what happened when United Artists, Edwards Cinemas, and Regal Cinemas failed. An investor bought these bankrupt chains and formed a new company. The movie theater business is far from stable. It is a risky business. Even now, Regal has a large amount of debt. If movie theaters lose large numbers of customers, we could see major theater chains go bankrupt again.  Users/MaxLucas

20101227 22:07:24 nbsp Maybe prices are high in Davis because of high demand and little competition.  Unless you want to drive out of town, you only have one theater per movie.

Having said that, I rarely go to the movies any more unless its a really good film.  Prices are just too high, and if it isnt something like Avatar that really benefits from being seen in a theater, Id rather wait for DVD or iTunes.  Why watch a comedy or drama in the theater when for 1/3 of the money I can see it at home, pause it, invite people over, bring my own food, and not have people talking during the film?  For nonfx laden films, the home experience is often better and much cheaper. Users/IDoNotExist
