The Regal Cinemas Davis Holiday 6 Parking Structure is one of two multistory parking structures in the downtown area.

Towards spring, Davis High physics classes use this structure to throw unsuspecting eggs off the top floor in the annual Egg Drop contest. Students compete to build contraptions that are supposed to protect eggs from shattering after being dropped from the top floor.


It has cameras on the stairwells, and cell towers bolted to the North West side

As a matter of fact, if you look on the wall on the side thats coming down and out of the parking structure, where its curving, there are numerous scratches on the walls from cars scraping up against the wall because two cars were going past each other in that section.

Not a nice place to park, it offers three hour parking, but the spots are incredibly small. Its almost like they wanted only Smartcars and Mini Coopers to park in this place. This is coming from someone who drives a four door sedan. If you drive a truck or a suburban, good luck, youll need it. The picture above is biased, a Tahoe would go over the parking lines if it tried to park in the center. Users/IdealParadigm
