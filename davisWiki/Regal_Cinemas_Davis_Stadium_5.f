Stadium 5 on G Street has stadiumstyle seating (and smaller theaters and screens than the Regal Holiday), as well as digital surround sound systems in all of its theaters.

Both Stadium and Regal Cinemas Davis Holiday 6 Holiday split what they show, so make sure you have the right theater when you show up. These two Movie Theaters theaters both run a $6.50 Movie Tuesday.  Joining the Regal Crown Club and getting the card also entitles you to a $2 small popcorn on Tuesdays.  You can upgrade to a larger popcorn for a little more.  There is also an educational discount (with a student or staff Aggie Card) at both theaters for those nondiscount days(Sun  Thurs Only). You can also pay for your Movies movie and popcorn with a credit card.  They also give military discounts.

In summer (2011)  Regal Cinemas Davis Stadium 5 Stadium 5 and the Regal Natomas Marketplace 16 in Sacramento showed G and PG rated films at 10:00am on Tuesdays and Wednesdays for $1.  The http://www.regmovies.com/summermovieexpress/default.aspx?zip95616 Summer Movie Express reruns movies have long since left the theater.

If you like sitting in the center of the theater, you should go 3 light grayish half triangles up, and 7/8 seats in.  Users/StevenDaubert
If you have a bad neck, you should try and sit so your vision level is at two thirds up the screen, which normally corresponds to two thirds up the seats.  Users/TerrenceMurphy

20060619 14:26:07 nbsp This theater really sucks the screens are very small, and before the movie starts they show commercials from a video projector.  If its a widescreen movie, a curtain comes down from the top and actually makes the screen SMALLER for the movie than for the commercials! Not what a theater should be at all, and we lost the old Cinema 2 for this! Users/AlanSmithee

20060619 15:29:22 nbsp I much prefer this theater to F st.  It tends to be cleaner, the seats are in better condition and in better locations, and the crowds are smaller so it is less likely youll get that one annoying person who thinks theyre in a cafe.  Unfortunately, they stick all of the high demand movies at F st (presumably because the theaters are bigger there).  The smaller screen size doesnt bother me. Users/AlexPomeranz

20070505 16:47:26 nbsp This theater has comfortable stadium seating for great sightlines and a very good digital surround sound system. Users/Jedron

20070601 21:19:47 nbsp We went and saw POTC 3 yesterday. Everything was great but the food is way over priced. It was $16 for a popcorn and 2 sodas. Just crazy!!!

20070604 02:34:42 nbsp Thanks for posting the photo of the theater! Users/Jedron

20071110 15:02:59 nbsp This theater is nice enough, but unlike many stadium style theaters, the armrests do not lift up to make loveseats and the seats in the stepped part do not have any recline in them whatsoever, although they are still comfortable. The most disturbing thing about this theater was the lack of soundproofing. In Auditorium 1, the movie is noticeably disrupted every time a train rumbles by outside. If it was a bargain theater, it wouldnt be a big deal, but for $9.50 plus a small fortune for popcorn, I dont want to hear the trains. Users/RyanCoates

20080313 16:20:31 nbsp I was a projectionist at this theater for a couple years. Yes, when the movie print is in CinemaScope (widescreen) format, the curtain lowers to cover the portion of the screen that is not being used. Think of it like the black bars on your TV when you watch a movie in widescreen format. Users/Default77

20080503 11:35:58 nbsp when you sit down, be sure to go to the tip of the third grey triangle, and then go 7 seats in dead center of theatre >:D Users/StevenDaubert

20090222 22:47:18 nbsp Has anyone ever noticed the Davis theaters dont often show many movies with AfricanAmerican casts? For example this weekend Tyler Perrys Madea Goes to Jail topped the box office with over 41 million, without help from one screen in Davis. Users/GreezySweezy
  It probably has something to do with a lack of a big enough audience to make showing the movie profitable. Tyler Perrys movies are geared toward an almost exclusively black audience. That is profitable for theaters in Sacramento and the Bay Area, where there are large black populations, but Davis theaters usually arent going to show Tyler Perry movies because theres not enough black people here to make it profitable. Its not racism, if thats what youre suggesting. Users/PeteWillits
  Plus Tyler Perry is just plain not funny Users/Arcturus

  Davis doesnt have a large black population, and thus since Tyler Perrys target is mainly an AfricanAmerican audience, it wouldnt be profitable to show the movie here. Stop trying to play the race card.

20090907 23:29:56 nbsp Tyler Perry. ARE YOU Serious? WOW. GUY writes about the same crap over and over again. Yea NOT FUNNY what so ever. And stop playing the RACE CARD .Hes movies are SO ANNOYING. PERIOD. Users/Macco

20100808 19:01:14 nbsp Convenient, and priced accordingly. If you have an extra twenty minutes to spare, it is almost always worth traveling out of Davis to see a movie. Users/TerrenceMurphy

20110113 00:01:10 nbsp Great customer service! Went here with a gift certificate that I thought would work at this theater but the ticket attendant said it is not for their theater but that they will honor it anyways. Wow! Users/MMAC

20110325 18:57:42 nbsp Looks like few people have commented here anyone know if they are still using 35mm here or DLP? The projectors were brandnew when installed in 1999. Users/AlanSmithee
 Fandango shows that Stadium 5 still uses 35mm projectors. Holiday 6 has 4 digital projectors. Users/MaxLucas
 As of late 2011, Auditoriums 1 & 5 have switched over to digital projection. The rest of the auditoriums are slated to switch over mid 2012.

20121117 22:32:00 nbsp Really wonderful customer service. I was helping my housemate in trying to locate a lost item on an extremely busy Saturday afternoon. I called in several times and was starting to get annoyed, but on the fourth attempt, someone picked up and helped me out. I go to the theater and see a huge (like...Disneyland during the summer huge) line of people at the ticket booth and concessions...I thought it would be impossible to try to talk to someone. I spoke with the lady checking tickets; she and another employee tagteamed and one notified the manager who was busy working concessions. The manager was most agreeable and helped me out within ten minutes and I was able to get my friendd scarf back. Very customeroriented, didnt rush me at all despite how hectic everything was today. Wish more businesses were like them. Thanks :) Users/kg18

20130114 18:00:39 nbsp Is this the modern cinema, intended to compete with cable and Netflix?  If so, its not for me. If you get there on time, you are subjected to up 45 minutes of repetitive advertising and previews at earshattering volume.  Why must we PAY to be subjected to endless ads?  We should pay for an absence of Coke and candy ads.  Not possible to talk or think during this prefeature assault.  Regal must reduce this if they ever want me back. Users/rednoodler
