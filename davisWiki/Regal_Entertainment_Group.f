Regal Entertainment Group is the largest movie theater chain in the country.  It is either singlehandedly destroying the moviegoing experience or keeping theaters open in small towns and updating their equipment where they wouldnt otherwise be able to.  Thus the ever running debate over large chains applies even unto the cinema industry.

The theaters operate under the brands they were before they merged into Regal.  Although many chains have been merged in over the years, the three major chains youre likely to see are:
  Regal Cinemas
  United Artists Theatres
  Edwards Theatres

Regal First Look is a pretrailer show that is broadcast nationally and carries a series of ads and movie facts.  Part of the system is seminar and training equipment that allows any theater that is a member of the Regal Group to be rented to provide remote lectures, discussions and training.  Microsoft and other large companies sometimes use the equipment to broadcast live national technology launches and developer training seminars with national Q&A sessions.  Local groups can also rent theaters.  The price varies, but in the early 2000s was running between $450 and $800 depending on equipment and staff used.

See Movie Theaters for other theaters in Davis and the surrounding area, including locally owned and run.
