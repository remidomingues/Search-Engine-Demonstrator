Regan Hall Circle is a small campus street extending west off of California Avenue. The street ends in a traffic circle circle, which goes around an island with olive trees and grass finally connecting back with itself again.

Cruess Hall, Regan Main, and the old Cowell Student Health Center can all be found along this stretch of asphalt.
