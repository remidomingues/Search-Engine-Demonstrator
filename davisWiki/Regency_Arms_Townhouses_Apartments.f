Keep in mind though you get what you pay for: when you move in the mngmt.  does the bare min. to clean the place up, they may throw on a new coat of paint, but thats about it. The mngmt. is terrible,I never met the mangagers even though they lived there and it takes forever for them to fill a maitenance request. I think the all time record for a request was 5 months. There is an upside though: besides being cheap,its quiet and the neighbors are nice. Users/MyaBrn

20060615 15:57:26 nbsp why is it called Regency Arms Townhouses Apartments? Did we mispell something? Users/ArlenAbraham

20060615 16:15:59 nbsp I dont know what the real name really is other than Regency Arms. And as an update to my previous comment about the management, it has gotten a tiny bit better. The new managers are Cathy and George and they do their best to fill maitenance requests in a timely manner.  Users/MyaBrn

20120326 11:52:27 nbsp forget about this place! Simmons realty owns it and they are the rudest and pickiest place in Davis.   Users/rosepetal140

20130521 23:51:24 nbsp The manager now here is really really disgusting, im the resident here and just bought a used car and park near the parking area(not blocking the way) less than one day, this fucking manager called towed company and towed my car without asking any body, firstly i think my car was stolen and it paid me 300$ to get it back, never never live here for that the manager here is really really a son of bitch Users/YinliangWang

20130812 17:41:51 nbsp in response to YinliangWang  you left your car in a non parking space preventing 3 tenants from moving there cars for a period of over 24 hours. all tenants were asked if they knew whose car it was and everyone said no....so therefor with no owner found and the whole complex notified as well as 3 notices left on the vehicle to be moved or it will be towed....yes your car was towed away.
