Address(Regis Drive) runs parallel to and south of Loyola Drive. Is is the first street to the north of the Davis Cemetery cemetery so the wild turkeys can often been seen wandering from yard to yard. About halfway down the street Fig Lane connects it to Loyola again. At the eastern end the connection to Loyola is called Regis Lane.
