20100721 13:33:59 nbsp Welcome to the wiki!  Thank you for all of the great additions youve been making to the City Commissions pages.  Fantastic! Users/CovertProfessor

20100721 18:31:35 nbsp I am happy to try to help if I can, although of course since the wiki is a community effort, others may have views on how things should look.  What kind of information do you have to distribute?  Did you have any initial thoughts about the way the wiki could help? Users/CovertProfessor

20100722 09:57:16 nbsp Well, we should be able to do something!  I just created a new page City Commissions/Talk with some ideas for what we might do, seeking input from others who contribute to the wiki.  Please visit the page and add any suggestions or clarifications! Users/CovertProfessor

20100722 17:50:54 nbsp Glad to help!  Check out the changes I made to the front page and the commissions page, and my reply to you on the Talk page.  Im glad the wiki is able to help out the city like this, and I hope we get some good volunteers!  By the way, to make additional changes to the blurb on the front page, you need to edit the Featured Page.  Users/CovertProfessor

20100722 23:34:30 nbsp Great, Im glad you like it!   Users/CovertProfessor

20101119 20:13:05 nbsp Hi Rei!  I noticed that you deleted the links to the Accessibility Standards Board of Appeals, Building Board of Appeals, Unitrans Advisory Committee, and Personnel Board from the City Commissions page.  Do those commissions no longer exist?   Users/CovertProfessor

20101121 09:33:18 nbsp Hi Rei!  Yes, lets list them as former commissions  then, if anyone wonders what has happened to them, theyll know  or, maybe someone will see them and think, we should start that up again!  Its good to have the wiki document Davis history as well as current Davis. Users/CovertProfessor
  P.S.  Ah, I see that Users/Jabberwokky has already listed them as former commissions.  No grass grows under his feet!  cp
