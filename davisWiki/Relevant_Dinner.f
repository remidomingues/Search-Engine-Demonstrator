Dinner at the Dump was an annual fundraiser for Local Charities local charities sponsored by Davis Waste Removal and The Davis Enterprise. The September event was first suggested by The Davis Enterprise Davis Enterprise columnist Bob Dunning and continued for 20 years.  Each year a different charity was selected to receive proceeds. All the food (including fast food, slow food, beer, & wine) was donated by local restaurants, markets, and businesses. For a single entry donation one could wander around and choose any kind of food you want and eat however much you want.  Entertainment was provided by area musicians, and people sat around the DWR parking lot on bales of recycled paper and cardboard while enjoying the food and music.

Unfortunately, Dinner at the Dump grew too big and in 2004 it was cancelled and was replaced with a Relevant Dinner in the parking lot in front of All Things Right And Relevant.
