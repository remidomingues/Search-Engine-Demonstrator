In May 2008, two catastrophic events struck east Asia.  On May 2nd, Cyclone Nargis struck the country of wiki:wikipedia:Burma Myanmar (a.k.a. Burma), leaving potentially more than 134,000 dead.  Ten days later, a magnitude 7.9 earthquake struck wiki:wikipedia:Sichuan Sichuan province in China, leaving a current total of over 60,000 dead (as of May 24th) and an expectation that the toll may rise to over 85,000.

These disasters directly affect Davis California! In particular, many of our neighbors in the city and the university have friends and family living near the earthquakes epicenter in Sichuan, China.

 Davis, You Can Help! 


One quick way of making a donation to the relief efforts is via the Hong Kong Red Cross ( https://www.redcross.org.hk/donation/user_donation.asp?langId2 donation link)

You may also donate via Mercycorps (http://www.mercycorps.org/chinaearthquake/?source1062 donation link).  At first, Western Union Foundation was generously matching each donation dollar for dollar up to $250,000.  The $250k limit has already been reached due to the generosity of thousands of individuals like you.

Supposedly, a small 100 HK$ (~ 13 USD) will provide at least a weeks food and water supply for a single victim.

The Davis Food Coop also has Charity Coupons in amounts of 5, 10, 25, and 50 dollars.  These coupons are specific to the Myanmar cyclone and can be picked up and donated at any register.

 Funding Drive also Organized by UCDs Chinese Student and Scholar Fellowship (CSSF) 

UC Davis CSSF was quick to organize a local effort to raise funds for the relief activities (http://www.californiaaggie.com/article/779 see a Cal Aggie article).  You may see them around campus, so please donate if you can.  See the CSSF website for more information (http://www.ucdchinese.org/ link) or check their new Facebook group for latest updates: (http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid17369986009 link)

(PS: due to some experts, the chance of a big quake in northern California in the next 30 years is 99%. Please go over the Earthquake Preparedness Guides (http://www.johnmartin.com/earthquakes/EQGUIDES/EQGUI_1000.HTM link)

China

Would recommend if choosing red cross, to donate directly through the Hong Kong Red Cross or Chinese Red Cross listed and not the American Red Cross because of the red tape and time for the money to be processed and wired to the disaster zone.

For Myanmar, considering donating to groups like World Vision, Tzu Chi, or Red Cross that have their own personnel on the ground and do not necessarily have to go through the obstacles governmental bodies have to to get aid to the victim (there have been numerous reports of the military government taking UN supplies for themselves)

20080522 16:59:26 nbsp For Burma (myanmar), another excellent place to donate is to the Burmese Monks Assocation.  Not only are they literally on the ground, and cannot be readily kept out like the UN and many other relief organizations, strengthening the value of the monks in the community can have positive political influence as well.  The Myanmar dictatorship can make international groups look bad, but when an internal group provides support and caring and infrastructure that the government doesnt, they can become very influential.  (Hamas and Sadrs Mahdi Army are excellent examples of that principle used against US interests).  Donating to them should provide at least as much disaster relief for your money, with the side effect of political capital.

As for whether to trust that this group isnt a scam, the international progressive group AVAAZ supports them and handles their donations.  MoveOn.org endorsed this effort instead of setting up their own, as well.

20080527 01:36:39 nbsp Can we donate to the American Red Cross and stipulate that it go to the HK or Chinese Red Cross for overseas help (I thought this was how they did it in the past)? Or is now better to donate to the Ch and HK RCs directly? Users/stevemori
