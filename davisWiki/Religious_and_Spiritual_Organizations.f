Religious and Spiritual Organizations in Davis hold discussions, worship services and other activities. Following each section is a very brief and general statement to help visitors understand the basis of belief for each grouping. Please visit each individual page for a more specific description of each organizations views and practices.

Also please keep in mind that Davis is a small but diverse community; though we may have no West Sacramento Sikh temples or places of congregation for Rastafari, we do enjoy the diversity offered by people who follow these and other beliefs. We would encourage you to use the information on this page to borrow facilities in which you might meet to share fellowship with others who hold your beliefs  the Unitarian Universalist Church of Davis actively embraces and encourages other religions and would probably be a good starting point.

 Buddhist 
Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama, and is typically divided into two main branches: Theravada Buddhism and Mahayana Buddhism. The goal of Buddhist practice is to end the cycle of rebirth through realization of true reality and thereby achieve nirvana. Some describe wiki:wikipedia:Buddhism as a philosophy rather than a religion because it holds forth neither a single or multiple godlike beings.

 Catholic 
 There are no Eastern Rite Catholic churches in Davis, so those observing the Eastern traditions must go to Sacramento.  Roman Catholics may receive communion here, as the Byzantine Catholic churches are in full communion with Rome. Generally services (called Divine Liturgy) are in English, yet their liturgical traditions are based in traditions of the Ancient neareast.  The church liturgy is virtually indentical to corresponding Orthodox tradition, and while most are considered autonomous selfgoverning churches, they recognize the Bishop of Rome (Pope of Rome) as the head of the Universal Church.

 The Church of Christ, Scientist 

Christian Scientists believe in one, infinite God who is All and allgood. They believe that God is not distant and unknowable, but that God is allencompassing and always present, and that each individual is loved by God, cared for by Him, and made in God’s image  spiritual, not material. Christian Scientists believe in the Bible and in Christ Jesus as the Son of God, or promised Messiah. And they believe that Jesus’ teachings and healing work expressed scientific Christianity, or the application of the laws of God—laws which are still practical and provable today, by anyone, anywhere. Christian Scientists consider the Commandments, as well as Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount, to be central to their lives and practice of Christianity.

 Eastern Orthodox
http://www.orthodoxwiki.org/Orthodox_Christianity Orthodox Christianity is one of most practiced forms of Christianity in the world.  Although there are many different ethnic Orthodox in America, all practice the same religion and Traditions handed down from the Apostles nearly unabridged and unchanged.  There are no Orthodox Christian Churches in Davis, so the nearest churches for those observing the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox Traditions are in Sacramento and surrounding areas.  However, there is an Eastern Orthodox student community which meets at The Belfry (a center for campus ministry) in Davis.  It is called the Orthodox Christian Fellowship or http://davis.ocf.net/ OCF.   Fellowship starts with prayer (in English), followed by a discussion led by a priest or a guest, and a meal.

 Discordian 
Discordianism is a syncretic religion that combines respect for the Greek goddess Eris with some of the more absurd aspects of Zen Buddhism, a lightweight and less mystical version of Crowleyan Thelema, and a heaping helping of Postmodernism. The end result is a more Easternstyle philosophical religion.  The primary belief is that order and chaos are different aspects of the same thing, and that solely depends on the perspective of the human nervous system.  Their dietary restriction prohibits eating of hot dog buns, and their sacrament involves eating a hot dog on Friday.  The holy book is the http://principiadiscordia.com/ Principia Discordia, which encourages schisms and cabals in the church.

  The Campus Crusade for Chaos and Confusion is a subversive activist group, a wiki users are hereby warned to stay away from them.

 Hinduism 
In the formal sense, it is generally agreed that no Hindu temples exist in Davis. However, there are places in Davis where yoga, one of the six major philosophical schools of Hinduism, is practiced within at least somewhat of a Hindu spiritual context. Yoga means to unite or yoke the individual consciousness with cosmic consciousness. It is traditionally concerned with spiritual, mental and physical aspects. However, yoga instruction in the United States often underplays the Hindu spiritual elements in order to attract a more diverse following. Many Western students are primarily interested in the practical health and mental benefits of yoga while ignoring the spiritual, a position which is almost unthinkable in its country of origin.

Please list yoga organizations that prominently feature Hindu (as opposed to Buddhist, Jain or secular) characteristics:

  Barefoot Yoga Studio offers a Power Flow class series following the Ashtanga eight limbed yogic model based upon the ancient Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. The ultimate goal of such exercises is to attain a deepseated awareness of universal consciousness and achieve spiritual liberation. Each Power Flow class ends with a guided meditation while in the corpse pose savasana.
  Kaya Yoga teaches Anusara yoga, a Hatha school which features a ShivaShakti Tantric philosophy. Each class meeting is preceded by a meditative chant dedicated to Lord Shiva.
  Yoga Davis follows a system called TriYoga; it offers a wide variety of yoga styles from the Hatha school, and its official website claims the teachings to be kundaliniinspired. Kundalini is believed to be a sacred energy source coiled up at the base of the spine until awakened through various yogic or meditational techniques. Kundalini yoga adherents often claim that their discipline provides a particularly accelerated pathway to divine union and/or supreme bliss.

 Pagan 
There are various types of pagans, wiccans, and witches in Davis and the surrounding areas. Pagans arent Satanists, they believe the divine is present in all creation and tend to be polytheistic (worshiping multiple deities), including both masculine and feminine aspects. Pagans generally dont proselytize, although occasionally they may hold events that are open to the public.

Pagans typically worship singularly as solitary practitioners or as groups in Covens. As Davis is a college town the covens in the area tend to fluctuate. Covens generally require an interviewing and sometimes even apprenticeship before interested parties are allowed to join. Other covens are considered to be open or teaching covens and they welcome interested parties to join and learn.

Some Local Covens:
  http://rcotv.org/ Cauldron of the Valley holds seasonal rituals semiregularly and teaches classes in the http://www.reclaiming.org/ Reclaiming Tradition.
  Casadh an Gealach located in Davis proper, this coven contains licensed clergy and offers teaching and other services.

20051224 01:36:44 nbsp I think this page should be split into OnCampus organizations and those off campus like churches. Or a seperate page created altogether for on campus organizations. Users/CarlosOverstreet
  That would probably be covered by Student Organizations.

20060212 14:23:45 nbsp Should we reevaluate our definition of religion? For starters, the bike church is not really a church in the religious sense, and scientology is hotly contested right now. Many claim that its a cult, including the producers of South Park. Users/PaulAmnuaypayoat
  Bike Church and a couple other entries, definitely strike me as a silly, but it doesnt really seem necessary to define religion for the sake of this page. What would be the purpose of eliminating Scientologists? Including them is the Christian thing to do and excluding groups really serves little apparent purpose.

20060310 12:44:58 nbsp The Mormon link on the top needs to be moved out from under the Christian link. This is more than hairsplitting, as they have beliefs essential contradictory with Christianitys, can it be made its own category? Users/DannyHouk
As someone who comes from a Mormon family, I can say definitively that they are NOT Christians, although they may call themselves that. The Mormons have their own scripture which they take much more seriously than the new or old testament. ~~

 20060723 16:15:16 nbsp While Mormons may have practices that most christians deem odd or funny, I believe them to be quasichristian and not really applicable to another section. What do you all think? Users/CarlosOverstreet

 20060723 16:49:24 nbsp I think they should be put in the Christian section.  The mormon religion fits perfectly into the definition of christianity.   Users/GeorgeLewis

 20060723 17:34:14 nbsp LDS is generally lumped under Christian in the big three Judaic split.  I see no reason to defy the common categorization.  Users/JabberWokky

 20060725 23:45:44 nbsp Under the current description Christian on this page, LDS are not excluded as Christians.  Add something as basic as the Trinity to the description, and they would not fit where they are....  Oh and just for Mr. Wokky: http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/general/irishorthodoxchurch.aspx Irish Orthodox :)  Users/AntoniaTsobanoudis

 20080125 20:20:27 nbsp Mormons have a trinity but that trinity is not the Trinity of The Scriptures. The trinity within Mormonism is the doctrine that proposes there are a Father, Son and Holy Ghost who exist as three separate persons, three separate gods, and three separate natures, yet united in one purpose. Unlike historic Christianity, which teaches that there is The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit, Who is of one substance, and He is God. In other words The Father, The Son and The Holy Spirit are one God by nature. Users/JackkiCox

20060726 00:01:31 nbsp Who are the discordians and how do they differ from the AGSA? Users/CarlosOverstreet

20061005 15:33:38 nbsp How is it that Lutheran Episcopal Christian Fellowship is listed as nondenominational when their name clearly indicates a denomination? Most churches welcome people of any denomination, but that doesnt make them nondenominational. Perhaps somebody whos affiliated with this group can explain. Users/AlphaDog

20061013 09:34:00 nbsp A better question is how on earth can Lutherans who dont recognize the episcopate can join in FULL communion with the Episcopal Church. Nevertheless I agree with Alpha Dog, the group is geared toward two denominations however they welcome any one. Including nonchristians...  Users/CarlosOverstreet

20081202 13:27:29 nbsp Where was that picture of Our Lady of Guadalupe taken? It looks familiar.... Users/JoePomidor

20090703 21:12:36 nbsp Davis Christian Assembly no longer meets at 6:30pm on Saturdays. However they still meet at 10:10am on Sundays and have a midweek dinner and electives (split bible studies based on age groups) on Wednesdays. However, from time to time there are breaks in wednesday service.  Contact DCA for more info. I dont work or volunteer there, but I go there on Sundays. Users/BryceH
