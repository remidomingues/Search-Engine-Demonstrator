http://iet.ucdavis.edu IET  http://clm.ucdavis.edu Computer Lab Management allows you to print to several computer rooms from your laptop on the UC Davis Wireless Network.
Please note, http://clm.ucdavis.edu CLM is still improving the service, so give them http://wirelessprinting.ucdavis.edu/feedback.html feedback on how to improve it.

Sheets printed via Wireless Printing are counted on the same quota as normal printing within the IET computer rooms. See the http://clm.ucdavis.edu/rooms/printing/ IET Computer Room Printing Policies page for current printing rates.

Before printing using this service you must set up a printer on your laptop.  Once your laptop is configured you need to logon to the the Wireless Printing Logon page to select which room you would like to print to. Further instructions for printing are also available http://wirelessprinting.ucdavis.edu/ here.
