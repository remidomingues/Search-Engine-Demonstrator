 Personality 

Im a very cheerful fellow.  I get very excited about food.  I like to start my day off with a nice cardboard tube of timothy hay.  My favorite treats include the old standards like carrots with greens and spinach, but expand to include yogurt and Goldfish crackers when Im feeling extra special (Ill even do tricks for my favorites).  I love to run around the house, but Im not allowed on the carpet anymore because it was looking extra tasty one day...I just had to take a little nibble.
