Renaissance Community Church is a nondenomination Christian church. The word Renaissance means New Beginnings and we desire to see everyone transformed by the grace of Jesus so that is why you see Renaissance as the first R in RCC. Hearing stories, testimonies or seeing lives radically changed by Jesus is exciting and at RCC we celebrate when we see that kind of transformation. You can dress casually and relaxed to our worship services (No need to dress like the Renaissance Fair unless you want to). We provide RCC Kids church to all elementary school kids and nursery care at every worship service. Our focus as a church is Worship, Teaching, and Community and you will see different aspects of all three every Sunday. During our services we have a worship team lead the songs for the congregation, we use multimedia to communicate RCC events and we use it as a tool to help in our services, every Sunday we have one of our pastors (Tom or Curtis) or a guest share out of the bible and provide biblical teaching on the current series, and we take time each Sunday to pray as individuals or as a community. You will see our signs around town, at the Farmers Market, Community Events or you might an invite card from one of our RCC regulars but want you to know You Belong Here. If you have any questions or would like to get more info on our church just let us know tom@rccdavis.org
