English Country Dancers is a UC Davis student organizations student club that teaches dances from Elizabethan England, circa 1650.  These dances were recorded by John Playford in The Dancing Master.  Each dance is a structured set of steps to a given tune.  Dances are for 24 (or more) couples, in squares, lines, and circles.  If you know Contra Dancing, the structure of dances will look familiar to you.  The clubs motto is: If you can walk, you can dance.  In fact, every and anyone is encouraged to come and try it out!  Wear flat shoes and clothes you can move freely in.

Dance practice is currently held every Thursday from 6:30 PM until 9:00 PM in 2016 Haring Hall during the school year.  The location may change quarterly according to room availability (open floor space with moveable desks is a must!), so this page is kept updated on a quarterly basis.  Club members Learn to Dance dance at events on UC Davis campus including The Buzz and Student Activities Faire in the fall and Picnic Day in the spring. In addition, several members also dance at Renaissance Faires throughout Northern California in association with the Merrie Pryanksters.  The group is recreational, social, as well as a performing troupe. The main focus is early Playfordsourced dances, but the group occasionally branches out to incorporate elements from the Scottish, Irish, and Morris dancing traditions as well.  Beyond dancing, members participate in historical costuming and embroidery, and contemporary handcrafts such as knitting, crochet, spinning, and weaving.
