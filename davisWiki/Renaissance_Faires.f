There are several Renaissance Faires and or historical period Faires in northern California. The Merrie Pryanksters notably attend many faires as an acting or performing troupe.

 Northern California Renaissance Faire 

http://www.norcalrenfaire.org/

Once upon a time this Faire was held in Novato. The Novato location was nestled back into a wooded valley trail that gave the Faire a more authentic feel.

Then it was moved to Vacaville for several years. It was located near The Nut Tree. There wasnt the same removed from reality feel due to the proximity of the Nut Tree airport and Interstate 80. The faire at http://www.casadefruta.com/ Casa de Fruita is a lineal descendent of that Faire, but is run by different folks. It IS adjacent to State Hwy. 152, but most of the site is sufficiently buffered and achieves some distance from reality.

If youd like to go to more Renaissance Faires, have an interest in old English folk music and folk dance, and can make it to campus on Thursday evenings, you might want to check out the English Country Dancers.
