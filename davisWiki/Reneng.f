20101018 19:13:54 nbsp Hey Reneng, Welcome to the Wiki! JoePomidor had nothing to do with your comments being removed. According to the Allegre Apartments page, they deleted it: Major misunderstanding! Handled privately and comments were asked to be removed. Users/PeterBoulay

    I asked the comments to get recovered if you can. There is no issue to handle privately with them. Indeed there is no major misunderstanding.

   Renengplease give me a chance to work on this. You may want to call the apartment manager and tell them you did not want the comments removed. Users/PeterBoulay

      ok thanks, please take your time, I just want to say I do not want to call them. If I have to deal with them. Everything has to be in writting HERE. I think its fair to show on the change option what comments they removed. I guess if they own Davis wiki, they can do whatever they want then. Again I havnt visted their office and I dont think any issue is handled privately. Users/Renneng

20101018 20:02:03 nbsp I sincerely apologize for the confusion.  There was a gentleman that Jaymes spoke at length with today who had nearly identical concerns as yourself.  He came to the conclusion that his anger and frustration was hugely misdirected and that he wanted to make sure we (Allegre) should not be taking responsibility for what had happened.

As Peter even suggested, call us and ask us for explanations.  What harm could it do?  (530)7502200 for the office.  Our email is allegreapartments@gmail.com if you want to email.  To show you how dedicated and serious I am about solving this problem, I am even willing to give you my personal cell number and my personal email.  The ball is in your court if you want to make something positive of this.  Richard Atherton Users/AllegreApartments

  Hi, Richard, pleaes communicate here with me. As what one of the editor mentioned Youre doing a good job by responding to the comments, and I think it will show people that the management is responsive and tries very hard to fix problems, but deleting comments will only look bad and make people mistrust the management more â€”JoePomidor.  let me know if you have any question or comments. I am willing to modify some of my comments.Renng


Rennengyou are using the Wiki for your own personal war with the complex and its getting out of hand. They have given you multiple methods of contacting them. If you do not take advantage of the assistance they have offered, we can not allow the Wiki to be stuck in the middle of this. Please contact them off the Wiki by email or phone. Thank you. Users/PeterBoulay

 First, please identify yourself. As what I said, leave comments on my personal page. Also I only use 1 user name and the other comments are not made by me or anyone I know if the username is not mine. SO The comments for this entry overwhelmingly reflect a single or small minority of individuals. They are repeatedly posting comments that make similar points or are adding long essays that overwhelm the voice of others. Keep this in mind when reading the comments  on the Allegere apt page doesnt hold If they are doing things right at the first point, I wont even bother to waste my time here. Renng
   Hey, Rene... it wasnt Peter that posted that Overwhelmed notice.  It was me.  Peter is, just like you and me, a volunteer editor here at the wiki, trying to help improve this shared community resource.  I posted that because most of the content in the comments is back and forth between you and ... whoever it is that is responding (which stinks for you, because its a slippery thing trying to deal with people who wont stand behind their words with their name).  Its not to warn you off or anything, just to alert people who are scanning through the entry what they are reading.  Peter is correct, in that these kinds of disputes are seldom settled on the wiki, but youre also right that can be useful to put things in the public eye.  Best of luck. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, (814) 8898845

   Renengmy comment is identified. Secondif the Reneng they mention is not you, then call them and correct it. Youre making this a lot more difficult then it needs to be. Users/PeterBoulay

   Sorry, please give me some time to handle. If you can give me your number or email to contact that will be helpful.Renng

   No RenengI am sorry but me giving you my personal information wont help. I am not involved with the apartment complex. Call them at 530)7502200 or email them at allegreapartments@gmail.com as their page states. Users/PeterBoulay

20101018 22:45:23 nbsp Reneng, why not just go in to the office, talk to the management, and be done with it?  Itll be much faster and give you far better results than this extended argument on the wiki. Users/TomGarberson

  Its going to be a waste of time. I dont know if you have friends live there or not. If you read last years archive comments about Allegre, you will understand. Ironically, they said most of comments happens before 0809 transition while most of the comments seem to happen during the 0809 year. Users/Reneng

 Comments posted during 0809 do not necessarily mean the tenants lived on property during that year.  A prime example being that tenants from 0001 left comments in 06 (I believe it was 06).  Regardless, please call us.  Cat does not work here, and Jaymes is very much in the office today, as well as myself.  Come in and chat with us!  Richard (Allegre)

    You are right, this is a very nice argument. Richard. But it is more likely those comments posted there reflected opinions from tenants who lived during that year? So can you tell me why there is a massive amount of heated comments during 0809 transition. How long have Jaymes being a manager there? So you are saying Jon Barkeley management company (the previous allegre management) is the one who created all the issues? Thanks for explanationsUsers/Reneng.

   I wouldnt know whether itll be a waste of time, but do you really feel like youre getting anywhere by arguing on the Allegre wiki page?  Leaving a negative review is one thing; an extended backandforth probably wont help you get anything done, though, and it doesnt really add anything for the wiki. tg

   Reneng you have made it quite clear youd rather argue then man up and reach out to the Apartment complex to resolve the issue. You have gone from someone who appeared to possibly have valid issues to being a simple trolls troll. Im done with assisting you. I strongly recommend Reneng be banned if he decides to continue to use the Wiki as a battleground. Users/PeterBoulay

20101019 10:42:53 nbsp I will be happy to speak with you about your problems with Allegre if you call the office at (530)7502200.  Im in the office right now.  Jaymes (Allegre Management) Users/AllegreApartments

20110216 12:38:26 nbsp Please stop messing with the Allegre page.  Enough is enough. Users/TomGarberson

just want to let u know, I was  a valid allegre apartment tenant. I lived there during 0910. I think I should have the right to leave comments there. I was afraid to identify myself back that time because their manager just isnt a nice person. I am not going to waste any of my time to help them improve. When I have time I will post my old lease, their managments mathematical mistakes on deposites, and all that if its necessary.
 Like every other editor on here, youre more than welcome to add things that improve the wiki.  Leaving a comment explaining your experiences is great.  Warning folks, commending service, or recommending a place is all well and good.  Trying to turn a page about something in Davis into a page about your argument with management there is not.  The concern during your dispute previously was that any time management posted something, youd respond by trying to rip them apart.  It changes the focus of the page and doesnt actually add any information, other than that you really dont like them.  Your recent snippy comments have the same effect, albeit on a smaller scale.  You ignored outreach and tried to use the wiki to fight your personal battles, at the expense of the wiki itself.  Hence the reaction youre receiving.  Not sure if you noticed, but someone actually proposed a ban at Users/Reneng/Ban in light of your antagonism toward Allegre.
 Id also strongly recommend avoiding using the Wiki to fight your legal battles.  Having friends represent you with vague legal implications is a pretty bad idea.  If youre going to do so, though, make sure it doesnt go too far.  You really dont want to get into the realm of unlicensed practice of law, which is a crime in California.  The City of Davis has a mediation service that can help resolve landlordtenant disputes, and theres always small claims, if you do believe you have a strong case. Users/TomGarberson

I am not having any friend to represent me. I am not from U.S. so my usage of english can be confusing sometimes sorry. Few months ago, when I left messages here, we were still aruguing with Allegre. They made so many mistakes on the contract and they even gave us legal threats. Therefore I left message here to warn other people but I was afraid to identify myself since their manager wasnt really nice. I apologize for that here. Since I am out of Davis, I feel pretty safe now.

Allegre made few things up and sent us a bill after we moved out. The manager talked in a very terrible attitude to us when we were talking to him. At the end we sent them back all the legal docs we had and we were ready to go to court with them. They finally gave us a refund of deposite wihout any apology. We had to call their headquarter and we even talked to the lawyer for gsa. They truly wasted us a lot of time. Check with Allegre to see if I am saying the truth. I still keep all copies of the documents. Again I apologize for being a troll here but the way Allegre treating students is just ridiculous. No respect and no mercy until you are ready to go to court with them. Now the case is over, I guess I can come to leave my experience? Good luck folks, I am pretty sure Allegere is going to have a lot of complaints in the future. Feel free to ban me or remove my comments.
 Thanks for the added info!  Like I said, information is good.  Details are good, and this is a big help.  Again, thanks. tg

20110217 12:09:40 nbsp RenengIll be honestI dont really care about your position anymore. Now youve changed your story to be that you are representing someone when it was originally about you yet your message on my page says it is your issue with them. Your story seems to be changing to fit your needs and its toolittletoo late for me. I really wish you would call them personally and leave the Wiki completely out of your gripe with them. I speak only for myself and have no affiliation with Allegre. Good luck. Users/PeterBoulay
