20090220 01:32:20 nbsp damn, you beat me to the punch, I was gonna put up a photo of the outside and add some random info

I take it your open now? Users/StevenDaubert

20090220 08:42:46 nbsp Hey Steven, we opened on 2/14. Ill try and take an outside shot and post it soon. Thanks! Users/RenewDenim

20091104 12:57:10 nbsp Hi there. I like your shop!  I wanted to let you know that the Events page is intended for community events and not business sales events, so your last entry was deleted. However...if the store were to have a band play outside one evening, or if 25% of one days sales went toward a local nonprofit, for example, those would be appropriate. But clothing sales is not really a community event, even if wine is served.  Users/robinlaughlin

20091104 14:23:23 nbsp Hi Robin, Thanks I didnt realize that there was a difference so thank you for the clarification. The sample sale is open to the community and we are serving complimentary wines from local winery Rominger West. Its a great way to get them downtown and introduce the community to them. I would think that wine tasting
would be more of a community event?  Users/RenewDenim

20100212 06:18:00 nbsp So, other than one comment on The Posh Bagel page are you participating in the wiki? Ive noticed that people who edit under the name of their business see the wiki as free web hosting for their business and not a community resource. How do you see the wiki? Do you have another account where you edit under your real name? Do you know that there has been a discussion about advertising and how much of it a business can do on the wiki? Users/JasonAller
