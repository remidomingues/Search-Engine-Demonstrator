Recessionfriendly:
Renew Denim is a denim boutique for the new economy. Because of recessiondriven inventory imbalances, we can source premium denim overstock to bring customers the best brands for up to 4070% off their retail prices.

Green Boutique:
We also have renewed denim jeans, which are recycled jeans that have been embellished by local design students and artists as well as a gallery wall where we feature the work of local photographers. In addition to recycling jeans, we distribute Renew Denim ecobags with all denim purchases. When customers return they receive a 5% discount off of their next purchase if they reuse the bag.

We have 700 customers in our Facebook group and also use Twitter and RenewDenim.com to promote our company, products, and events.

20090220 00:09:12 nbsp So what is so nice about these pants? Do they have enough belt loops (should be at least 5)? Are they better than a new pair of Levis? All that prefaded stuff is a scam, the only way to do that is wear it and work in it. Users/NickSchmalenberger
 20090220 09:25:45 nbsp Nick, I spent 10 years working for Levi Strauss & Co. and I couldnt agree with you more; few jeans are better than a wellworn pair of Levis. That said, Id invite you to come check out our Mens denim products, we are carrying many brands that are sure to please even a denim traditionalist like yourself. Users/RenewDenim

20090301 12:29:38 nbsp Just checked this place out yesterday for the first time.  Its a fabulous little shop!  So welcoming and good looking!  Finally, a place in Davis to purchase some nice jeans!  I definitely plan on going back to do some shopping.  You can never have enough good jeans.  Seriously.  I have tons of pairs of jeans at home, but I find that I am comfortable in only 2 or 3 pairs.  At any rate, I look forward to going back to find another perfect pair of jeans. Users/CurlyGirl26

20090312 14:48:59 nbsp I went in yesterday and they staff was very welcoming and helpful. I found a great pair of jeans for an even better price then headed next door to Hans to get them tailored. Getting a pair of tailored designer denim and still paying wayyyy less than the retail price...you just cant beat that! Users/mwzhang

20090329 13:18:16 nbsp Amazing store! Cutest in Davis....actually cutest jeans outside San Francisco! And really inexpensive. Check it out! Users/poggle

20090329 17:06:10 nbsp I think Ill need to visit this place.  I really hate shopping for jeans at large retailers! Users/RyanMikulovsky

20090402 16:09:59 nbsp Hows the mens selection, and do they have shorts? Users/GarrettGallegos

2009051309 23:21:21 nbsp Went in to browse, lots of selection pointed out to me by helpful staff. I asked about Levis; was told even though they had no Levis on hand, they had a deal in the works with a Bay Area discount retailer to buy up a lot of slightly imaginatively stitched Levis and I should check back. I unlimbered my unobstrusive yet meticulous powers of observation while being pitched by an attractive and knowledgeable salesperson: many of the garments on display were already patched though new with stitches that wouldnt have looked out of place on Frankensteins creation or in a doily on the table at the Mad Hatters Tea Party. Ah, I realized, fashion has arrived in the old farm town. Once upon a time if one approached the Menswear Department in Wingers to buy some clothes of the twolegged variety the salesperson would be sure to include words like riveted pockets, durable dungarees, bib overalls and such words workingmen use in the sales pitch. The repeated component in the pitch at Renew is Hans Tailor is conveniently two doors down the rustic walkway...Inquiring minds want to know: Do the Han people stitch like chickens scratching in the farmyard?

20090709 20:39:46 nbsp Do you carry or plan to carry virgin denim jeans? Id like a hobby I could sit in. Users/Patrick.M

20090809 20:23:33 nbsp What makes this place great is the service! So glad that I dont need to go to a mall or the city for shirts or pants. I walk in say hi and the friendly staff finds just the right things that fit and look great. As a man without much skill at this myself, it makes it easy for me to look and feel great. Thanks! Users/zonepunk

20090916 09:23:58 nbsp What sizes do you carry? Users/CovertProfessor

20090916 23:23:58 nbsp Mens  size 2838 and Womens  size 23  32 Users/RenewDenim

20100916 21:41:55 nbsp I love Renew Denim, they have excellent customer service and a great selection of jeans and cute tops. When they have sales wow! Check them out, some of my favorite random designer jeans are from here and I only paid $35 for them, but remember to try on lots of different sizes because they are random fitting. Users/Barley123

20110928 21:53:37 nbsp Went here for the first time and was sooo disappointed.  Was excited to help with their fundraiser, donate jeans, and get a couple new pairs!  what a joke...  first of all their sizes are in the mens numbering system, meaning 2432 or something, which in America isnt used for women.  Hard to determine what you are.  I finally determined that their highest size was a 32 or so, equalling about a 10.  Im certainly larger than that size and was embarressed to be in there when I saw everything was 1/3 too small for me.  They had some gorgeous lace tops in the back, but once again only a 7 year old was small enough to wear it and they each cost $99, even the sheer lace covers (very little material).  Overall pretty pathetic.  great idea for a store, but terrible result.   Users/SabrinaMuerle

20111109 11:01:26 nbsp Sabrina, thank you for supporting FORCE: Facing Our Risk of Cancer Empowered and for stopping by Renew Denim. We are sorry that you werent able to find anything during your visit. The FORCE Fundraiser was a huge success and we sold a lot of jeans, therefore we ran out of stock quickly. Our store is quite small, so unfortunately we usually only have space to carry sizes 23  32 for women and 2838 for men on a regular basis. We do occasionally have larger sizes, but they are not always available. We do special order sizes 33 and 34 for customers regularly, so if there is something you need we are more than happy to help. Regarding the sizing designer denim is sold by waist size, which is the same for all major retail stores. We do have a size chart on our counter that converts sizes for customers who are unfamiliar with that type of sizing a size 32 is equivalent to a size 1214 for women. We have a facebook page www.facebook.com/renewdenim where we list arrivals and take customer requests. Please feel free to contact us if there is ever anything we can do to assist you.
