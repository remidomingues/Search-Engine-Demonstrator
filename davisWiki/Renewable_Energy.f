Renewable Energy uses natural resources including sunlight, wind, rain, tides, and the earths geothermal heat. Renewable energy technologies include: solar power, hydroelectricity, wind power, geothermal energy, biomass, and some amount of biofuels. These resources are Sustainability naturally replenished, so there is no worry for this energy to deplete any time soon, unlike fossil fuels. Additionally, renewable energy can be easier on some environments and does not pollute the earth as much.

Just because an energy source is renewable does not make it necessarily http://blogs.wsj.com/environmentalcapital/2008/01/23/morebadnewsforethanol/ good for the environment, such as hydroelectric dams. A lot of care and understanding of the impact any (even renewable) energy technology projects will have on the environment are necessary to make renewable energy technologies sustainable for all life on the planet.

According to the Sacramento Business Journal, the Sacramento region (including Davis) ranked 12th among the nations 100 largest metropolitan areas in terms of clean energy jobs, with an impressive 37,319 jobs.  As a percentage of the regions total population, that number ranks third in the nation for proportion of clean energy jobs.

So anyone know anything about renewable energy in Davis? how about the universitys studies into the matter? the solar power located north of town, the electric car dealership? Where can I go or who can I turn to in Davis to help convert my home to be renewable? what percentage of energy in Davis is renewable? What about some campus organizations? These are the questions that I wonder about this page, not to be a jerk, but I dont know that much myself, I would just like to hear more about this matter.~Users/DavidPoole

20080709 21:00:29 nbsp You may want to check with CALPIRG for info on renewable energy in CA.  Not sure about campus usage, although there has been much work on reducing energy usage on the campus for many years.  Much of the work for the development of the modern hybrid electric vehicle was performed here. Users/IDoNotExist

20080710 11:05:28 nbsp David,

There are a couple of great websites you can go to to make your home powered by geothermal energy. Try going to the  Geothermal Heat Pump Consortium(GeoExchange) (GHPC) website, http://www.geoexchange.org/ or the International Ground Source Heat Pump Association (IGSHPA)website, http://www.igshpa.okstate.edu/ in order to search by state to find contractors. I would also check out http://geothermal.org for more great links about geothermal energy. Im a bit biased on the subject, since I am the library associate for GRC, but geothermal is gaining steam and is a great green energy source. I am not an expert on geothermal, but I can suggest going to the University level geothermal information on the Contacts & Links page.

Good luck! Users/doggies9
