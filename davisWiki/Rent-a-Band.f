RentaBand for the Holidays was an idea suggested in the 1980s by Users/BevSykes because every year the Davis Senior High School high school Madrigal Choir offered to go to private homes to sing, as a fundraiser.  Sykes daughter at that time was playing in the school band and suggested that the band do the same thing.

Small groups of band members are available to perform for events from November 29 through December 21, 2007, with the proceeds going to support the Davis Senior High School DHS band program.  If youre planning a holiday party for your home or business, make it truly special with a live musical performance by Davis High School Band students.  Wind and brass quartets and piano soloists are available for events.  Donating a performance makes a wonderful gift for a nursing home or a nonprofit organization.
