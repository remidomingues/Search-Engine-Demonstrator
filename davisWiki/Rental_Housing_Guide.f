Renting a house or apartments apartment is an alternative to home ownership due to financial or time constraints.  Obviously most students moving out of the dorms are likely looking to rent their residence.

Residential rental vacancy rates in Davis are typically below the 5 percent generally considered healthy for a city. The result has been escalating prices and an imbalance of power in favor of landlords. A http://www.news.ucdavis.edu/search/news_detail.lasso?id8756 2008 survey by UC Davis reported the apartment vacancy rate to be 0.8 percent for 2008.  In the http://www.news.ucdavis.edu/search/news_detail.lasso?id9343 2009 survey vacancies increased to 3.2%, and they bumped up another two tenths to 3.4% according to the http://news.ucdavis.edu/search/news_detail.lasso?id9701 2010 survey.

 Benefits of living in Davis 

 Average Rental Prices 
The Davis Apartment Vacancy and Rental Rate Survey is conducted annually by the Student Housing UCD Student Housing Department since 1975.  You may read the http://www.housing.ucdavis.edu/_pdownloads/2011_vacancy_report.pdf 2011,http://www.news.ucdavis.edu/search/news_detail.lasso?id9343 2009 and http://www.news.ucdavis.edu/search/news_detail.lasso?id8756 2008 survey press releases.

The following are the 2008 average rent rates for unfurnished apartments.  2009 average rates still need to be compiled from the 2009 rent survey.

 Families 
Because so many apartments in Davis are studentfocused, it can be tough for parents to find good, familyfriendly rentals.  The University runs two student family housing complexes: Orchard Park and Solano Park.  Many of the apartment complexes farther away from the university have slightly lower student densities.  You can ask the management when youre checking a place out to get a sense of the number of families there.  Do you know of familyfriendly apartments in town?  Start a list here!

 Living with Others 
See Roommate Guide. If youre a student and getting ready to leave the residence halls, consider whether you want to live with housemates, roommates or by yourself. If you choose to live with housemates, start by figuring out how many people you can bear to live with, whether you want to live in a singlesex environment, and what the group dynamics might be. If you choose to live by yourself, start figuring out if you can actually afford to live by yourself (and not have roommates to split the bills).

 House, Apartment, or Room? 
Living in a House versus an Apartment
  Living in a house can be great because you have a nice noise buffer zone, but youll also have to worry about yard maintenance if it isnt included in your rent.
  You may not have cable/DSL in a house, while most apartments offer both as well as laundry facilities.
  Many apartment complexes also offer amenities such as a pool/spa, community room, weight room.
  Living in private homes with live in landlords has its benefits, but sometimes the negatives outweigh the positives. Live in landlords usually have washer and dryers, include all bills in the rent so you can accurately budget, etc. However, they tend to be anal about who comes over, what time you come home, how much electricity is used, etc. because they have a vested interest in the property. (Note: I would not choose this option again in the future. Its almost like having parents again, and you dont have the same power since you arent equally responsible for the place, like when you share a lease equally with another roommate.)

Renting a House/Apartment versus a Room

Essentially, if you choose to rent an entire house or apartment rather than renting a room in an existing household, you get to choose who you want to live with. But this option also takes more coordination because you have to first figure out who youre compatible with and get everybody on board, then figure out what everybody wants out of a place to live e.g. apartment or house, location, satellite or cable, etc.. Once you find some places, youll have to get everybody coordinated to be able to look at the place, or one person can do the initial looksee and trim it down for the others to check out later.

Choosing to rent a room in an existing household can be far easier on the front end, but you may find yourself working harder to fit into a group with previously established relationships and ways of doing things. If things arent going well, this can become a problem and you can potentially find yourself oddman out. Another plus to renting a room within a house is that youll probably only have to furnish your own room... this can be a minus if you already have a lot of furniture that you want to keep, though.

If youre considering living in a Cooperative Housing cooperative household, the interview process can be fairly indepth, because these are typically more mature individuals who have had plenty of bad roommate experiences. At some coops, you may be expected to meet all members of the household so you all have an opportunity to assess the potential fit. Other coops have an open membership process, where you can sign up on a firstcome/firstserve basis. In any case, it is usually a good idea to attend dinner or go for a coop tour; that way youll learn a lot about the rules and ways of the household before moving in. Be prepared to ask lots of questions and potentially answer lots of questions about your willingness to participate in coop living.

 Short Term v. Annual Leases 
  Most rental units in Davis require you to sign an annual lease that runs SeptemberSeptember. With this type of agreement, expect your upfront costs to include first and last months rent as well as cleaning and/or security deposits. Ask your landlord for the http://chl.ucdavis.edu/forms.cfm Davis Model Lease or the MonthtoMonth Rental Agreement approved by the City / UCD Student Liaison Commission; both of these documents were drafted to protect the interests of both renter and landlord.
  Some landlords/property managers may offer monthtomonth leases, but these are rare. Typically, these types of agreements are available only for privately owned/managed homes as opposed to something managed by a property company or an apartment complex. Again, expect your upfront costs to include first and last months rent as well as cleaning and/or security deposits. These types of leases can be terminated by either party with a thirtyday notice. However, if you rent a unit for more than one year under a monthmonth agreement, you must then give (and be given) sixty days notice.

 Searching for Housing 
Since housing in Davis is so heavily impacted by the university and its academic year schedule, some people start looking for housing around November/December for the following fall, and property management companies generally start releasing new listings after March, when theyre reasonably able to query current tenants on future plans. Ownermanaged properties and cooperative housing seem to hit the market a bit later  April through summer. (Look at results of the http://www.dateline.ucdavis.edu/dl_detail.lasso?id8088 current vacancy survey conducted by Student Housing to get an idea of what the rental housing market is like.)

 Organizing Your Search 
 1. Find out if youre eligible for lowincome housing, utilities, cable, etc. It may take awhile to get approved, so make these calls early!
 1. Use index cards to write down potential houses/apartments, contact info, & things you want/need, e.g.  (upstairs v. downstairs unit, dishwasher, washer/dryer, pets, etc. Use one card per location and include as much info as possible on the front; use the back for additional notes when you check out the place.
 1. Talk to friends who have lived in Davis and redline the crappy places; keep these notes so youll remember which places to avoid like the plague.
 1. With your cards on the table, start calling each place, run down your list of requirements, note the price, availability, and attitude of the person answering the phone. Schedule appointments as you go.
 1. When you look at a place, take notes on your index card and pick up any floor plan brochures available at each apartment complex  dont assume youll remember the details of each place later.

  Property Managers 
 Be very wary of property managers, who typically take a portion of the rent in exchange for finding tenants and taking care of any tenant problems/repairs. Make sure to read the lease they have you sign if its not the http://chl.ucdavis.edu/forms.cfm Davis Model Lease. (See Property Management for all management groups, and check out Slum Lords for places with bad reputations)

  Housing Standards 
   Be sure to rent from a place that meets excellent housing standards, and to avoid those that do not.

 Apartment Movein Condition 
   You can document the condition of your apartment upon moving in at the Apartment Move In Condition page.

 Searching for Tenants 

 Creating an ad 
Take the time to provide some information in your listing to make it easier on buyers.  Give your name and phone number (and list appropriate times to call you)  most buyers would rather call directly than send an email and wait for you to call them back.  Provide information about the place  if you just put up a 10second ad on Craigslist begging people to email you without giving any hints about the place, many will simply gloss over or make a mental note to check back later and never do.

Always give the address or at least general location of the place right in the ad, and if it is an apartment complex then be sure to name which one it is.  This is perhaps the most important step, as many buyers will research the place themselves if they see an ad for a room available.

Post or provide links to pictures of the place, especially of the floor plan. You can usually find these images for apartments online by looking at the places website.

Make sure you give your gender, and whether or not you are open to living coed or need a specific sex.

Consider things from the buyers perspective. Give them stuff they want to know right upfront. Tell them if they get their own room, and if theres an option for them to share it with one of their friends (or one of your current roommates, or another roommate). Tell them a bit about yourself and what they might expect when they live with you  if youre upfront about how youre a quiet recluse or sociable partyfriendly person then youre much more likely to find a good match for a roommate.

 Places to post ads 
  Let the wiki know on the Roommates Wanted entry.
  Post flyers around Campus campus on bulletin boards. Good bulletin boards are: outside the Davis Food Coop, inside Cafe Roma, and others. If you have tearoff tags, be sure to put your contact information and a brief summary of the place on the tag  people tend to tear off about 10 postings at once and jam them all into their pocket, so jogging their memory helps. If you post during the summer, remember that most summer session classes are in Olson Hall Olson.
  Craigslist  Free to post, and you can provide as much information as you want.  For optimal success, remove your post at the end of each day and repost it anew.  This will bump you to the top  many people only look at listings from within the past two days.  Make sure you put Davis or something more specific in the specific location field, as your listing will appear next to ads. for places in Sacramento.

You must however, have a Reddit account and have a certain amount of karma (Reddit point system) to post.

Remember, you can post your ad as many places you want  go nuts.  As a courtesy, however, remember to take them down once you fill the place  itll also save you from unneeded phone calls in the morning.

 Setting a price 
Make yourself familiar with what other people are charging.  Browse ads yourself for a bit to eye the competition.  In general, the sooner school is about to start the lower prices get, since quite a few people get desperate and have empty rooms.  Two people sharing a room tend to pay slightly more than a person taking the room for himself, so you may want to list two prices, the own room price and the sharing price.  Short term leases generally go for significantly more per month than yearly ones, although the difference is less dramatic in high demand places that sell like hotcakes where the risk of being unable to fill the place is lower.

 Leveraging Your Money 

  Affordable Housing Program 
 The City of Davis acknowledges that there are many persons of low, moderate or fixed incomes who wish to live in Davis, but find it difficult to enter the Davis housing market. The City of Davis has addressed this issue through its http://www.city.davis.ca.us/housing/affordable/info.cfm Affordable Housing Program.
  1. To qualify for rental assistance, you must first find out where you stand in relation to http://www.hcd.ca.gov/hpd/hrc/rep/state/inc2k7.pdf State Income Limits for Yolo County. Apartment complexes participating in this program have established limits within which prospective tenants must fall in order to be eligible for affordable housing, e.g. 40% below the state median income.
  1. Review the citys list of http://www.city.davis.ca.us/housing/affordable/list.cfm participating landlords to view specific eligibility requirements once youve established your income in relation to state income limits. Contact those landlords/complexes in which you may be interested to have your name placed on a waiting list for the next available affordable housing unit. You can also search for local apartment complexes that accept Section 8 Vouchers from the US Dept. of Housing & Urban Development http://www.hud.gov/apps/section8/ website.
  1. Enroll in the Yolo County Section 8 Rental Assistance Program. The county distributes federal vouchers that supply lowincome individuals with financial assistance to pay rent each month. There is usually a long wait for this program. For more information, call the Yolo County Housing Authority (800)6629656.
  1. Look at the housing cooperatives in Davis which are some of the most affordable housing apartments in town. Many were built under the citys affordable housing program and some accept Section 8 vouchers. http://www.community.coop/davis

  Saving on Utilities 
 http://www.pge.com/ Pacific Gas & Electric, our local energy provider, offers two financial assistance programs that may interest student tenants in particular. Both of these programs have subcategory programs for tenants metered/billed by a landlord versus customers with their own accounts. Because PG&E references the latter subcategory as applicable to, singlefamily customers, its not clear whether PG&E requires all household members to be related. Please note that PG&E offers other programs for households such as nonprofit living groups, in addition to savings for both homeowners and tenants on the purchase of energysaving appliances, home improvements, and even lighting products.
  The CARE program (California Alternate Rates for Energy) is a discount program for http://www.pge.com/res/financial_assistance/care/eligibility/index.html lowincome households and housing facilities. CARE provides a 20 percent discount on monthly bills. http://www.pge.com/res/financial_assistance/care/ CARE applications and additional information are available on the PG&E website.
  The FERA program (Family Electric Rate Assistance) is a rate reduction program for large households of three or more people with http://www.pge.com/res/financial_assistance/fera/eligibility/index.html low to middleincome. FERA allows you to save on your electric bill by charging Tier 2 rates (101%130% of baseline) for Tier 3 usage (131%200% of baseline). Baseline is the maximum energy usage that can be billed at the lowest price for a particular rate schedule, e.g. residential rate schedule; the baseline varies by season, climate zone and your heat source. http://www.pge.com/res/financial_assistance/fera/ FERA applications and additional information are available on the PG&E website.

  Smart Management 
  An average twobedroom apartment may cost about the same as a really nice onebedroom apartment, allowing you the option to either use the second room as a study space or sublease it during difficult times.
  If youre able to pick up a cheap summer sublet, there may be an option to pick up the lease in September
  If youre searching midquarter, people may be desperate to get out of leases, so rent and deposit can be negotiated
  Depending upon the rental market, some complexes and property management/listing sites such as http://rent.com/ Rent.com may offer limited specials.

 Housing Disputes 
The California Department of Consumer Affairs puts out a comprehensive http://www.dca.ca.gov/publications/landlordbook/index.shtml guide about residential tenants and landlords rights and responsibilities. See also Tenant Rights and Renter Small Claims Stories.

 Communication and mediation should always be your first course of action in any business dispute. This is looked upon very favorably by courts and other agencies... it indicates your maturity and ability to come to peaceful resolution on your own. The City of Davis operates a Community Mediation Service (530) 7575623 which provides a free, informal and confidential forum for the resolution of a wide variety of disputes and problems including neighborhood difficulties, tenant/landlord disputes, customer/merchant issues and roommate and coworker conflicts. The Better Business Bureau may also be able to help mediate business disputes before problems escalate, and landlords may be sufficiently concerned about their BBB rating to address issues in this arena.

 If you have attempted resolution and still wish to lodge a formal complaint, contact our local Fair Housing Commission 530/7575623 and the California Department of Fair Employment & Housing 800/2333212. Even minor complaints should be documented  while justice may not be immediate, future tenants with problems can point to your complaints as a history of misconduct. Keep in mind that this is essentially legal action, and complainants should be prepared to follow through with the case should it be referred to the District Attorneys office. Based upon anecdotal evidence some believe that students are routinely discriminated against, but no official cases were filed between 20032005; if you have a legitimate complaint, filing your grievance may validate this claim.

  Gender Discrimination 
 It is illegal for a landlord or property manager to treat a woman less favorably in the rental or sale of housing, or to require that she submit to sexual comments or actions in order to maintain her residency.(6) (Gov. Code, § 12955(d); Brown v. Smith (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 767.) A landlord, or property manager maybe liable for sexually harassing a tenant. (Civ. Code, §§ 51.9 and 52; see also,Brown v. Smith, supra.) The Womens Center advocates for womens rights and may be able to provide specific assistance to those who believe themselves to have suffered gender discrimination.

 Renewing Your Lease 
  Some time before the end of your rental period, you will be asked to sign a lease renewal.  You also may choose not to sign a renewal, or declare that you do not intend to renew your lease.  Landlords prefer to get a signed renewal as early as possible, because it reduces their chances of having an unfilled apartment, and because it reduces their marketing time and expenses.  Some landlords will put pressure on residents to renew by stating that their apartment will go on the market for other potential residents if they do not commit to an early lease renewal (often as early as January or February.)  In reality, unless a tenant has been problematic, most landlords would probably prefer if the current resident stays in their apartment rather than finding a new resident, since that minimizes the landlords marketing, and apartment turnover costs.  Residents benefit from committing to a lease renewal as late as possible, because it leaves them more time to find a new apartment if their old one proves not to meet their needs during their lease term (issues that affect your decision to stay may come up throughout the year.)  Residents also benefit from renewing later in the rental period because once they have signed a lease for the next year, the landlord has much less incentive to be responsive, since the residents are then committed to staying in the same apartment.  It is to your advantage not to commit to renewing your lease until you are absolutely sure that you want to stay in your current apartment.

 Issues that may arise while you are a resident 
  Mold Mold may be present in your apartment, or may grow due to excessive moisture (such as from leaks or improper ventilation. This presents a health risk, and must be addressed immediately.

  Noise Ordinance Noise, such as that from neighbors or from sources within your apartment, may present an issue depending on volume, frequency, and your sensitivity to it.

 Survey of Renter Issues 
The City of Davis CityUCDStudent Liaison Commission, Associated Students of UC Davis and Tandem Properties conducted a http://www.cityofdavis.org/renters survey of renter issues in Davis.   Tandem Properties donated a random drawing prize of 1Insignia 42 1080p LCD HDTV.  You can read the results http://cityofdavis.org/meetings/councilpackets/20091006/02%20&%2003%20Oeste%20Manor%20Neighborhood%20Association%20Proposed%20ORD.pdf here.


 Moving Out 

 Getting your security deposit back 
The California Department of Consumer Affairs offers a http://www.dca.ca.gov/publications/landlordbook/catenant.pdf brochure that thoroughly outlines state law regarding security deposit refunds and those issues that most frequently become a problem. Please consult the Security Deposit Survey to hear how other wiki users dealt with getting their security deposit, and remember to:
  1. Document  keep your records and take clear, welllit photos of the premises prior to moving in and before moving out. Use the movein photos as reference for how well you need to clean when you move out. Give the landlord copies of the photos or do something else as proof you took those pictures upon movein rather than at a later time. If you need something done during your tenancy, be sure to send your request in writing and keep a copy for yourself... paper trails are the only type documentation sure to hold up in court.
  1. Prepare  most landlords are happy to perform repairs during your tenure in the apartment. Get things repaired early, so that they wont become an issue near moving time.
  1. Clean  tenants are legally entitled to a preinspection within two weeks of relinquishing tenancy; at this time the landlord must give you an itemized list of things to clean/repair.
  1. Be persistent, courteous, and professional

 Change of address 
  1. Change it with https://moversguide.usps.com/ USPS  do this Post Office in person if you use an address other than your Davis residence for credit card statements. To verify your information, you enter your CC(?) number and it checks to see if the billing address syncs with the old or new address you try to put the forward on. Be aware the Postal Service sells your new information to marketers and will likely increase your junk mail.
  1. Change it with UC Davis through SISWEB.
  1. Contact credit card companies, banks, etc.

 Time your move 
  1. Make arrangements for a moving vehicle, e.g. UHaul, friends truck, etc.
  1. Reserve a self storage storage unit if necessary
  1. Check to see if your landlord offers any earlymoveout incentives (some do!).
  1. If youre moving your own stuff between August 30 and September 1, then youre not taking advantage of all the Moving Day free stuff others are giving away. Come on! Get with it! You want free stuff, dont you!?
