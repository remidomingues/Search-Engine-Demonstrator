In order to help the Wiki Community deal with users who only leave one comment, only negative comment or only positive comments we need to have some mechanisms in place.

Pages like Bistro 33 and Davis Family Dentistry have been hit by users who have made no other positive contribution to the wiki.

I like the system that Puzzle Pirates uses; new users names are colored green until theyve spent enough time at which point they progress to another color.

Another possibility is to have another include macro that lets people know that the page has edits from sockpuppets, one hit wonders and negative nellies.

Another possibility is to have a macro that can be added after a users name at the end of their comment that has a threshold. Until a certain number of edits are made, or some other status change the macro displays a message like {{{Reputation(Users/Mary, <2,This user has only made one edit)}}}

Users/JabberWokky has started tagging suspicious comments with:  {{{}}}(This review is the {{{Wiki Community/Reputation only edit}}} this user account has made on the wiki.  While it does not invalidate this review, please keep this in mind){{{}}}.  Since that links here, a overview as to why we are concerned might be a good idea to open this entry.  People new to the wiki or internet communities in general probably dont realize the nature of single shot account abuse or sockpuppetting.

20070608 11:44:28 nbsp I like the idea of a macro for just a few posts/edits to identify the people who are only one hit wonders.  It would be best if this macro was unable to be subtracted except by an admingnome, though if they reach some introductory threashold maybe it changes to a welcome new member sort of message.  Another task for the admingnomes would be to review these periodically to see if they are also negative nellies.   Users/RocksandDirt  In addition I appologise for taking 4 edits to put in the comment box, slow brain time i guess.

20070608 13:09:03 nbsp another thing to take into account is negative comments made from legit users, IE Acadian. The owners literally hate the wiki because of the percieved anon format. Users/StevenDaubert

20070608 16:36:49 nbsp Bah. You shouldnt have to devote time to working on a wiki to leave a review.  Why is it surprising that people who post on either apartment pages, or restaurants, make no other edits?  Because to the vast majority of people, especially students in Davis, they use Davis Wiki as another resource, just like RatemyProfessor, Yelp, ApartmentRatings, etc.  They go where should we eat? Check the wiki.  Is that placegood?  Oh crap, it stunk, Imma make a comment.  The way these pages are set up, and how theyve always represented in the wiki is as reviews.  People post good/bad.  Theyre not here to look up Mrak Hall, or find out more about a park bench and who its dedicated to. People see DavisWiki as a resource, period.  And just like in those other rating/review websites, people are more likely to leave a negative comment, or a very good comment if they were impressed.  Theres very few I liked it here. It was good, fair type comments on those pages, and we see the same thing here Just not the same kind of resource you see it as. I think expecting them to contribute and somehow join in is sily, and not realistic.  Sorry mate. Users/EdWins

20070608 18:22:05 nbsp Im not so sure the issue is so much people only posting single comments and not editing as much as it ispotentiallya business or organization trying to pad their stats. If Im reading this correctly, the problem raised with Davis Dental was that three new accountstwo logged in from the same computerseparately posted glowing reviews of a place where previous experiences were poor at best. This might not be so big a deal with pages where dozens of comments have been made (both negative and positive), but three fake good reviews would balance three authentic bad ones in a way no one would really think twice about. . . and not everyone would bother checking the sources to see how reliable they might be.

The idea of color coding (or other indicator) would at least give the casual readers (read: me) a small headsup to take a given comment with a grain of salt, and we can decide for ourselves afterwards. Users/KevinChin
 In a way, this is already built in user signatures are dashed (dead links) if a user page doesnt exist. Im less inclined to trust a review of a user who hasnt created a page yet. Users/CraigBrozinsky
  Very true, but part of the problem with the Davis Family Dentistry page was that a user made a decision to leave the dentist based on a mix of reviews that included one hit wonders and users with pages. They then told the dentist that this was the reason that they were leaving and then there were some new one hit wonders leaving glowing reviews. There are also a lot of low content user pages, and some userpages get created to ask questions about reviews that dont make sense, like second floors of one story restaurants, or drivethrus for places that dont have them.

20100121 22:37:03 nbsp I think its time to revisit this.  I like the color system suggested above  something automated that doesnt require editors to go around tagging comments. Users/CovertProfessor

20100121 22:52:50 nbsp http://stackoverflow.com/ and other sites that use their system have a really good way of dealing with establishing reputation. Unfortunately it doesnt map over to the wiki really closely and leaves a lot of questions about how such a thing would be handled here. Even if there were a macro or system it still wouldnt be a magic solution that would suddenly prevent problems. In the end the most workable solution may still be a human one of having a large number of editors all applying common sense on a case by case basis. Users/JasonAller
  Well, Im not familiar with the code so I cant speak to implementation.  If you say it isnt doable then Ill take your word for it.  But looking at some of the comments on the BW page (one of which I just deleted), I see other onehitwonders that look suspicious  lets just say from both sides of the aisle.  As I think youll agree, after youve been after this for awhile a lot of things look suspicious, and youve been at it for longer than I have.  The truth is, though, that customers can gush about a business, and it can be their only edit.  (Same goes for bashing comments).  So, its hard to judge the onehitwonders.  But if they were color coded, then at least everyone who reads them could see for themselves that the editor has made only a small number of edits, and interpret that as they saw fit.  We still need the judgment of many editors, but it would help a bit with some of the unclear cases.   Users/CovertProfessor

20100121 23:06:47 nbsp LOL I was just looking at this page half an hour ago and thinking about how good an idea it was.  In theory, anyway :)  Unfortunate that it isnt all that practical. Users/TomGarberson
