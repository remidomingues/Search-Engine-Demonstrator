ResNet is the name of the campus network service which supplies internet access and basic cable television service to people living in the student housing facilities such as the Dorms, The Colleges at La Rue The Colleges, Orchard Park, Solano Park, and Primero Grove

The service within the dorms can be very slow because some people are constantly downloading music, movies and other content that takes up all (or most) of the bandwidth available.

For about an hour the evening before the last day of finals in Winter 06, much of Cuarto was without internet except for sites in the ucdavis.edu domain, sending countless freshmen into a panic.

It seems that there was a major routing issue.  Traceroutes to UCDavis were dieing in the first few hops from all majort ISPs I tested from. Users/RyanCastellucci

I was on the outside trying to get in to .ucdavis.com domains, as was a friend of mine at Russell Park.  Weird stuff, that.  According to http://status.ucdavis.edu: {{{

20080723 18:17:04 nbsp Is the cable television provided by Resnet:
1) Analog
2) Digital, but unencrypted (Clear QAM)
3) Digital, and encrypted?

Does it require a cable box?  Can you use your own tuner? Users/IDoNotExist
 The cable system is standard NTSC broadcast. Users/WilliamLewis wl

20080723 21:35:01 nbsp What happens to the signal from HD broadcast or cable feeds?  Starting in February, there wont be any more nonHD broadcast feeds, and at least some of the channels carried by resnet are normally broadcast in HD.  Are there any plans to upgrade the network? Users/IDoNotExist
   No, the switchover is not to HDTV, it is to a digital format (unlike todays HDTV and NTSC analog format).  The new ATSC broadcast standard can be either HD or SD.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20080724 14:07:44 nbsp So are high resolution digital broadcasts downsampled to SD resolution for redistribution on resnet? Users/IDoNotExist
 The networks that carry HD content create their own rescaled feed for SD viewing. They usually like to control how the differing aspect ratios (4:3 vs 16:9) are worked out, among other things. Users/WilliamLewis wl
 To add to Williams comment: Digital television (the Feb 2009 switchover) is not a change to HD and has nothing to do with HDTV.  It is a analog to digital switchover for both standard definition and high definition.  The new digital format supports both, just as the current analog format supports both.  The switchover does not really have anything to do with HD versus SD (although it does affect some other side things like closed captioning and side video and audio channels  including adding a slot for a new video format that is even lower resolution than current SDTV).
