 What is preferential parking? 
Preferential Parking parking districts (PPD) are located throughout the Davis City.  Vehicles may not park in most parking districts without a valid parking permit.  Free timed parking is available in some parking districts, in which vehicles with valid parking permits are exempt from the timed parking restrictions.

Permit parking in Davis comes in three flavors:

1. Residential: allows residents to park onstreet in a preferential parking district.

2. Commuter: allows Downtown employees to park all day without time limits in designated on and offstreet parking areas.

3. Other Permits: (see below)

4th / G St Parking Structure: monthly parking permits are available for $40 per month.  Contact Central Parking Systems at (916) 4411074 for additional information.  (Price is subject to change without notice.)

Campus Parking Permits UC Davis: student, faculty, staff, and visitor parking permits are available.  Visit http://taps.ucdavis.edu/ Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) or call (530) 7528277 for additional information.

Amtrak & Yolo County Parking Lots: parking permits are avilable only to Amtrak travellers and qualified employees, respectively.

 Why is there a need for preferential parking? 
Some university faculty, students and staff must drive to Campus campus because they live too far away to bike.  Others just drive because theyre too lazy to bike, or because they live downtown and use their car for work. Whatever the reason, the result is a major parking problem along the residential streets near campus.  This problem exists to some degree in other areas of our Davis Fair City as well.  The solution has been to impose a residential parking permit program. Permits expire September 30th of each year and are issued by the Davis Police Department.

It should be noted that many of the neighborhood associations near campus have struggled to make the permit programs fair to both residents and commuters.  A major problem for the residents, however, is that many of them do not have off street parking.  If they go to the grocery store, for example, they may come back home and find that they have to drive around for a half hour to repark.  I (Users/CarlMcCabe cm) know of one neighborhood leader near campus who negotiated with the city for months to try to keep a fraction of his block open to students and another fair fraction restricted to residents (see N permit, above).  Save the residents a headache and ride your bike (if possible, of course).
