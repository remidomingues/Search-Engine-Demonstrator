20060827 14:54:24 nbsp If FoxNews opened a salon, this would be it. Users/ChristopherMckenzie

20070703 12:14:28 nbsp if you go here, you might get a good haircut, but you might not... and the gamble isnt worth the conversation you have to endure. Users/joel

20071113 12:06:22 nbsp I went and visited this last Saturday. Fast and cocky is definitely an apt description but I sure did get a sharp haircut. Remember, this is a barber shop and true to the form (complete with the old school vibe). Theyve got my biz. Users/ChrisRodgers

20071226 12:01:10 nbsp Too cocky?  Cmon they are cutting hair not building a rocket.  Good conversation, funny banter between the two with obvious dislike for each other at times.  Great haircuts over and over.  This place is priced well, great service and is consistent.  Also the conversation you have to endure?  I have been going here for 15 years and never once had you had to endure a conversation that you didnt want to participate in.  This is a barber shop, not a salon.  My haircut takes about 7 minutes so Im just having a hard time with the enduring the banter comment.

These guys are solid Users/loneshark

20080206 10:28:03 nbsp I only go here to get my hair cut. Roger is the best ( he is the one farthest away from the door).  They are very nice and good at what they do.  This place is a barber shop and not a salon, I think the people who had negative things to say were wanting something different.  I dont want someone to spend an hour on my hair, I want it cut fast and GOOD and that is what Roger does. Users/DagonJones

20080417 12:30:36 nbsp Saturday morning, walk in.

Roger: The Usual?
Me: Yeah, regular on top but how bout tighter on the sides?
R: We can always go tighter on the sides

(10 to 12 minutes later) Everything looks great, I walk out satisfied like usual.
(1 week later) A friend says Chris, you look like Morrissey today I smile big and am undone.

Those Resler boys did it again! Users/ChrisRodgers

20080427 11:43:51 nbsp I agree with loneshark: these guys are solid.  Nothing fancy, but who needs fancy in a basic monthly mens haircut? I dont know how their prices compare to Supercuts, but their haircuts are reliably good, and its not worth paying less for an unreliable haircut. Users/AaronRosenberg

20080513 23:25:47 nbsp First visit today  fast, straightforward cut, great results, great price.  Good barber shop and Ill be back again.  I still dont get the cocky comments here...maybe their sense of humor?  Seemed fine to me.  They razzed me about how much hair they had to cut...but only after I joked about it first.  The only conversation we had was the usual talk about the weather, but Im not good at small talk and they didnt push it. Users/DukeMcAdow

20081211 17:01:13 nbsp i cant believe it took me until two days before graduation to get my hair cut here. it was the fastest, friendliest, and best cut ive had in davis. oh, the number of bad haircuts that could have been avoided these past years. im stickin with the resler brothers. Users/BenScheeline

20090316 22:30:46 nbsp Best haircut I have found in town. I tried two or three other places before I finally found this place. I go early in the morning with my 5 year old boy and were in and out.  Users/DanielBoxwell

20091009 19:07:26 nbsp I chose this barber shop solely on the DavisWiki comments. My first visit was this morning, and I was quite pleased. I got a speedy and quality haircut. Ill be going back. Users/MattHalverson

20100214 19:22:44 nbsp Would Not Go Back.  Too fast/cocky is true; the barber did not listen to my requests and did not do what I wanted. Made some random comments about minorities that I found offensive. Users/DaveG

20100303 14:32:11 nbsp I went here for the first time today as John from University Haircutters retired. Now I was in there for 15 minutes, got a great haircut and had a great, friendly conversation with Roger. Whoever says the haircuts are too fast (which they should be fast) and too cocky (whatever that means) or comments from Mckenzie I think are idiots. Great chatting, fast cuts, very social guys, old school, and most of all cheap. I HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone who liked University Haircutters and John. If want someone to waste an hour on your hair then go find a salon... this is a barber shop. Users/DP2010

20100303 16:36:20 nbsp I think there have been a lot comments with very different experiences from here.  The two guys that work here are brothers and have different personalities and styles.  I personally recommend Roger, he is a real nice guy who cuts great hair. Users/DagonJones

20100314 21:20:09 nbsp Ive never had a problem here. Ive gone in for a haircut twice, and it was fast, the wait was short, and the haircut was cheap. I heard one comment about this president in the two times Ive gone, so Im not sure how fair the comparison to FoxNews is. Users/micseydel

20100427 16:40:26 nbsp Got my haircut here a few months back, I have long hair for a guy and asked for a less than an inch trim, 15 minutes later I hear him say I took off an inch and a half (probably more, actually).  It was way too short and I could barely bring myself to go outside without a hat on for 2 weeks after. If youre going for a typical haircut (short hair, military style, etc), this place is probably fine.  But if your hair is a little more complex or styled, I recommend going someplace else.   Users/Darkfallin

20100919 11:53:19 nbsp I dont have a lot to work with but when I want a comfortable buzz and some friendly banter I visit here. Great little shop with very good prices. Users/WesP

20110102 17:03:01 nbsp Best place in Davis for a haircut, bar none. Users/marrio91

20110217 18:28:08 nbsp These guys are great, giving great haircuts every time. Users/JamesB

20120406 10:58:03 nbsp Chose this place after having visited several local barbers.  My son and I both got a fast, fresh, and clean haircut.  The brothers were amazing!  We will be coming back.   Users/FernandoJoseCruz

20140517 14:16:43 nbsp They seem to be closed, have they relocated? Users/micseydel
