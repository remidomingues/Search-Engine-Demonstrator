Restaurant reviews from the Users/CovertProfessor.


 American/Californian 

  Bistro 33
 If you like overpriced soso food served by surly/vanishing waitstaff in an atmosphere that is trying too hard, this is your place.  Oh, and dont think your dog is sitting with you on that nice patio, either.

  Cafe Bernardo
 I like the cafe (counter service) side better than the restaurant (wait service) side.  The entrées on the restaurant side just seem uninspired to me.  But the cafe side makes a nice breakfast (good toast!) and is a little less claustrophobic.  There are better places to get dessert, however (e.g., Ciocolat or Little Prague).

  Crepeville
 The Davis Wiki used to have this restaurant classified as French, but that seemed a bit of a stretch.  Other than the crepe, its hardly French... anyway, I love the make your own crepe option here.  I start with the basic crepe (cheddar and onion, I believe) and then add: eggplant, spinach, tomato sauce, mushrooms, and artichokes.  (Id love it if this were a regular menu item so I didnt have to ask for all those items!).  All dishes seem to come with homefried potatoes, something that I generally like, but these Im not crazy about.  You can substitute a salad, but you have to pay extra.  They do, however, give you a full salad, so its not totally out of line.  I like the fuji salad with the slices of fuji apples and walnuts in it.  If you have the crepe I described, plus the salad  boy, youve really consumed a lot of veggies for the day!  Its a lot of food, period, so its nice that takehome boxes are conveniently located by the counter.

 Once I tried the eggplant sandwich, with pesto on it (memory may be hazy here).  It was greasy, but good.  The burgers are good, too.  They come with cheese, sauteed onions and mushrooms, mayo, and avocado by default.  Again, you can substitute a salad for the potatoes.

  Farmers Kitchen Cafe
 The condescending attitude expressed by the owner on the Davis wiki page almost turned me away from this place, but luckily (for me) I decided to give them a try anyway.  I have yet to have a bad meal here.  Everything I have tried (salad, tamales, rice and veggies, chicken and potatoes, soup, etc.) has been fresh and flavorful.  I should emphasize the flavorful  food is nicely spiced, so that even an ordinary dish like chicken and potatoes tastes like something special.  So, come here if you believe in the mission of the place, but come here even if you just want a good meal.  But definitely dont come here unless youve got time to spare; in general, it wont be a quick meal.  Think of it as a nice place to have a long chat with friends and have a nice, healthy, tasty meal.

  Plutos
 The first time I tried to go here I walked in and walked out  it was a hot day and the menu just seemed overwhelming.  I did take a menu to go, and studied it, so I could be ready for the next time.  Most people seem to get salads here  we tried the tritip as a meal (get it with the BBQ sauce) and the turkey (its nice to be able to get real turkey when its not Thanksgiving).  Both were quite good, although the portions of the tritip were small.  We also tried the sides  there were a couple of nice vegetable sides, although the grilled one was a bit better.  The stuffing (for the turkey, of course) was really good.  Once we had a knockyouonyourass lemon bar; sadly, the next time it only teetered us a bit.

  Seasons
 Weve had one really good entrée there, and one soso entrée. The steak (hold the foie gras butter — ick!) was excellent, and it came with potatoes au gratin and a vegetable (broccoli, I think). But the breaded and baked chicken my partner ordered was boring. (There was some kind of sauce on it, but again: boring). There was a yummy chocolate dessert — I dont remember the details, but it was one of these chocolate w/chocolate and more chocolate desserts — and it was very good. The summer atmosphere seemed a lot more laidback and comfortable than the crowded winter scene I remember. Service was attentive. Its a bit upscale from most Davis restaurants, but not super fancy, which is fine with me.  Salads tend to be good; the patio is nice, but its not dogfriendly.  :(

  Tucos Wine Market and Cafe Tucos
 We had a very nice meal here, and true to their word, they were dogfriendly, which is nice to find in an upscale restaurant.  :)  Since they change their menu so often, theres probably no point in commenting on specific dishes, so Ill just say that we enjoyed the mix of flavors and the creative menu that tempts you to order too much because so much looks interesting.  The location next to the train can be a bit loud at times, although it bothered my partner and my dog more than it bothered me.

 Burgers/Dogs 

Other good places to get burgers include Crepeville and Ali Baba.

  Burgers and Brew
 Ive had some good burgers and other stuff (fries, shakes, beer, etc) here, but for some reason I just cant get excited about it.  I guess I find everything good but not amazingknockyoursocksoff.  The crowds can be daunting, so you have to choose your time to go there carefully if you dont want a long wait.  Service is usually pretty good but sometimes flakes out.  Takeout is usually pretty reliable.

  The Hotdogger
 I dont even like hot dogs very much, but I like everything about this place.  I like that I can get an all beef dog.  I like that its a small holeinthewall with lots of character.  I like that I have so many mustards to choose from  the Hawaiian pineapple mustard is really good (sweet and savory).  I like the potato wedges that are baked instead of fried, and actually have some potato on them.  I might actually become a hot dog person!

  Redrum Burger
 Redrum is definitely not fast food.  It usually takes about 30 minutes to get your food.

 The joint is not particularly wellrun.  They need to get a new doorcloser, too.  I can still hear it in my sleep: SLAM

 And yet, the burgers are very good.  Optimal bun to burger ratio is achieved with the 1/2 lb burger  but thats a lot of burger.  There are lots of topping options (lots of burger options, too), but no pineapple, which is too bad.  A chocolate shake with malt rounds out the meal nicely.  The onion rings were huge and greasy  never again.

 Caribbean 

  Delta of Venus
 Wonderful laidback hippy atmosphere; nice music, even for an old fart professor.  Breakfasts (veggie omelet is outstanding), sandwiches for lunch (the tofucurry sandwich sounded weird but was deliciously sweet and tangy) and dinner (Carribean food  we tried the jerk chicken and the plum baked chicken  we especially liked the latter).  There are so many interesting things on the menu that its guaranteed well be back many times.

 Chinese 

  Davis Noodle City
 I like the kimchee that you get when you sit down, I like the small, comfortable atmosphere and the prompt, accommodating service, I like the homemade noodles that you can get with every dish instead of rice (or, if youre with two people, get both!), I like the fact that the orange beef isnt crispy fried, I like the Hunan tofu (seems similar to what other places call Ma Po tofu, soft tofu with spicy black bean sauce).  My one and only complaint is that there arent more vegetables available, which is not to say that there arent plenty of vegetarian dishes (there are).  But a vegetable mix in a tasty sauce would be a welcome addition.  The vegetable curry comes close (and its really good  in fact, Ive yet to have a bad dish here), but it is mostly potatoes and tofu.  What Im looking for is something with lots of broccoli, carrots, snow peas, etc.

  Ding How
 I really want to like this place because of all of the vegetarian entrées, but the service is like dying a slow death and a lot of the dishes are overly fried.  However, if you choose your dishes carefully and get takeout, you can avoid most of the pain.

  Golden Sun
 This has become our favorite Chinese restaurant in town.  Weve tried lots of menu items and havent found a bad one  all used good ingredients and had good flavor.  They run a little spicier than other Chinese restaurants in town, but you can ask for your dish mild if you like.

  Hometown Chinese Food
 I got some nice takeout here — following suggestions on their page, the garlic eggplant and the generals chicken. I wouldnt say it was amazing, but it was quite good. The sauces were tasty, but wed prefer white meat chicken to the dark that we were provided. And we wondered about the MSG, given the mixed comments on the entry for this restaurant, but I didnt feel the MSG coma that I usually get after consuming MSG, so I dont think they do add MSG.

  Shanghai Town
 Its hard to know what to say about this restaurant, other than its reliably good and reliably fresh.  The red bean paste pancakes are to die for.  I love their eggplant and tofu dish, too.  Their menu is more varied than most of the Chinese restaurants in town.  Basically, I dont think you can go wrong here.

  Wok of Flame
 I walk in the door, and there they are: the specials.  Asparagus with black bean sauce (choice of meat), eggplant with szechuan sauce (choice of meat)  why go any further?  (I havent managed to, myself).  The ingredients here are high quality and the sauces are tasty.  I wish it were downtown, but nothing to be done about that.  And I wish they had more tofu/veggie dishes  there is something to be done about that!  Hope they do it.

 Frozen Dessert 

  Davis Creamery at Sugar Daddies
 You can tell youre getting the real stuff here. For example, the chocolate peanut butter ice cream has chunks of peanuts in it, and the banana ice cream — a flavor I dont normally like — actually tastes like bananas. There isnt a huge supply of mixins, but they have the standard ones; dont overlook the homemade brownies off to the side. Now I just need to save up some calories for a Cow Pie (hope they bring these back!)

  Icekrimski Cafe
 The gelato here is really good, and refreshing on a hot day.  (So, refreshing just about every day??).  Try the sorbet  its intensely flavored and will knock your socks off.  (Which you dont need anyway, since its so darned hot...)

  Cultivé Frozen Yogurt
 Cultivé definitely seems like the place for people who are more serious about their yogurt, as compared to Yogurt Shack. That person isnt me, but I can see why some would prefer it.  It has more of a yogurty flavor (a bit more sour) and there is more of an emphasis on healthy toppings  but just as the Shack has a few fruit toppings, Cultivé has a few lesshealthy toppings, too (I think there were M & Ms?).  I tried the specialty pomegranate flavor (50 cents extra).  Again, I am not gaga over frozen yogurt, but it had a nice pomegranate flavor and I vastly preferred it to my partners green tea flavor, even though I usually love green tea ice cream.  I agree with others who say that the toppings are expensive  80 cents for the first topping, 40 cents for the second, regardless of the size of your cup, and the amount of toppings I received was not a lot for that price.  But the raspberries were fresh and quite good, especially considering the time of year.

  Tutti Frutti Frozen Yogurt
 If you find yourself near the Oak Tree Plaza, you might just stop in, get a tasty yogurt to eat out outside, and peoplewatch the Nugget shoppers.  Sometimes you will get serenaded with a busker.  Not a bad way to pass a half hour.

  Yolo Berry Yogurt
 It seems like the real yogurt lovers prefer Cultivé. But I am not a real yogurt lover, and I prefer Yolo Berry. I also prefer being able to include exactly the amount of yogurt I want and exactly amount the toppings I want (Cultivé used to do that for you, but it gave in and went selfserve like all of the others). Yolo Berry has lots of topping choices; more than Yogurt Shack, I think. Otherwise, Im still undecided which I prefer. One bonus in Yolo Berrys favor is that you have a much nicer place to sit outside than the Shack — hell, you have all of Central Park.

 Other Dessert 

Not to be overlooked for an inexpensive and tasty slice of cake, a cookie, or a square is the CoHo.

  The Candy House of Davis
 Most (or all?) of the truffles are made with liqueur. That might be a plus for some, but I didnt like it — although I will say some of the truffles tasted more like liqueur than others, and as there are a lot of truffles, it might be worth doing some testing... In general I have to say that I prefer http://www.sees.com/ Sees truffles. However, they did give us some free fudge, and it was really good, so I go back just for that. Try the tricolor (light chocolate, vanilla, dark chocolate) with or without coconut.

  Ciocolat
 Mousse seems to be the specialty of the house.  Its a great mousse, not too light, not too heavy, and just the right amount of sweetness and creaminess.  There are many mousse desserts here, so if you like mousse at all, this is your place.  The 24K domes are amazing  a thin layer of cake topped with chocolate mousse and coated with dark chocolate.  Cookies are also great  ginger spice with chocolate chips is a particular standout, maybe because its unusual.  The glorious array of deliciouslooking cakes demands further research.

 If you hit up their table at the Farmers Market Farmers Market, you will find a delicious fruit crumble (it looks like a small pie).  The top (the crumble) tastes like a cookie.

  Addendum: I agree with others that this place has gone downhill in a very short amount of time. Every time you go in there, the staff seems to be brand new and thus very slow at doing even the simplest tasks. Usually this is a sign of poor management or underpaid workers... cant say whether that is true in this case, but I do wonder. And often you go in to find a very limited selection of items. I hope they turn things around, because when theyre on they can make delightful desserts.

  Konditorei
 What a lovely place to have a genteel breakfast or lunch (especially on the nice covered patio outside), or skip the meal and go straight to the dessert. Its what they do best in any case, though I do like the quiche — skip the turkey sandwich. For those of you who have only had the Americanized version of a croissant or a danish, you simply have to find out a proper flaky pastry tastes like. Its a whole nother creature. But be warned that walking into this café is to be bombarded with one delicacy after another; how to choose when one thing looks better than the next? Take heart, though, one can always return, or splurge on a cake for a special event. Too bad their hours are so few and their location only really convenient for East Davisites.

  See review for Little Prague on this page, whose extensive dessert menu deserves special mention.

  Mishkas Cafe
 The baked goods here are quite yummy (hearty, tasty, downtoearth but not boring), e.g., lemon bars, morning bread, oatmealapricot cookies...

  Nugget
 Generally, I dont shop much here because of the high prices, with the exception of a few items that I cant get anywhere else.  But the bakery items are hard to resist... especially chocolate chip cookies, lemon bars, and éclairs...

  Pink Dozen
 Ive had some good doughnuts here  a jelly doughnut with lemon filling and a buttermilk doughnut.  Good flavor, not too greasy, not the best doughnuts Ive ever had but pretty darn good.  I Davis Wish List wish, though, that they made doughnuts throughout the day and stayed open into the evenings, perhaps even 24hour.

 European 

  Caffe Italia Caffé Italia
 This is an Italian restaurant.  The menu looks very promising here, with lots of choices.  But I found myself disappointed.  The greens in the dinner salad are iceberg lettuce (why do people persist in eating it?  It has no nutritional value) and I was sorry that I didnt order the dressing on the side, because the lettuce leaves were dripping with the stuff.  I thought the red sauce tasted like a jar of Ragu, which is OK if you like Ragu, but I expect better.  (Strings sauce is much better).  I will say, though, that the lasagna dessert (I dont recall the exact name, but they do refer to it as a lasagna) was really quite good  a brownie with coconut and walnuts, topped with ice cream and whipped cream, big enough for at least two people.

  de Veres Irish Pub
 Ive eaten here a few times now and enjoyed it each time. I particularly like the shepherds pie and the beef stew. The large shepherds pie is a large portion, so you can either order the large and take half home, or you can order the half size. The stew is not in a thick broth, but it has a lot of big pieces of meat and veggies in it and was very tasty, so I was happy with it. Ask for some extra brown bread and you can take care of that broth in no time. I also tried the fish and chips. It was pretty good, but I am not a big fan of battered and fried fish to begin with (I prefer breaded), so I couldnt get that excited about it, but it was better than most, it seemed to me. The little fish tacos with guacamole make for a yummy appetizer, as do the beef tacos. This place does get crowded, though — even on a Wednesday evening during winter break. Yowsa!

  Little Prague
 This is a Czech restaurant with a nice, elegantyetcomfortable interior or the option to eat outside.  The food here was on the heavy side, but it was quite tasty.  Its a good place to go if youre splurging (on calories, that is  dinner entries range from $15$20, which is more than we usually spend on dinner, but not outrageous).  My partner had the vegetarian casserole, which sounded as though it would be very good (potatoes, tomatoes, creamed spinach, and mushrooms, in an Italian spiced egg casserole—oven baked until a browned cheese crust forms), but in fact was sort of boring.  I think its like going to a fish restaurant and ordering steak  its just not going to be that good!  So, this is perhaps not the place for vegetarian food, although there is a nightly vegetarian special that I cant vouch for.  Anyway, I had the beef goulash with czech dumplings, which was just wonderfully hearty and tasty.  My friend reported the same about her beef stroganoff, although she was surprised that it came with rice rather than noodles.  The restaurant offers an amazing array of tempting desserts.  We had the chocolate éclair, which I would get again, except that will be hard when there are so many other tempting things to try...

  Osteria Fasulo
 My review of this restaurant is long overdue, and so I cannot give specifics.  Heres the impression that lingers: a relaxed meal on a lovely patio with our dog curled at our feet, slowly working our way through several courses of delectable food, followed by a stroll on the greenbelt.  Definitely a place to go for a special occasion or even just a special treat.

  Rostini Italian Kitchen
 Davis desperately needs a good Italian restaurant.  Unfortunately, this isnt it.  Several attempts have all been disappointing  even basic stuff like the pizza and spaghetti with meatballs.  Perhaps Luigis will be good.

  Symposium
 This is a Greek restaurant.  This place was hit or miss for us.  Hits: nice atmosphere (the equivalent of dressy causal, with a mural on the wall), very tasty moussaka (eggplant, beef, and bechamel sauce, layered like a lasagna), pretty good salad (had some iceberg lettuce, but also some greens and other things) with two choices of dressing, feta or vinaigrette (but it was a creamy vinaigrette, if there is such a thing), big warm rolls, reasonable if not amazing service.  Misses: spanoko tiropita, which is spinach and feta in a flaky pasty  I usually love this dish, but this was greasy and not very flavorful; dolmas, which are grape leaves stuffed with flavored rice and, in this case, some sort of meat (although I prefer veggie ones  if that was an option, I didnt know about it)  again, just not really to my liking.  Well be back for the moussaka, no doubt, and then try something else...

 Indian/Nepalese 

  Kathmandu Kitchen
 This restaurant advertises itself as Indian and Nepalese.  My partner and I had a lovely dinner here one night awhile back.  The food was very good; unfortunately, specifics have been forgotten.  As with the one other Nepalese restaurant in our experience, the difference between Indian and Nepalese is subtle, if present at all; it seems to be mainly a difference in the spices used.  Oh, but the spices!  Definitely worth trying, if you never have.  The service was slow, however; definitely the place to go if youre in the mood to linger.  Since then, I frequent the stall that the restaurant runs at the Farmers Market Farmers Market.  There is generally a vegetarian combination plate that is very good; typical for the plate would be a spinach dish, a chickpea dish, rice, naan, and pakora.

  Namaste Nepal Restaurant
 {{{sigh}}} Theres no putting it off any longer. I had to try the new Indian/Nepalese restaurant in town. And it figures. It would have to be as good as Raja or Kathmandu. The food would have to be flavorful and fresh. There would have to be a fun new naan to try with cherries and nuts in it — a dessert naan almost, good even on its own. The butter chicken would have to be as amazing as a previous poster said, with wonderful vegetarian dishes, too. And — how much am I supposed to take? They deliver, and the delivery was prompt (faster than promised) and friendly. Oh, what to do?? What to do?? tears hair out How many times a week can I eat Indian food??

  Raja Indian Cuisine
 Ive had the lunch buffet here many times and a good number of dinners, too.  Its quick.  Its convenient to campus.  The owner is very friendly and seems to want to go out of his way to make sure you are comfortable and happy.  When I first started going here, the food was soso, but it has gotten better over time and now its my favorite Indian restaurant in town.  The sauces are consistently flavorful.  Sometimes we go for dosas, too.  Yum.

 Japanese/Korean 

 Not that I think these two cuisines are the same... but with some of the Davis restaurants offering both, it seems appropriate to group them.

  Davis Oshio Cafe
 This restaurant serves Japanese and Korean food.  Most of my meals here have been very good (especially the vegetarian items), although one or two were just OK.  The miso soup isnt my favorite.  Service isnt superspeedy but its not unreasonable, either, and they are very friendly.  The outdoor patio is a nice space  theres an overhang and youre protected from the wind and the street a bit.  Overall, I like it quite a bit.

  Fuji Chef
 This is a Japanese restaurant.  Apparently, everyone goes here for the all you can eat sushi?  My partner and I went here for an ordinary meal, but was not impressed by the service (which was terrible; dishes were forgotten, and then forgotten again) or the food.  One sushi ordered was clearly premade some time ago.  The teriyaki sauce was flavorless; meat was low quality.  We are unlikely to return.

  Jusco
 This is a Japanese restaurant.  We went here for the midweek all you can eat buffet.  (Is it really a buffet if the food isnt laid out on a table??  Never mind, it was all you can eat, for around $13/person).  I had been told that this was a great place for veggie sushi; this was true.  The veggie dragon and veggie rainbow sushi were delish.  However, the wonton soup had a weird flavor and teriyaki chicken didnt have a very good sauce.  Apparently, if you want miso soup you have to go on the weekend... maybe next time.

  DOSiRAK
 This is a Korean restaurant, and a great place to get a quick (they are super fast with takeout) and healthy meal.  We particularly like the japchae and other dishes with noodles.

  Manna
 This is a Korean restaurant that also serves Japanese food.  The bimimbap in a clay pot was excellent, although next time I wouldnt bother with the beef (there wasnt much of it, and it wasnt great quality), and instead would go for the tofu.  The vegetable teryaki makes an excellent light and healthy dish:  both tofu and veggies are steamed, not fried.  Yum!

  Zen Toro
 We had a very enjoyable meal here. Portions were quite large and the atmosphere was very pleasant. We tried the spicy teriyaki beef over rice, which was a nice change over the usual teriyaki. We also had a vegetable sushi platter; some of the items we liked, and some we didnt, but it was just that some were not to our liking, not that they were prepared poorly. In fact, it was obvious that our dishes were prepared with great care. Next time, we will simply order something else! (I think we would have been better off with the Vegetarian Delight sushi, or picking our own sushi, rather than the mixed platter).

 Latin American/TexMex 

  Dos Coyotes
 Went to the North Davis location, and in short, I doubt Ill go back. First, this was one of those menus with several items slightly different from one another, and you are left to figure out how they are different. (I was looking at the burritos). Not a big deal, but annoying. Second, the place is noisy. Not (necessarily) lotsofcustomerstalking noisy, but even without many customers (as there the day I was there), there is a loud hum (some kind of fan?), plus music, plus high ceilings to echo everyones voices, trying to talk over the other noise. It just wasnt pleasant. Third, the food wasnt bad, but it was mediocre. Really, the salsas were all that I liked; I just kept adding more salsa to my burrito, and thinking, Why arent we at El Mariachi?

  El Mariachi
 Love the veggie burritos here and the wonderful array of salsas in the salsa bar.  The proprietor is very friendly, and the chips tasty.  Its my favorite place in town for a burrito.

  Taqueria Davis
 Its fun (and very tasty) to get a burrito with egg and potato in it, plus meat, rice, beans, cheese, and salsa.

  Taqueria Guadalajara
 I had heard that the Guad in South Davis had put a TV out on the patio, so I was worried that the experience would be ruined, but I was glad to find out that the volume of the TV was turned down and the usual Mexican music was playing.  My favorite dish here remains the tostada with their tasty adobada (which is beef at this restaurant).  It comes with lots of fresh, green lettuce and a bit of salsa and guac.  Its a reasonable light meal, but if Im hungrier, I can order black beans and rice on the side, which comes to quite a lot of food.  Its very pleasant hanging out there on the patio, especially with ones dog, and service is usually pretty fast.  I am not gaga over the chips, but that doesnt seem to stop me from consuming a lot of them.

  Tres Hermanas
 I went here awhile back and enjoyed myself quite a bit.  I expected small portions, given some of the comments on the page, but my dish was not at all small, in fact it was quite large.  The fajitas were really tasty, maybe the best Ive ever had.  The mole was very soso, though (is there a good place in Davis for mole?).  Waitstaff was nice, decor was nice.  Definitely a nice sit down Mexican meal experience.

 Middle Eastern 

  Ali Baba
 The specials!!  Oh, the specials!  I love the specials, especially the vegetarian one (which is available all the time) and the pomegranate w/chicken one.  They are served with rice and yogurt.  Since they are specials, they are already prepared and can be served right away, so they make a fantastic to go meal.  The specials are so good that it is hard for me to order anything else.  I tried a dolmas appetizer once, served with a tomatoey sauce.  It was OK.  I do like the hamburgers burgers quite a bit, in part because they are very generous with their mushrooms.  I dont like their kabobs or baba ganouj  go to Sams for the former and Café Méditerranée for the latter.

  Café Méditerranée
 This place is a bit tucked away, so its easy to overlook it  every time I go, I vow to go more often.  The falafel is crisp and hearty, the baba ganoush is divine, the hummus has just the right proportion of lemon to garlic. I need to explore more of the menu (one way to do that is to order five sides), but so far Ive not been disappointed.

  Sams Mediterranean
 I think this is a good place to get some nice falafel and hummus in a pita.  The chicken kabob in a pita is also very flavorful.

 Pizza 

  Lamppost Pizza
 Its Sunday, and youve got a hankerin for pizza.  But Village Bakery is closed.  Symposium is closed.  What to do??  Lamppost Pizza is a fine alternative.  While I wouldnt say it was amazing pizza, the bread was good, the sauce was good (the place where a lot of pizzas fail) and the toppings were fresh.  I eat this pizza regularly.  As a nice bonus, it is prepared quickly.  Look for the Facebook specials.

  Steves Pizza Steves
 Ive had this pizza at Picnic In The Park and I was unimpressed.  It wasnt bad (you have to work really hard to make bad pizza), but the crust was tasteless.  It tastes marginally (but only marginally) better at the restaurant.

  Symposium
 Symposium makes great pizza  theres no doubt about it.  But its a rich, dense pizza.  Sometimes Im in the mood for that, sometimes not.  When I am, it cant be beat.  (See review of other food served by Symposium under European restaurants).

  Uncle Vitos Slice of N.Y.
 Uncle Vito, I grew up with N.Y. pizza. I know N.Y Pizza. N.Y. pizza is a friend of mine. Uncle Vito, you’re no N.Y. pizza.

 The pie looked pretty, with veggie toppings fresh and nicely arranged, but it was basically flavorless.  The crust was overly floury (dusty, if you know what I mean), the cheese also had no flavor, and the sauce was only marginally better.  Even with red peppers and parmesan cheese, it was still barely edible.  There are better places to go in Davis for pizza; if you want a slice to go, head to Village Bakery.

  Village Bakery
 Lets just say that its very hard to pass anywhere in the general vicinity of this place and not stop in for a quick slice of pizza.  Love the vegetable pizza.  And now I am starting to think that I prefer the plain (cheese and sauce) pizza  sometimes, nothing hits the spot like the basic food, and VB does it really well.  Muffins, etc., are great too.  Village Pizza & Grill has the same great pizza with notsogreat service and other menu items.

  Woodstocks
 The people here seem very nice, and its great that they will deliver to campus when others wont.  But the pizza just isnt very good.  Edible in a pinch.

 Sandwiches 
Daviss sandwiches sandwich scene has been looking up lately, though it still isnt quite what it could be.

  Beach Hut Deli
 Ive tried this place a couple of times, but couldnt seem to find anything I liked.  The sandwiches are massive, but the flavors not to my liking.  Perhaps there is a magic sandwich there that I would like, but I doubt it.

  Cloud Forest Cafe
 This cute little café is a welcome addition to Daviss sandwich scene.  The grilled paninis all have nice fresh vegetables included, with a choice of ciabatta or focaccia bread.  I quite like the ciabatta, which seemed very fresh; havent tried the focaccia.  The smoothies were also quite good.  I get the feeling that this place is emphasizing quality over quantity; there arent a lot of choices, but all the choices are good.  Smart move.  One weird little annoyance  passing through the doors (even the door to the restroom) sets short beeping alarm.

  Zias Delicatessen
 Zias has become our goto place for sandwiches in Davis, rivaled only by Cloud Forest (and as variety is the spice of life, I am happy to patronize both places).  As with many places, sometimes it takes a few tries to find your favorite things.  The Zias frittata is pretty unique and worth a try if youre feeling like something different.  The Romas artichokes are a lively complement to the turkey and provolone.  Love the soft rolls.  Love that they are great about large orders (call ahead) and accepting UCD purchase orders.  The sandwiches are large and a good deal in the $5$6 range.  Still wish that they were open a little bit later in the evenings, but I am happy to see that they added some Sunday hours!

 Thai 

Ah, Thai food.  A wellmade Thai sauce is the nectar of gods.  Davis is lucky to have so many good Thai restaurants.

  Taste of Thai
 Reliably fresh and tasty.  No outdoor seating, but bonus points for being open on Christmas.

  Thai Canteen
 A reliable place to get decent Thai food, conveniently located next to Davis Creamery, with outdoor seating.

  Sophias Thai Kitchen
 This is the easiest of the Thai restaurants to fall into for lunch when youre on campus.  I almost never go here for dinner, though, in part because my partner doesnt like the peanut sauce (usually one of our favorite things).  It is a bit unusual for peanut sauce, I admit, but I kind of like it.

  Thai Nakorn
 Our favorite Thai restaurant in Davis.  Consistently and awesomely tasty.  Some of the menu options here lean more towards Chinese, so if youre not sure what you want (or if you have a mixed party that cant make up its mind), its a good choice.  I also like the choice of meat or tofu for many of the dishes, and the sauces are great..  Also gets points for the Dogs dogfriendly patio.

  Thai Recipes
 I like the way that they always ask if you want your tofu fried or soft (i.e., steamed); most places you have to remember to ask, and sometimes you get funny looks.  I used to really like the food here, and the atmosphere is nice, but lately their flavors have been very off.  With better places in town we probably wont be back soon.

 I had heard somenotverygood things about this restaurant and so avoided it. However, academics tend to get dragged to restaurants not of their own choosing, so it was only a matter of time. Well, it doesnt seem as though I was missing anything. I had a lemongrass dish and it was extremely greasy without much lemongrass flavor, plus the meat was of a poor quality. The lemongrass dishes at Sunrise Restaurant are much, much better. I guess the next time I am dragged here, which hopefully wont be anytime soon, I will try some pho, and perhaps that will be better.

  Sunrise Restaurant
 This place looks like hell from the outside.  It looks like hell from the inside.  Plates often linger on tables long after their diners have left.  And yet, the place has a nice mom and pop feel, and the food is surprisingly good.  And inexpensive.  Were back often.  Takeout works well, too.

  2k Thai Food
 This is my least favorite of Davis Thai restaurants.  Its not so bad that Id never go there, but I dislike it enough that I would never choose to go there, and would only go with someone else who for some perverse reason insisted.  The sauces are bland and flavorless.  And I find the atmosphere offputting  they seem to be trying very hard to be hip, but they fail miserably.

  Aioli Bodega Espanola
 This is a Spanish restaurant.  Two things I really enjoyed here were: the wide array of vegetarian tapas, especially some little cheesy puffs and the grilled vegetables, and the vegetable paella (which is not something that you see often).  The paella is for two, but if you go with a bunch of people you can split a bunch of tapas as well as a paella, and have a nice, varied meal.

  Fuzio
 This will sound like an odd comment, but they make a great tuna melt.  A great tuna melt is hard to find.  Most are soggy or greasy or use dark tuna or put pickles in the tuna.

  Kabul Afghan Cuisine Kabul
 I really like this Afghan restaurant quite a bit.  They have an allyoucaneat lunch buffet and regular dinners.  The atmosphere is comfortable, the waitstaff is friendly, and, most importantly, the food is delicious  it is wonderfully spiced and flavorful.

  London Fishn Chips
 Of course, this is not exactly the healthiest of meals, but the portions were quite large (each piece of fish is pretty darn big, and you get a lot of chips, aka fries for us Americans), especially for the price.  And its as good as battered fried fish can be (personally, I prefer my fried fish dipped in breadcrumbs, but what are you gonna do?  you take what you can get).  Id like it if the fish were served with lemon, although it is available.  The guy behind the counter was very friendly and helpful.

  Mirai
 This is a Japanese restaurant that also serves Korean food.  My partner and I tried the bimimbap and the beef sukiyaki.  I liked these wellenough but the CPs partner thought the beef quality was poor, and the dishes a bit greasy.  Not that I disagree with that, but I thought it was worth a second try (the flavors were good)  my partner disagrees  maybe well be back there eventually.

  Queen of Sheba
 I was really excited for this place to open, and it did not disappoint! First thing to notice is that the A/C problems that they apparently had on the second day during lunch were fixed by dinnertime. The restaurant was pleasantly cool on hot Davis evening. I did not find it cramped, either — I guess it depends on what youre used to, but I found it less cramped than, say, Burgers & Brew. I like smallish (Ive also seen smaller), intimate restaurants like this. The decor is also quite nice — good colors with interesting art on the walls. Ok, enough surroundings — the food! was delivered faster than expected (the menu warns you that it might not be fast), by a pleasant waitstaff, and it was very good. The flavors in the sauces paired with the enjeera are delightful. We particularly liked the Key Watt (a beef stew), but everything in our combo was good. I look forward to trying other items!

  Red Orchid Restaurant
 I used to like this place as much as Davis Noodle City, which is to say, I liked it quite a lot. (No surprise, since it was the same owners). Now with new ownership, its terrible; we threw half of our takeout away and never went back.  If I hear that its improved, Ill give it another shot.

  Stones Cafe & Catering Stones Café
 The food here seems very fresh and healthy, and the sandwiches are all intriguing, the sort of menu where you want to try them all (Im still working on that).  Bread can make or break a sandwich  this bread definitely falls into the make category.  Its hearty, fresh, and tasty.  Burgers are served on a sourdough roll (and I wasnt sure how Id like that  but it was good) with enough greens on the burger to make a salad (plus, of course, other options  choice of about 56 cheeses, bacons, different types of onion, etc.).  I wasnt crazy about the mix of flavors on the avocado sandwich, but thats probably just an issue of my personal taste buds.  The curried chicken sandwich was much more up my alley.  And you can get a real turkey (not pressed deli turkey) sandwich.  Woo hoo!  From comments on their wiki page, sounds like they used to have an eggplant sandwich  I wish theyd bring it back (swap out the avocado sandwich??).  Its also worth mentioning that everyone here goes out of their way to be extremely friendly and helpful; its technically counterservice, but its more like counterservice+.

  Strings Italian Cafe
 This place gets extra points for dealing gracefully with my large, somewhat disorganized group.  They have a nice, tasty marinara, which goes pretty far in my book, because its make or break for so many dishes.  The artichoke ravioli were quite good.  They need to switch to a greens salad, though  theyre still serving the oldfashioned nonutritionhere iceberg lettuce salad.

  Thai Bistro
 They have quality ingredients that taste good.  Try the sweet and sour chicken with mango.  (Heres a hint: its not that deep batter fried stuff with gloppy pink sauce).  I also like their curries.  Service has been uniformly friendly and consistent.  And they get extra points for the nice outdoor patio where you can bring your Dogs dog.

  Thai Dynamite
 Its disconcerting to eat Thai food in an American diner, but Californians should know by now not to judge a restaurant by its appearance. This was really quite a treat. They seem to put a particular emphasis on having a variety of fresh vegetables in their food, a big plus in my book. The fresh rolls had sprouts, carrots, cucumber, and avocado inside (shrimp optional) — an unusual combination, but very good — and the peanut sauce had a nice bite to it. Service was a bit slow at points, but they were extremely friendly and so it was hard to be mad. I hope this place does well. Well definitely be back to try more dishes.

  Yogurt Shack
 Ok, I have to say I dont really understand the concept behind this place (and similar places)  you get yogurt, as opposed to ice cream, because its healthier?  less fat?  And then you throw a lot of high fat candy on it?  Or do some people genuinely prefer frozen yogurt to soft serve ice cream?  But even though I cant make sense of it logically, I have to admit its downright tasty.  I tend to go for a yogurt with chocolate in it; black cherry was also good, whereas I couldnt really taste the peanut butter in the peanut butter chocolate.  As for toppings, I imagine Im pretty boring as these things go, but heath bar, brownie, oreos, and coconut make a good combo.  $3 gave me a portion that was plenty big enough (easier to achieve if you take the smaller cup  theres definitely a tendency to get more with the larger cup).  I saw people walking all over town with cups of this stuff, and so Im guessing this place will do pretty well.  Oh, and if you want to be virtuous, you can get just the yogurt alone, or yogurt with just fruit.
