People get thirsty when they sit down to eat. Some restaurants help out by putting a carafe or pitcher of water out so you dont have to wait for refills!

  Jusco
  Wok of Flame sometimes. Ask for it!
  Dennys upon request.  They also have tall juice carafes.
  Hunan upon request.
  Tucos, if you seem to be going through water fast.  If they dont drop one off, just ask.
  Sudwerk upon request


Wherever you are, just ask.  I drink a lot of water.  A lot.  We often have a running pool to see how many glasses Ill drink during dinner.  At restaurants where service is a bit slow, I typically ask for a pitcher/carafe, and I doubt there have been more than 45 places that have refused.  The vast majority of places will be happy to oblige. Users/TomGarberson
  At a Dennys in Florida I was a regular at, they (jokingly, but in half seriousness) moved one of the tall commercial iced tea dispensers to our table.  Having more experienced wait staff who can use common sense also helps.  A timid new wait person might be less inclined to do anything that isnt in the manual. jw
