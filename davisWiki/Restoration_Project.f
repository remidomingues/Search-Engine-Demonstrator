As far as adward, malware, other gook, you could also download and install, Sypbot or AdAware. Just Google these names and youll find their websites. Try these first before paying to get rid of these nasties...

Deleted by RC in edit 158.  Edit 159 was RC starting that computer ask a question page though.  Personally, no objection to this deletion (it belongs on a general computer page anyway, not specific to this business).

Summary
Lost comments from Real Computers page prior to rename.  Only two:
     Thuns small chain on cost of replacing a letter on keyboard.   Should we reinstate?
      Yes; useful information re: the repair and pricing. Users/TomGarberson
          http://daviswiki.org/Real_Computers_%26_Free_Diagnostics?actiondiff&version2252&version1251 Reinstated 2.19.10
     SolidSender recommending to use adaware.   Should we reinstate? I vote no on this one.
      I also vote no, although I do think it might be worth adding a Do It Yourself or Helpful Links section to Computer Repair with a mention of some of the antivirus and antispyware products out there (especially the free ones), among other things. tg


  Real Computers & Free Diagnostics, ~250 edits


130: JS, RC, JP, JW, ES (readding Xe)  Nothing lost.
3160:  RC, WH, Mono, Keepingitlegal, MC, CP
edits of note: keepingitlegal was more of a wiki issue.  JW integrated the info later on when Brian did get a license. Nothing lost with that exchange.

This chain regarding a failed store in Orangevale in 2002,  Responded to, later deleted/integrated as he never had such a store.  I dont think this is an issue, as its integrated into the entry under history.

Small chain removed: http://daviswiki.org/Real_Computers_%26_Free_Diagnostics?actiondiff&version289&version188
Regarding whether his business license is under RC or RC & FD.  We could reask the question, if its relevant to integration into the entry.  But we dont usually list business license info on pages.

Summary
Lost comments from Real Computers & Free Diagnostics page
     1 comment selfdeleted by WH.  No issue.
     1 comment about a store in Orangevale; irrelevant/wrong business, info integrated into entry. No issue.
     1 comment about what will your business license name be? Worthy of integration? Dont think theres anything on any business wikipage about the license name.



Overall summary by ES (revised):  There wasnt actually much, if any, deliberate foul play here (In terms of sweeping things under the rug).  The bulk of the edits were revert wars, unnecessary revert wars.  To be honest, I lost a little bit of respect for a few wiki editors  when you go through over 550 edits one by one, and watch the entire thing play out, its painful. Im not excusing Brians part at all, merely saying I expect better from the wiki community.   I seriously think over 100 edits were dedicated to adding a line about brians a bad wiki user to the entry.  Justified or not, a lot of the stuff came out pretty petty :(   Anyway, I think part of the reason this ended up being cleaner than many people thought before I went into it is because the entire ordeal was rather hectic.  The chaos played out onto various user pages and talk pages and so on, and so it seemed like an even larger task to unravel it all.  I dont think theres anything to gain by going through the talk pages and other sidepages  I had recovered both xe and Mr. Mateos comments when they were on the wrong page and transferred them over at the time they were left.   Anyway, once again, going through both page titles didnt reveal any fake comments planted or deleted for the most part. There were the few deletions as Ive pointed out above, but I think most of them actually had some rational and werent malicious.  As I said on the other talk page yesterday, the comments were unedited as well; the single comment with bold in it was left that way by the user.  To respond to JW below, Brians tendency to spin every edit piece by piece was quickly evident when you fastforward through 500+edits, but I think its been winding down. I think thats why Ive been sticking up for him a bit, although S.O. used to do similar things, I think it was SOs clear intent and attempt to purposefully manipulate that used to drive me crazy.   Brians not even close to the ideal wiki user, but I dont think hes being malicious, merely overprotective and stubborn. users/edwins ES
  Wow, impressive work.  Thanks for doing that. tg
   Definitely impressive work!  There was previous discussion about the integration of the comments you mentioned above because they were not just integrated but rather made nicer.  IE, it seemed the point of the integration was to soften the complaint.  EG, the initial complaint about a missing license was actually rather negative but the integration makes it sound all nice and warm.  There were comments on the talk page (if I recall) where people complained about this.  The general thought was that the comment should have been left in place, and the owner should have responded inline about it rather than removing it entirely. Same thing for the orangevale issue, which I think actually was responded to but deleted afterward anyway.  I removed my comment mainly because it was clear that Brian didnt want comments on his business unless he controlled the content, so I removed my nice comment (I doubt he would have had a problem with it) to avoid it being changed. WH

Nice work.  I was wondering myself how many hijinks were really going on in the comments (I knew his user entry was hell on the wiki for comments, but I didnt recall anything hideous done to the comments on the entry).  Honestly, the iffy thing I saw was a sub24 hour spin every single edit somebody made to the body of the entry.  I know that happened, because it was repeatedly done to edits I made to try and characterize and add context and specifics to the entry.  Tiny little adjective removal or addition or clause changes that slowly accumulated into a quite different writeup over time.  Its not a bad technique; its one Ive used with good intent (although I usually hit the entry all at once rather than one word every few hours).  It also can alter substantially the wording.  There was a fierce push against it for awhile, so I am not sure what the net result was over time.  jw

20100212 09:22:40 nbsp Thank you, ES. A monumental task.  Id just ask you to keep this page up for awhile  Id like to look it over, but Im not up for the task at the moment.  Feeling a bit wikied out.  Im sure it will pass. Users/CovertProfessor

20100219 10:45:12 nbsp Are you serious? We dont need this page. Everything is fine as it is. Users/RealComputers

20100219 10:49:55 nbsp When you go hiking do you throw stones at hornets nests? Are you in the habit of spitting into the wind? Users/JasonAller
  I just dont see why this is here. No one is complaining about the page so who does this serve?
   Of course you dont see why its here  you refuse to admit youve done anything wrong.  But what I see is that this page has been whitewashed... spin as jw puts it above.  You have fought every word, every change that every other editor has made, even though those editors have just as much of a right to make changes as you.  The page has suffered as a result.
