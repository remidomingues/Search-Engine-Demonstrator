Does anyone know what happens now since Measure H passed, but Measure I failed? Does that mean both failed? I dont know myself because they seemed like they were both needed together in order to work. Molnar

 They both need to pass or it fails.   Users/SteveOstrowski

 Even if both H and I passed, Sacramento torpedoed the whole thing by rejecting measure L.  Users/WilliamLewis

20061109 10:38:11 nbsp Sacramento rejected it because of a number of reasons, including the fact that an annexation of Yolo might increase prices in Sac, and (unfortunately), because of measures Q and R, the arena tax. Most voters were looking at that instead of anything else. Users/AngelaPourtabib
