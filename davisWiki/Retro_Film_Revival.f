Retro Film Revival used to be held at Regal Cinemas Davis Holiday 6 Holiday 6 on Thursdays at 10:00PM. Tickets cost $5, making it a pretty good cheap date. They have a fun atmosphere before the showing. Sometimes there is trivia contest (with prizes!) and they also toss out free candy. Unfortunately, the film schedule is not on their website, so this is THE place to see it. You can find a list of upcoming movies on Fandango under the Holiday 6 listing.
