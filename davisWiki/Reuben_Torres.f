 Candidate Statement 

Hey Aggies!

My name is Reuben Torres and I am a third year, Managerial Economics major and Spanish minor. I work at the Student Recruitment and Retention Center (SRRC) as the Administrative Director for the African Diaspora component (ACE) and I am an active member of both Mga Kapatid and the Black Student Union. I am running for ASUCD Senate with Students Matter: Activism, Retention, Teamwork (https:///www.facebook.com/UCDSMART). From my experience working with and serving students, I have learned how important it is to actively be a part of the larger Aggie community. In order to achieve real positive change in student life, it is crucial and beneficial to create solidarity across the larger student body.

EXTEND UNITRANS HOURS OF OPERATIONS DURING THE NIGHT & WEEKEND

Bad weather, stolen bikes, and pricy parking permits encourage students to use an alternative and convenient transportation resource: Unitrans. Many students need to stay on campus late in the evening as well as weekends and the current bus system limits students, who rely on Unitrans, to commute to and from campus. I will work with the Unitrans’ General Manager to connect with Transportation and Parking Services’ green energy initiatives. I believe that through advocating and supporting the connection between Unitrans and green energy initiatives, such as the “GoClub” program, we as a community will be able to extend Unitrans hours through more efficient management practices.

CAMPUS TUTORING SERVICES ON WEEKENDS

Currently, the Student Academic Success Center (SASC) provides students with tutoring only on weekdaysMonday through Friday. Students are busy: we need help and need more access to tutors. SASC’s tutoring services should be extended into the weekend, so that more students can have access to study spaces and tutoring services. An increased availability of academic tutoring services will retain UC Davis students and ensure academic success. If we are to maintain our academic excellence in higher education, we must fight to ensure that every student has the opportunity and resources to succeed. In collaboration with the Office of the Vice ChancellorStudent Affairs and the Academic Senate, I will develop an action plan for implementing the extension of these services as an ASUCD Senator. I will also connect with the Student Services & Fees Administrative Advisory Committee (SSFAAC) to lobby to extend the purview of facilities maintenance and work towards extending tutoring services.

CREATE A RETENTION RESOURCE FAIR

I will organize an Academic Probation and Subject to Dismissal (AP/SD) retention fair in order to help students placed on academic probation or subject to dismissal status. Students need more staff resources to ensure academic success and I want ASUCD to holistically support students by advocating for this fair.

Vote for informed student leaders that genuinely care about your undergraduate experience and will listen to YOUR needs, VOTE FOR ME REUBEN TORRES #1 for ASUCD Senate, S.M.A.R.T. #25 and F.U.Q. for President and Vice President!
