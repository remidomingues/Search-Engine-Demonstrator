AKA Chad Van Schoelandt.

 Chad was in Davis for a very few days this summer! 

Rev. Chad was elected to the Green Party of Yolo County County Council, and is running with other Davis College Green Party Campus Greens. He hopes to steer the local greens to focus on election issues such as Choice Voting and voter registration.

He is proud to have been http://www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2005/06/07/Opinion/Guest.Opinion.On.The.Culture.Of.Life1320835.shtml?norewrite200607290432&sourcedomainwww.californiaaggie.com published in the Aggie with a column about the relative infant mortality rates and charitable giving of the US and European nations.

Chad served as MiniTrue, the Minister of Truth at Davis in the Students for an Orwellian Society OrwellSoc.  This means that he was in charge of all of the adverinfo and agitprop that are plusproduced by the Davis branch of Big Brother supporters.  This is why he cotaught a class on propaganda through the Experimental College.

Philosophy is not only Chads major, it is also his hobby, and he is usually glad to help people with their philosophy classes or to sit around and discuss philosophical things... particularly when people buy him a drink at Starbucks. He will soon begin graduate school where he hopes to study political philosophy and go on to compete in the horrible market conditions for philosophy professorships.

Chad lives with Users/MarieHuynh. They planned to get married on January 25th, 2053, in Yosemite, assuming it is still all nice and green and not too tourist trodden. Instead, they got married in Davis Dec. 30th 2006. They may renew their vows in 2053: Its a Saturday.  Be there!

 Future Projects 
  He was accepted to the Philosophy MA program of the University of Wisconsin  Milwaukee, where he was be an Ethics TA and is currently on Fellowship.
  He is researching a number of topics, mostly related to Kant and Rawls. He may attempt to bring them together for a dissertation roughly on the topic of separating Justice and Virtue, a.k.a. the political and the personal.

 Organizations 
He was on ASUCDs Internal Affairs Commission and is now the ASUCD Elections Committee Events Coordinator.  He happened to be the Vice President of AGASA. Rumor has it that he was a member of the Elections Committee Slate.

Users/RevChad, is a cofounder of Students for an Orwellian Society, and was a senate candidate for SOSSS in Fall 2004. During the Winter he was a candidate with Friends Urging Campus Kindness and took a major role in authoring a set of election reform bills for ASUCD. One of his top projects was trying to get GASC to offer an abstinence program called Users/KenBloom Ken Bloom Teaches You How Not to Get Laid.
  Its a good thing I dont drink coffee, because Im laughing so hard it would come out my nose.  Users/KenBloom

Other political organizations he has been known to associate with include the Libertarians (both of them).

He was a proud member of both AGASA and the Christian Slate.


20050216 16:13:41 nbsp You were rather compelling at the coho forum today. I also just read an aggie style in which you claim that the Illuminatus Trilogy is your favorite book. It is mine as well. Do you ever get the feeling that there are WAY more discordians out there than you ever thought possible? Users/DanMasiel

20050219 18:28:40 nbsp I was the only discordian I knew in High School, then I met a few in Davis randomly at a showing of Red Dragon. Either way, we discordians must stick apart. Users/RevChad
