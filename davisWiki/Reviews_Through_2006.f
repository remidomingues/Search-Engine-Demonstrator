20041119 03:12:28 nbsp Easily the BEST fish tacos Ive ever had, and Ive had a lot. I bike to Winters once a week, just to have the fish tacos here. No fried fish,cabbage or white sauce to be found here. Just well seasoned fish, with good salsa, excellent corn tortillas, avocado, lettuce, and a little lime. Clearly theres more to it, but those are the highlights. My wife loves the cheese enchiladas, and is always willing to drive out to Winters for them. My Bicycling biking friends love the weekend 6 tacos for $6 deal (no fish or shrimp :) This restaurant honestly has the best food I eat each week, and the family who run the place are all quite friendly.

20050929 20:45:51 nbsp Indeed it is one of the finest places around. I have made it a habit to eat in every taqueria I pass by, so far giving my top award to Taqueria Davis in Davis, although sometimes they have bad days. Guadalajara in Woodland has some great tacos, but wiki:woodland:Quetzal, in the same shopping plaza has handmade tortillas which are out of this world. Guadalajara in Davis is okay, as is Tamale and Mariachis. My dad still makes the best tacos bar none. Users/JoseGonzalez

20051030 16:59:46 nbsp The pork adobada taco was one of the best ive eaten in California, but the fish taco wasnt as good as those at Taqueria Super Tamale or the now defunct Chicos tacos. they only offer two salsas, but both are superior to any of the nonspecialty salsas in davis. Users/CraigBrozinsky
  They actually have three different salsas. Users/VivianPham
   And a little jar of Jalapenos next to them.

20051208 17:55:10 nbsp the real deal.  this is the first positive thing I have to say about a Mexican place in Davis. Users/DudeNude

20060302 21:01:15 nbsp My wife and I went to the new Davis location recently, and Im happy to say that the food there was excellent. We both felt that it was at least as good as that at their Winters restaurant. We both had Fish tacos and I had an adobada taco. Hopefully everything else on the menu is just as good. Yay! Users/EricKlein

20060316 17:05:20 nbsp Chuys is possibly the best Mexican food I have ever had and I didnt expect to find that when I relocated 300 miles north. I will try to find a way to make the pilgrimage to Winters whenever I can. The pico de gallo is awesome and the homemade horchata is sublime. Im excited theres a location in Davis now and Ill have to try it ASAP. Hopefully its as good as the one in Winters.

UPDATE 20060404 03:20:28 nbsp Ive been to the one in Davis a few times now. The food is almost as good. Two big downsides, though, is that the tortilla chips arent serve yourself and hot like in Winters and also NO HORCHATA. The horchata was the #1 reason to go to Chuys. I talked to one of the workers about this and she said that theyll probably have a horchata machine in this summer. In the meantime, though, Ill continue to make the trek to Winters whenever possible. Users/SteveKent

20060318 20:28:06 nbsp When I went there, the cashier forgot to charge me, so I had to wait in line 10 minutes to pay my bill. Food service was exceptionally fast. Users/SteveDavison

20060318 20:42:03 nbsp Davis location: I sort of had the opposite experience as Steve did... service was pretty slow, but we went at a time when there were only two people working and a lot of customers.  Excellent food for the first time me and my flatmates went there, with quality only a little below the level of Taqueria Guadalajara.  It wasnt as spicy as we had hoped, but the cheese enchiladas were excellent.  $1.75 for a fountain soda is a bit too much, though.  All in all, its worth returning to Chuys (especially for West Davisians) and an improvement over the previous establishment. Users/BrentLaabs

20060318 21:50:28 nbsp Finally decent Mexican food in West Davis! I walked over today and tried the fish tacos.  Different than the tacos Im used to, but very excellent.  I especially liked the avocado. Nice touch. Users/JillWeinstein

20060401 07:26:09 nbsp I am happy to report that Davis now has a really good Mexican Restaurant.  We went to Chuys Taqueria on Lake Blvd. March 30th 2006.  The service was very good and friendly.  I had a taco salad with chicken which was huge.  The chicken was very tender.  My husband had carnitas which he really liked.  I have always gone to the Chuys in Winters but was happily surprised to see one just down the street.  I definitely recommend it.   Users/JenCam

20060404 13:21:55 nbsp Best place to get Mexican food in Davis. I got adobada tacos and they were the best tacos Ive ever had. They were huge too.  The cheese enchiladas were pretty damn good too Users/PattyLouieJunior
  Huge?! I love Chuys, but one of the odd bits about them is how small (and correspondingly inexpensive) the nonfish soft tacos are. Did you maybe get it with flour tortillas or something? Users/EricKlein
  I got it in corn tortillas. Maybe the tortillas were small themselves, but the three times i got them, the tacos were over  flowing with meat.

20060411 20:19:14 nbsp So after all the hype about Chuys from friends and Wiki, I went there tonight.  I ordered two fish tacos at the recommendation of the girl behind the register and a soda...grand total $7.81. For $7.81 Id expect much better quality.  First and foremost, the fish was chopped up into very small pieces to the point where it got lost in the shredded lettuce and you couldnt tell that you were eating fish. Secondly, although the tortillas were good, my tacos fell apart because they were so drenched in grease/some kind of liquid. If you ask me, fish tacos shouldnt be THAT wet. Plus, the chips were cold and broken into small pieces. The environment was clean and quiet which is nice but made me feel like I was in the library.  My friend Adams carnitas burrito was a bit on the tough side; the pork did not come apart like it should have. Overall experience: NOT THAT GREAT.  Users/KarlaFung

20060412 15:18:01 nbsp Not as good as I expected.  Id go to Guad first. Users/TiffanySnell

20060412 23:58:27 nbsp The fish tacos are fantastic! I couldnt agree more with Eric Kleins comments above; for both the Davis and Winters locations. Users/JeremyNewton

20060503 00:34:59 nbsp Interesting note: One of my friends had me try the quesadillas with chile verde the other day (not on the menu). It was phenomenal. I would highly recommend it. I still prefer the fish tacos to anything else, but this makes a good change of pace. Users/EricKlein

20060604 02:46:47 nbsp mmmm.  had an enchilada plate there recently.  The sauce was great, the kind that stains the plate red, and has a nice dry spicey taste.  I could eat here everyday! Users/DudeNude

20060828 12:08:37 nbsp They have excellent seasoned pork (Adobada) and currently have a 6 soft taco for $6 special. I dont know if thats a regular thing or not, but its good value today. I had a shrimp taco the first time I went, and it was awful; It tasted like an expired Safeway pack of bay shrimp.  The crispy tacos were made in a generic preformed hard corn shell, very disappointing. The soft tacos, however, are a big win, and come highly recommended. Users/ChrisLambertus

20061109 6:53 nbsp Everything is excellent at Chuys, but go for the seafood dishes.  Their coctel de camaron, ceviche, and camarones a la plancha are easily the best in Davis.  I especially love coctels, and the one I had at Guadalajara was inedible.  Chuys coctel has really meaty shrimp and the regular selection of fresh vegetables to go with them.  The service is gracious and nice, although they were a little slow one evening when understaffed.  Please go to this restaurant!  Its a little out of the way from the regular downtown haunts, but well worth the trip to west Davis. Users/JerryMonte

20061125 13:16:43 nbsp Great value  huge burritos.   Users/AcMach
