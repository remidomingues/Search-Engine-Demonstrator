20080111 16:31:05 nbsp This is my favorite sushi place ever! I had to move out of Davis and have not found a place that can sub in for my cravings! The Mango roll and philly roll are the best! Users/Jessica4444

20080118 15:46:48 nbsp My wife and I eat here all the time.  Its the best sushi in town in our opinion! Users/DavisMan56

20080402 13:46:12 nbsp Their chirashi was really good. My experience was pretty good with the food  it just sucks when people are waiting inside the restaurant to get seated. We had the window seat and these white people kept looking at our food and commenting on it to each other. Kinda annoying! Users/Aarolye

20080409 07:58:26 nbsp I really enjoy Moshi Moshi.  Good food, friendly service and certainly a bit small.   will agree with  Users/Aarolye that if you are stuck waiting you are a bit close to the dining room, however, I find that Im typically bothered when I feel people starring at me while Im eating regardless of their color. Why is color even relevant?   Users/loneshark

20080430 22:49:00 nbsp I tend to go to Nobu the most while in Davis...though Ive tried Mikunis in Sac, my all time favorite is Shogun Sushi in Elk Grove. Happy Roll #24! Users/michimi

20080507 19:28:11 nbsp Great flavor combinations!  My favorite roll is the Smokin Kristin. It is delicious and I can share it with my friends who refuse to eat anything that isnt fully cooked. They also make an oshinko roll just the way I like it. (I am weirdly picky about my oshinko to rice ratio.)  I feel lucky to live near Moshi Moshi.   Users/JenniferNeureuther

20080518 20:33:03 nbsp so this place, hands down would be my favorite sushi place in davis. not as expensive as Osaka, but just as good, even better. not so great service when theyre busy  obviously need more staff. tuna tarts are yummmmy! love sashimi so i always get the chirashi, and i looove the diana roll   Users/Ngooyenc

20080626 19:30:12 nbsp I love the food and I love the environment. However, I went tonight and ordered 6 basic rolls togo. They told me it would take 20 minutes (should it even take this long?) So, I left and when I came back I had to wait for 12 additional minutes without any apology. I was left to sit with no greeting until the waitress who took my order eventually told me it would be a few more minutes. There were about 3 parties of 2 when I first arrived and it was busier when we got back, but that shouldnt really effect my togo order. Also, I am pretty sure that food went out to people who arrived after me before I got my food (it looked as though it may have been from the kitchen instead of the sushi bar, though). This isnt the biggest deal ever, but it was the last straw for me. Every time I order food togo from this restaurant it takes a very long time, usually longer than their estimate. I had made up my mind not to go here again... but when I got home and ate my food it was quite fresh and tasty, so I changed my mind. I wish there was another option for good sushi that didnt cost as much as Zen Toro. maybe Ill just stick to dining at the restaurant, Ive never had a problem when Ive done that. Also  why do they only hire female employees for the front of the restaurant? Users/BlairGoss

20080627 12:09:25 nbsp delicious. ive never had to wait longer than expected for togo orders, although the rolls sometimes seem not quite as well formed as when you are eating in. the older man makes rolls the best by far. i too have wondered why they only hire girls for serving...and why they have to wear pink shirts. Users/Davisgrad13

20080627 21:30:58 nbsp I tried this place after reading the reviews, but I was disappointed. I loved the katsudon, but the sushi itself wasnt particularly good. I thought most of it was alright, but then the strangest thing happened when I ordered toro (fatty tuna). I order toro a lot, and it was the first time Ive ever seen a sushi chef soak toro in water before serving it. My friends ordered rolls, both of which were pretty average. Users/st3phi3

20080725 23:41:12 nbsp I have now tried ever sushi place in davis, except for the newest buffet down on second, and Moshi Moshi is my favorite!  I was so disappointed by the sushi I have had at other places, and had more or less lost hope of finding worthwhile sushi in Davis, until a friend brought me here.  I have already been back twice in only 3 days.   Users/Chantal

20080821 16:13:28 nbsp Rude staff, not that good for the price. Users/renee415

20080823 21:29:51 nbsp Used to be our favorite place.  Then the service steadily got slower and worse.  Now, I believe you will receive better table service in a federal prison than at Moshi Moshi.  I am fairly serious when I say that.  The last time we were there, everybodys dinner came out in the usual amount of time, accept for one person.  The waitress did not return for about 25 minutes after that.  When she finally showed up we told her that a dinner was still missing and she said they were making it at that moment.  Another 30 minutes later she comes back and says they are just about done making it.  It was rice, with fish on top of it, literally, nothing else to it.  In the mean time, while waiting, the same waitress came to the table 3 times to ask if everything was okay, each time we had to tell her that we were missing a dinner.  Oh yeah!.  On one of the visits, she asked if we would like anything else or if we would like to order dessert.  To which we replied, no we are missing a dinner.  So, the pile of rice with fish on top arrived, everyone else had been done eating for quite a while, and it was closing in on 2 hours since we had sat down.  I like the food, but it is not good enough to wait like that, and Im sorry to say, we will not ever be going back, there are other sushi restaurants in town that do not require a full nights commitment to eat at.

20080930 20:29:30 nbsp Creative rolls, but I think the place is a bit expensive. Users/feichuhuya

20081012 10:24:05 nbsp Their rolls are more unique than the regular selection in town, but its a bit pricey. Users/feichuhuya
