Users/ChrisTakemura ct still hasnt forgiven them for displacing the ramen shop, but then he also hasnt forgiven the late ramen shop for CEASING TO SERVE RAMEN.  Still glares at the place whenever he passes by.  Admits the food isnt bad, though.

20050221 14:10:41 nbsp this place is good, (i think davis has a good selection of thai restaurants compared to other cuisines like italian and chinese)...the lunch specials are a really good deal. 56 dollars depending on what type of meat.  the pad thai is really good here, along with their eggplant lovers. 2k Thai Food 2k thai food might be a little better, but its a close call. the lunch specials come with soup, egg roll, and rice.  The one thing that makes this place better than most in davis is that they give rice free with all non rice/noodle dishes, this actually makes it the cheapest thai food in davis.  And thus if you factor in price this place is probably at least even with 2k thai.Users/MattHh

20050415 15:21:29 nbsp This is my favorite Thai restaurant in Davis.  They do a wonderful paneng curry.  Have never had a wait to get a table, but theres always a good number of people there at dinner time.  The portions are such that two people who order 1 appetizer and 2 entrees will probably have enough to bring some home.  The prices are lower than Thai Bistro, but I wouldnt say the quality is any different.  Its a great place to start the dinner & a movie date, as its right next to the Signature Theatre.

20050418 20:18:10 nbsp Went there a few days ago, and was disappointed to be sure. Red curry (supposedly hot) was mild to the max(or min) and the food was soaking in corn starch. It was the only thing I tasted and made it really inedible. Users/DanielMedinaCleghorn

20050707 21:10:44 nbsp Some dishes like the hot and sour soup are only for the adventerous. But dishes like the pinapple fried rice  and stir fried veggies are unique and very yummy!  Users/SiennaGrass

20050708 08:22:05 nbsp Tried the Praram #30 once and it was so bad I couldnt even finish it. I can usually muscle my way through just about anything, but this was terrible. Just drowned in a sickly sweet peanut sauce that must have been made from Jif. Havent been back since. Oh, and I usually like Praram! Thai 2K does it well, I believe. Users/AlphaDog

20050721 16:02:36 nbsp Their red curry is the best I found in davis. Also, lunch is pretty cheap. I dont suggest the iced coffee, though. Users/JenniferEllis

20051110 23:39:15 nbsp The portions they serve tend to be on the small side, and for the prices, seem quite expensive. The food isnt outstanding either, and tends to weigh heavily on the sweet side. The soup i ordered was also a bit heavy on the coconut milk; i like coconut milk as much as the next guy, but it was a bit much. Users/MatthewTom

20051222 13:01:42 nbsp The #6 Spicy Tofu appetizer is so good that I crave it fortnightly!  I think it is the best fried tofu in Davis.  I dont know what they do to the basil leaves to make them so crispy, but they add a nice compliment to the mildly spicy sauce.  Highly recommended. Users/MattJurach
