20050817 15:01:35 nbsp If you dont like to wait, the machines upstairs arent that busy. Every time I go to the second floor I dont see a lot of people using them. Users/SimonFung

20051110 15:37:49 nbsp The ARC is the least studentfriendly place on campus, in my experience.  They dont allow outside organization to post flyers (presumably because it might mess with their image).  They used to charge student organizations to reserve rooms when it first opened.  They actually billed ASUCD Senate for holding a meeting there, because they are technically a campus department (though they are obviously a student organization too).  Lockers in the Rec Hall used to be free, but now they charge a monthly fee.  And you cant go to the ARC during the summer if you arent taking classes.  I dont know who they think they are catering to, but it certainly isnt the students who FACE Initiative paid to build the place. Users/BrentLaabs

20060318 23:19:38 nbsp I think theyve closed the old weight room in the Rec Hall.  There had been a sign saying it was closing March 11 I think. Users/BenWebber

20060403 18:52:10 nbsp This week, the Arc has a try before you buy promotion, but it only extends to faculty and staff, not alumni.  Alumni can BUY the membership, but they cant try the place  insane when you think about how it was the alumnis fees that helped pay for this building.   Users/RohiniJasavala

20060405 00:02:08 nbsp Um, wrong Rphini, I am an alum and they let me in today. Get your facts straight. Users/DavisLurker

20060409 05:40:50 nbsp The Arc is a great place to go work out and have fun.  I really want to point out something to the current students and those who are going to go to school here in the summer and fall 06:  The weigh room is full of posers, just like The city of Davis.  Guys: some dont know Richard about working out but coming in with a fface like im cool, look at me.  Girls: please dont put make up on?  please dont show off your Laffy Taffy.  Guys wont get a boner because your workout pants.  One more thing, if you are coming in with a bitchy attitude, please go see a DR.  People dont give a crap if you are big or a lot of meat, people would think that you are an oily meathead.  Please dont show off your muscles in front of the ladies, they probably wont think about it after they got off that machine.  Oh, more to add.  Please dont enjoy yourself in front of the mirror more than 3 seconds, we know you love yourself so much.   Users/DingLiu

20060503 11:22:09 nbsp Although Im not as bitter as Ding about the ARCers, I do think its really funny to see the dudes trying to do themselves in the mirror after each set.  And you forgot to mention those girls who take a machine for 1 hour because theyre reading a Nicholas Sparks novel and moving at the pace of an arthritic 90 year old woman.  Plus the weight room always smells like feet and bad cologne. Nevertheless, I love the ARC! Users/JonathanVillavert

20060602 01:24:57 nbsp Well, if you are that bitter about the general ARCusing population, Id suggest coming to the rock wall there. Weve our own niche of people separate from that of the bros and the girls there... Users/PaulArden

20060712 23:40:54 nbsp I would like the mysteries of the towel shortages explained.  They also could use a neck machine.  If you dont go during the busy times, its pretty easy to get in a good workout.  The pickup basketball can be hitormiss.  Usually theres either too many or not enough people.  Playing basketball with undergrads brings out the worst in me anyway, so Im probably better off. Users/MisterProfessor

20060722 20:15:14 nbsp The summer hours fucking suck  Users/MikeAhmadi

20060809 03:34:58 nbsp is there really a starbucks in the arc? Users/JoeRunnels

20061018 23:20:20 nbsp There is a coffee shop in the ARC, to the left as you walk in I think. The ARC is a nice place, oftentimes packed. It is best you go in with a plan if your going to use the weight room. No what you want to do so you dont kind of walk aimlessley around while waiting for 23 different spots to open up. Staff is friendly and helpful and overall people are courteous and easy to talk to. A great place if your serious about being healthy, staying in shape, or getting that killer body you always wanted. Users/FrankYoung

20061018 23:20:59 nbsp know what you want to do > Correction concerning earlier post.  Users/FrankYoung

20061208 19:02:46 nbsp The pickup basketball games are good but people are big time babies.  I come from a city where there is no such thing as foul and people at the Arc call it very often.  The irony is that the people that call foul are typically taller and bigger...other than that I love the arc. Users/GregWebb
