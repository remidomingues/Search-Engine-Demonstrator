20080702 02:08:22 nbsp I work right next to these apartments, and while I agree its not quite an urban ghetto, it is as ghetto as Davis gets. An abnormally large percentage of regular problem customers at my work live in this place. My car was broken into while parked across the street from Anderson Place, and the cop I made the report with flat out told me he was positive someone from the complex was responsible. Cops are always outside the place looking for people and there are lots of mentally disabled people walking around halfdressed and/or talking to people who arent there. Its not Compton or anything, but it aint El Macero either.  Users/JakeJames

20081031 08:51:33 nbsp They are trying to improve the complex by having a new manager come in and she changed the policy on everyone even the ones who lived there for years.  Make sure you leave the apartment spotless before leaving or theyll charge you hundreds of dollars for a little bit of spot cleaning.  Also, make sure that when you move in you pay attention to every little detail and note it  or they will charge you for repairs even if you didnt do it.  The managers before were much better than the new one. Users/Marcie
