20061010 10:11:43 nbsp I have never had the Pizza guys in Davis, but I have had the one in Woodland multiple times.  It is pretty bland pizza  the crust tends to be spongy, and the overall flavor just isnt there.  It is definitely edible, but it is far from great.  In this case, you get what you pay for.

20061010 10:33:12 nbsp Try white garlic sauce + artichoke + chicken. Reaaal tasty. Users/TheodoreSuryapurnama

20070121 16:33:48 nbsp The people who answer the phones sound Shadiness Factor pretty shady. Users/CarlosOverstreet

20070131 23:58:12 nbsp You get what you pay for. That said its decent pizza for a tight budget. Garlic/Cheese bread is actually really good. Users/TusharRawat

20070304 13:42:40 nbsp I agree with CarlosOverstreet  the people who answer the phone sound pretty shady. Plus, it took way over an hour for my pizza delivery AND my pizza was a total disappointment. I ordered a Firework or whatever the crap its called  and there were about 5 Italian sausage chunks on the whole thing. Sucked. Users/CourageCowardlyDog

20070601 12:40:31 nbsp Calzones give you great bang for your buck, but are greasy as heck.     btw all the cool people call this place PIZZA KIDS (because the young age of most of the workers), you should too. Users/KyleLanderhoffis

20070601 12:55:34 nbsp Pizza Guys is awesome.  On a busy party night you cant be too disappointed that your pizza gets there late, but Ive never had a pizza I didnt like.  Also nice is the bonus twoliter you get when you pick up your order.  A lot of the guys speak Russian.  Oh, and Entertainment Book has a twoforone coupon, which lets you get two of pizza (any size any number of toppings) for the price of one.  Also Super Saver Card is a good deal. Users/JaimeRaba

20071028 23:12:33 nbsp I recommend their white garlic sauce; their garlic cheesy bread is wonderful! They are definitely a good deal when it comes to pizza, but brace yourself against their thin substanceless ranch. I recommend chopping up some fresh garlic and adding it into their dipping sauce to make it better. Go in for the soda too! Users/AnnaF

20071112 19:54:52 nbsp I have been ordering from them since I moved to Davis in 2005 because they used to have amazing pizza. Crunchy crust, fresh tasting and hot upon delivery. As of late they have completely declined in service and product. Their phone mannerisms are seriously lacking. No sense of professionalism or politeness. Very bland personalities. No please or thank yous, no may I or shall I. And I should expect them to care about the pizza Im ordering???! Yeah....The pizza arrives cold and parts of the order are missing. Order a salad, forgot the dressing. Order a pizza, forgot the soda, OR bring the wrong kind. Yes they have deals but they only have deals because their pizza and service SUCKS! If the product is quality, people will pay for it at regular price. Trust me, would think twice about ordering from them if their prices were comparable to Round Tables. Giving away free sodas may save you a couple of dollars, but I prefer quality over quantity any day. They rate at 2 out 5. Ive ordered at least 10 if not more times from them and it never improves. What a waste of time and space. Users/NasMo

20071125 14:26:04 nbsp Good cheap pizza.  Ive never had it delivered, so I cant talk about that, I do takeout.  Im not sure how much longer theyll be around, they close early sometimes because theres no business. Users/WilliamBeamish
