20070315 17:23:00 nbsp I must agree that the weight room has quite a lot of posers yet all gyms have them. There are different types of people in a gym: Those who are posers, those who go for the social gathering, etc. You should not let it get to you and just do your thing. Many are entering the weight room for the first time and do not understand how to exercise. The ARC overall is a decent gym (wished there was a pool) if you just want to get in shape.

20070427 17:59:33 nbsp It is the best gym in Davis for sure. Users/ZoeyJW

20070603 21:11:36 nbsp The classes are so fun! I love Zumba! Users/MarjaMorgan

20070701 22:57:20 nbsp The weight room has to be one of the craziest weight rooms i have ever been in. For a room drenched in the smell of sweat and feet, it sure is jam packed with gangs of 90 lb asian kids trying to bench the bar and giggling. This is the only thing that annoys me, that since their memberships are paid for in tuition, any skinny nerd can come in and spend an hour misusing a machine so that i have to wait for them to finish. I felt so much better when i was back in my hometown gym. Users/fredchen

20070707 14:03:39 nbsp So youre saying skinny people dont have the right to go work out and at least try? Wow what an asshole man. If you had balls you would give some of your workout wisdom to this guy/guys instead of bitching about it. And it does suck that the price is in tuition for people that dont want to use it it or dont go because they are intimidated by people like you. Users/HowardLuong

20070807 18:31:50 nbsp Apparently people at the ARC arent too friendly with skinny nerds, but what about ladies in the weight room? Are there many girls who use the weight room, and do they get treated well? Users/NicoleWoodyard
       There arent a whole lot of women in the weight area, but Ive never had or seen a problem. Mild surprise is about the extent of it... Users/LizPhillips

       the nerds come and go. but when theyre here, theyre usually sitting and talking on benches and machines instead of using them.

       and ladies, lift heavy. dont be a pink dumbbell cardio bunny  Users/FredChen

20070821 23:21:31 nbsp anyone know where they have rowing machines open for public use? Users/xander
       There are two or three in the back right corner of the main fitness room, between the wall and the elliptical trainers.   Users/JaneGreene

20070906 15:37:52 nbsp Im a grad student transferring to Davis from Univ. of Washington. Just wondering if the ARC has ergometers (real Concept 2 rowing machines). I just need to know if Im going to need to buy one before I get down there this Fall.  Users/Patrick

20071118 01:17:03 nbsp Nothing is more irritating than going into the gym, and having all the machines taken up by people who have so little weight on the bar/machine that they gain essentially no health benefits from the exercise.  Pretty bad. Users/sososharp
        Everyone has to start somewhere. Better to use the gym than not, right? Users/LizPhillips

          i just wish the new years resolutions groups would get out already. its infuriating when you need to a do a few sets on the bench and theyre sittin on BOTH the bench and the machine next to it in a tight circle, talking. TALKING. you cant even get through. gotta walk around the other machines  Users/FredChen
