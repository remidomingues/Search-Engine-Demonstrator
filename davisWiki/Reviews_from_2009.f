20090108 21:39:44 nbsp Mmmmm, one of my absolute favorite restaurants.  Its super clean, staff is so friendly, dishes are not only delicious but consistently so, and the place is just cozy(especially on a cold winter day, or on the outside patio in summer.  Love Thai Nakorn and will not be happy if it ever leaves (although I really dont see how it could.) Users/dgirl

20090119 14:08:35 nbsp The service here is really good.  I had the pad thai, and it definitely tasted better and more authentic than that at Sophias.  My boyfriend had the pineapple fried rice and said it wasnt too flavorful.  I suppose it was overall okay, but definitely a place to try. Users/renee415

20090325 19:23:45 nbsp The green curry here is pretty good. I mainly enjoy their Dry curry. YUM YUM!!! Ive also tried the duck curry. It had good flavor but too much fruit in it. Users/Kehaar

20090415 11:51:34 nbsp Best Authentic Thai Restaurant in Davis!!
Hands Down.
I got this account just to give them a review.
They are relatively small, and do not have lots of experience with a packed place (happens on Saturday and Friday nights). I recommend take out, not because there service is bad, but because you can skip the wait.
Its reasonably priced and the people who own it are really nice.
One time I went there for take out, right as they were closing for lunch and they gave me the rest of there egg rolls for the day.I found them with my huge portioned meal once I got home. They came with the sauce and everything.
I love this place and HIGHLY recommend it. Users/LotsofThoughts

20090504 16:32:46 nbsp Really good Thai food. I love their special pineapple fried rice, the best Ive eaten so far. Users/thtly

20090506 16:49:13 nbsp After reading the reviews here, I decided to bike over to Thai Nakorn today for lunch and was not disappointed. I got there around 12:15 and it was quiet. The lady was courteous, seated me, took my order, and brought my foodall in a timely manner. Ive only tried one other Thai restaurant (KetMoRee) and was disappointedbut Thai Nakorn was the complete opposite. I always have red curry with chicken wherever I go, and when my dish arrived, I could tell just by the look and the smell of it that it was going to be delicious. And it was! Good price and authentic taste! I may try out the other Thai restaurants Davis has to offer, but Im already very pleased with this one. Users/kg18

20090507 09:46:45 nbsp Thai Nakorn has been our favorite Thai place in Davis ever since it opened. The owner and the servers are both very friendly. We have eaten at all Thai restaurants in town and have found this one to be the most authentic and consistent with the quality of food. We have been there so often that of course we have had days when the food wasnt so great, went to another Thai restaurant and realized that not so great was better than the others. We are vegetarian and our favorite dishes are the soup, Tom Yam, the salad, Som Tam, Panang curry and the spicy eggplant. We includes my 8 and 2 year old daughters who eat as heartily as us when we visit here. Users/shruti

20090508 22:18:06 nbsp Tofu Appetizer is delicious.  I love their Pad Thai and Pad Kee Mow.  Our favorite is the Roast Duck curry.  The owner is really friendly and their price is decent.  The lunch menu is great, love the eggroll.  For two people we spent less than $30 for an appetizer and two dishes.  Im not a fan of their Thai Iced Tea but their food is great. Users/BeeBooBee

20090509 02:48:37 nbsp I love Thai Nakorn its still my favorite Thai restaurant in Davis. (See my earlier comment above.) Last time we picked up an order to go, the food just wasnt as good as it usually is. (Barely any tofu in the curry & very salty, but they were very busy that night.) Tonight when I went in, I mentioned my last visit, & I asked them to please make sure we get enough tofu this time. The owner came over, apologized & offered to buy one of the dishes for me this time. I thanked her for her generous offer, but told her I wanted to pay for my meal. She then gave me my Thai tea on the house. Wonderfully warm customer service that made me feel that they truly care about the food they are serving. I will be a loyal customer for as long as we are in Davis! Users/AprilAries

20090509 23:56:40 nbsp I ate here tonight (the second time ever and in seven days), bringing my mother along so she could try out Thai food for the first time. I came here for lunch for the first time; but at night, I really like the dim lighting. Not crowdedfood was delicious (we both had panang curry w/ chicken and calimari appetizer). My thai iced tea was good. Faa was very warm, especially to my mother who was very new to Thai cuisineshe alone just made my experience and my mothers first experience at Thai Nakorn so much more enjoyable. Users/kg18

20090609 20:16:10 nbsp Excellent food. I started coming here after 2k is now KetMoRee.... and prices are higher. I can only speak for the panang curry but it was delicious in so many ways. Perfect spiciness too, not too much but still there. I have tried Thai Nakorn, 2k Thai, Sophias, and Thai Bistro. So far, Id say Thai Nakorn wins them all (then Thai Bstro next best, 2k and Sophias) Users/Lala

20090622 21:36:37 nbsp WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!!  Ive been to this restaurant before and I was pleased with its good service and food.  I decided to come to this place after my graduation ceremony.  Big mistake!  The restaurant was not super busy (it was past 2 pm), and yet, my family and friends had to sit outside when the sky looked like it was about to rain.  After we were seated, our waitress did not show up to take our orders for a good 20 minutes.  When I finally went in and asked for menus, the waitress was super rude and dropped the menus on a table to give back to my table.  I gave menus to my table, and had to rush in and ask the waitress to take our orders.  After she reluctantly took our orders, it took at least 40 minutes for them to serve our food!  My friends and I had to run across to taco bell, because we were starving!!!  Surprisingly, we got better service at taco bell!  After we ate our food from taco bell and came back to the restaurant, our food finally came and we ate our food.  The food was not as good as it was the previous times.  My parents bit into their rice, and it turned out to be RAW!!!!   After we ate, we needed boxes for leftovers.  The waitress did not even ask us if we needed boxes, and I had to go back into the restaurant to ask.  What surprised me was her generous service given to customers who just walked in!!  I repeatedly asked for boxes, and she finally gave them to me.  She also handed me the bill to give back to my table.  I even had to give the bill to my family and return the bill to the waitress who was sitting inside!!  The waitress basically gave us a really bad attitude and seemed irritated with us.  After my family and friends left, we were all super unhappy with the bad service!  One of my friends even told me that I was the waitress the entire time!  It was a huge mistake to come here after graduation.  I used to like this place a lot, but I will NEVER go back!! Users/Ann
  I dont get this... youve had many good experiences, but after one bad one, youre done?  Any restaurant can have a bad night.  You might talk to the manager and see what sort of a response you get.  Or, try the restaurant again another night and see if its better.  I dont give up on restaurants I like so easily.   Users/CovertProfessor

20090723 05:24:43 nbsp I love their pumpkin curry dish! Yummy! I like KetMoRees and Thai Bistros soups much better though. Users/Ilovetacos

20091110 21:59:22 nbsp Thai Nakorn is by far my favorite Thai restaurant in Davis. I was just there for lunch today and ordered the pad kee mow (drunken noodles) dish. It was just as delicious as the first time I ordered it there. The waiter was very friendly and our food was brought out very promptly. Users/Tillandsia

20091118 14:24:15 nbsp This place has the best curry and pad thai in town.  Their other dishes, Im on the rocks about.  I tried one of the dishes that included beef in it, and the meat had a rubbery taste and it was incredibly hard to chew and swallow.  Still, this remains my fave. Thai place in town. Users/ElizabethLee

20091211 17:09:46 nbsp oh i went in here with my fiancee and we had the roasted duck in curry and pad thai. they were both good, but the portions for a lunch was small. we were still hungry at the end. however, im in love with the curry. it was delicious. i will return soon :) Users/ChiYang
