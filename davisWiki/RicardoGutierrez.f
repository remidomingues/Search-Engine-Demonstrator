20100521 17:54:57 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki, Mr. Gutierrez! A fellow wiki editor has http://daviswiki.org/Verizon?actiondiff&version225&version124 restored the comments you deleted from the Verizon page. Generally, comments (both positive and negative) are kept for historical purposes. I also noticed that you may have been involved in http://wikispot.org/Templates/Wiki_Directory_entry?actiondiff&version288&version187 creating the page. If you are the business owner, please see Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner.

That said, the revert was not intended for the bit about the discount. Ive taken the liberty of adding it back. In the future, feel free to integrate whatever information you may have directly into the article  youre part of the community too! (Just leave comments be.) Happy editing! Users/EBT

20100521 18:07:39 nbsp Thank you...still about the discount it seems a bit rude. Every one can recieve a 25% discount on accessories or more, its on the back of our business cards, so there is no supposedly about it. If I can I will edit that to read the way we want it to, and will not touch the comments. Thank You, Ricardo Users/RicardoGutierrez

20100521 18:09:16 nbsp Feel free to do so! I included the supposedly bit because I was not yet sure of your identity at the time, therefore could not confirm the information. PS, regarding the townies are not as cool bit: Some editors tend to insert their own dash of dry humor when writing. Most readers are well aware that any biases on the page dont necessarily come from the business owners themselves, and know to take it with a grain of salt. In any case, statements like those are fair game for removal if you feel that they are inappropriate. Users/EBT
