Davis, 19871994

Hi!  Im Rich Lindvall and our family lived in Davis from 1987 to 1994.  Before moving to Davis, we worked with http://www.wycliffe.org/ Wycliffe Bible Translators for eight years: Rich in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia Colombia and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea Papua New Guinea and Kristy in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia Malaysia.  Our first house in Davis was at 630 Anderson Road, a rental owned by the Emil Mrak Mrak family. We soon purchased a house of our own in East Davis at 2429 Temple Drive.  Some great years for sure. Our son Micah, then later Ruthie and Karis were born up at Woodland Memorial Hospital.  Sweet memories of walking down to Slide Hill Park or over to Birch Lane School with our kids.

Internationals, Hikes, Picnic Day!

We did a lot of reachingout to international students over the years.  Many great meals/English classes/seminars with friends at the International House.  What a great place with so many ways of taking part in welcoming the world on our doorstep!  We also enjoyed long walks along Putah Creek, apparently the inspiration for Tom Fogertys (Creedence Clearwater Revival) song http://www.youtube.com/watch?vP4yugdZUt0 Green River.  One of our favorite annual events was Picnic Day and in particular the Picnic Day Battle of the Bands.  Such an incredible venuethere on the grassy banks overlooking Putah Creek.  Our favorite was the http://youtube.com/watch?vdrV1hG1yTY Stanford Band (sorry Aggie Band) with their usually hilarious drum major.  We understand that in 2007 our own http://osumb.oregonstate.edu/ Oregon State University band even took part!

A Tale of Two Churches...

For five years we were members at Grace Valley Christian Center. As part of Gerrit Buddingh Gerrit Buddinghs cell group we became good friends with Clarks, Grensteds, Steven Smiths, Bonettis, Moroskis, Bassos, Lischeskes, Johnsons, http://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/~spencer/ Spencers,   Hashagens. Others we remember are the Spartzes, Chapmans, http://www.tdlgv.org/images/profiledwight.jpg Morejohns, Users/CliftonBurton Burtons, Manderfields, Users/DaleSorbello Sorbellos, Bimsons, Peter Droubays, David Merkel Merkels, Trotters, Dyers, Craig Giannini Gianninis, http://www.calnursesfoundation.org/images/lary.gif Farvers, Jackuras, Users/ronpina Pinas, Roths,  Daniel Washabaugh Daniel Washabaughs, Robys, Solers, http://www.gracevalley.org/gvca/images/thompsons.jpg Thompsons, Ron Gulys, Clumpners, and of course Reverend P. G. Mathew Pastor Mathew and Gladys. When we first began attending Grace Valley we felt as though wed died and gone to heaven.  We experienced an amazing sense of belonging to a lifelong group of committed believers.  It was only after we began inquiring about the inner group known as flock that we became concerned about the extent of control the leadership exerted over people.  In a series of progressive revelation oneonone meetings with the leadership, we were gradually brought to an understanding as to what joining flock entailed.  As it was finally explained to us, if we were in flock every area of our lives would be on the table for the leadership to touch.  And the clinching question:  Do you trust God enough to allow Him to direct you through us?  Yikes!    We understand the Biblical concept of discipleship, but this was something http://www.reveal.org/library/thirdparty/wellspring_otherside.html beyond that!  We also were becoming more aware of a pattern of http://daviswiki.org/Grace_Valley_Christian_Center/Allegations public humiliation of members who were out of sync with the Reverend P. G. Mathew  leadership.  In 1992 we left GVCC over our concerns related to http://www.spiritualabuse.com/ Spiritual abuse.  To this day we continue to be http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunning shunned by our friends there.  (A number of friends who once shunned us have since left GVCC and are now shunned themselves.)  We found new friends at University Covenant Church, especially the http://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/~hunt/ Hunts, Sorbellos, VanZanten/De Ropps, Houcks.  Thanks, guys, you were lifesavers for us!  UCC was truly a place of refuge and healing for our family.  (For more on this chapter of our lives check out the Recovering From Spiritual Abuse page!)

On to Oregon!

We moved to http://philomath.wikispot.org/Users/RichLindvall Oregon in 1994 and are currently living http://www.youtube.com/watch?vNtpqQA_9pdM&featurerelated out in the country near http://www.el.com/To/Corvallis/ Corvallis.  We continue to reach out to international students, now at http://oregonstate.edu/ Oregon State University, home of the mighty http://www.osubeavers.com/ Beavers.  :)

P.S.  Im in the process of creating the wiki:LBCHEW Linn Benton Christian Home Education Wiki and also one for wiki:corvallis Corvallis and another for wiki:philomath Philomath, Oregon.  Feel free to visit!

20071024 19:34:44 nbsp The photo alignment trick used to be the only way to align a photo a few years ago on the wiki.  Sometimes those old workarounds come in handy.  :)   Its still always better if theres a local photo uploaded, as that means the photo is under Creative Commons and can be used by other people and wikis... but youd need to be the photographer (or have the photographers or image owners permission) to do so.  Nice work slowly and steadily documenting that little corner of Davis. Users/JabberWokky

20071030 08:57:45 nbsp Hi Rich, thanks for sharing your experience with Grace Valley above. That sounds pretty scary. Can you add some text or links that would make Recovering From Spiritual Abuse centered more around Davis? Maybe by linking your userpage or others on the wiki detailing abuse, churches in general, etc.? Users/CraigBrozinsky

20071101 10:11:08 nbsp Hah, well, theres still a lot more of it that I couldnt get photos of because it was closed off.  During the late fall, wiki:santacruz: Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk they are only open on weekends, and I happened to be there on a weekday when most of the stuff was closed.  Luckily I live just down the street, so someday in the near future Ill get more in depth with it, take some more photos. Users/MaryLieth

20071102 01:44:17 nbsp Wow! Maybe you should consider writing something on the wiki:santacruz:Santas Village page about what you remember, even if its just a description of what it was or some little anecdote.  Most people Ive talked around my age dont know of it (or know only by the highway 17 sign).  The Scwiki is sorely missing a lot of historical information, due in part to the fact that there is just so much that has happened here Users/MaryLieth

20071103 09:45:22 nbsp My wife (getting her doctorate here at Penn State) is a research chemist, and we both like small towns in nonfreezing climates.  Im a business owner and can work anywhere.  If you list the small towns with research universities below the heavy snow line, Davis is on the short list for us to return and settle into.  Add the proximity to large cities with good arts and theater, and it is quite possible well be returning.  Of course, life is delightfully unexpected, so who knows... Users/JabberWokky

20071203 13:00:57 nbsp Re: the seed stub... the image used in the DavisWiki is from me... feel free to copy it.  Basically, just create an entry named Seed on your wiki, and then you can use {{{Include(Seed)}}} to add it.  Check out the Seed entry here for an example to work from. Users/JabberWokky

   No worries, I figured this was the case. The {{{comments}}} box only adds the box for comments, you could just put a {{{}}} which should turn into a line, and have the comments below that! Have a great night!  Users/StevenDaubert

20080519 14:52:08 nbsp Hello Rich and Family, Thanks for the picture posted. It is good to see such manifold blessings in your life.

Our son Nate and his wife Melissa attend with us and Toby and Rebekah were married in 1999.They are at the Sovereign Grace Ministries Pastors College in Maryland with a vision to plant a church in SF. Please pray him and his family as they prepare over the next year for this launch. Looking forward to hearing more from you by email or wiki.

God bless you all, Ron and Sue Piña <rpcolada AT hotmail DOT com> —ronpina  I must caution you, and unfrotunately the pattern seems to be following this family to some extent. You mentioned your involvement in a church that was following shepherding or authoritarian abuse. And someone (shown above) commented that her daughter wqas now married to a pastors college candidate with Sovereign Grace Ministries. I wish it were not true, but Sovereign Grace Ministries is guilty of EXACTLY THE SAME THINGS you former church was that you left! (and sounds like this woman also attended) Please warn her and her daughter. If you goggle SGM and cult, or shepherding you will find lots of info on the movement and its history, change to calvinism suddenly, etc. Change in leadership, deceptive practices, etc etc. Just oculd not read that post without responding. I fear for her family if they are involved in SGM in any way, esp in leadership. GOd bless. Check out sgmrefuge.com and sgmsurvivors.com for more stories of spiritual abuse similar to your own. God be glorified.  Users/Concerned

20090511 08:15:28 nbsp Hey Rich, could you add an intro and some links to provide context to the essays youve been posting?  Some of them are a bit puzzling if you just come across them, and most are dead ends, with no link to get back to related entries.  I added an intro to {{{A divine indictment of abusive leadership, and a divine promise of restoration for the abused}}}, but ran into the additional problem that I wasnt exactly sure the context of the entry myself.  Basically, Im thinking that an introduction to provide people with enough information to understand what they are reading and links to read more would be really helpful on those entries.  (I know when I first started reading them, I was stumped as to the context, and am not sure I fully understand their context even now). Users/JabberWokky

20090616 12:56:10 nbsp Thanks for deleting the list of names from the recovering page. I heard my name was on there and it bothers me that someone would put it up. I guess its like outing someone without their consent. It is my story to tell. I still dont understand why you created the page for the merkels though. Hes not a public figure and my guess is he doesnt know all of this info is published on the web about him. You are very involved and I recognize your sincerity, but dont assume others share your zeal about connecting themselves publicly to this church. Let them create their own pages and share their stories. Users/lddavis

20120727 12:48:00 nbsp I was attending grace valley for while.  After a year I noticed their leadership has a problem. This church is a cult church.  And I remember pastor preaching his church is the best church n his books that he wrote should only read. I feel bad that I became a member. They were forcing me to become a member. Also this church gossips a lot when people sin. Thank you Clifford for sharing this. We need to tell more people about this church  Users/enrique
