Richard Bobo has been using the Front Page Davis Wiki since he moved back to davis in May (2006). He loves the site and finally decided to make a profile so he could critique the various businesses and events he supports and experiences in Davis.  Hell be sure to add more information on here later.

 So I moved out of davis that december (2006) but now Im back again! Im now a Junior transfer at UCDavis. So Ill be living here for then next couple of years. Totally exciteddddd!


I love Richard Bobo!  Users/DanXie Dan Xie
