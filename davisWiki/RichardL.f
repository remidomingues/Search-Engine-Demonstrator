Howdy, Richard.  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  The term Cow Poly is often used with a great deal of pride as a nickname for the school by people who remember their years there with great love.  Its often drawn out into a school pride cry: Cooooooooow Poly!.  Id say that the term Cheeseheads sounds worse, but is no less a term of pride in being from Wisconsin.  See also Little Tomato (or Sacramentos more common nickname of Big Tomato), another term that may seem negative, but used with pride.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
