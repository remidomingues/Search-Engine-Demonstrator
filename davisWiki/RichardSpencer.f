Mike and myself have a policy of not responding to private requests to alter material on Davis Wiki.  The best place to discuss removal of the Grace Valley material would be Grace Valley Christian Center/Talk. Users/PhilipNeustrom
  Perhaps a further explanation is helpful  please correct me if im wrong in any way, Philip.  Mike and Philip have, from the outset, decided that, as much as possible, the Wiki should be run by the consensus of its users.  Except for occasional administrative tasks that, for computer security reasons, only they are able to do, they have insisted that they should not wield more power on the Wiki than anyone else.  Even for these special tasks, except in emergency situations, they attempt to allow the community to come to consensus on any action.  You are welcome  make that asked, by me at least  to join the community and contribute to this consensus.  For one example of how one somewhat similar situation has been resolved in the past, you may wish to look at Sams Mediterranean and http://daviswiki.org/Sam%27s_Mediterranean/Politics?actionrecall&version168 Sams Mediterranean/Politics.  This is not necessarily how other situations will be handled, and if you think that situation was and is being handled poorly, you should convince us.
