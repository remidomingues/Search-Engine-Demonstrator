Howdy!

Im Richard (friends call me Char or Charizard because of my infatuation for Pokemon). I recently moved out to Northern California from Provo, Utah.

Im currently finishing up my first year of the Graduate Students graduate program from the UC Davis Economics Department.

I love Horses horseback riding, vintage pogs, and Movies romantic comedies.

Im still not comfortably familiar with the city of Davis, and would love to continue exploring what this small town has to offer!
