On May 9th, 1981, Richard Avedon, a fashion and news photographer, took a picture of Ronald Fischer entitled beekeeper.  One of his more famous works, this was taken here in Davis.

In it, a white man with a shaved head stands against a stark white background.  Across his face and naked torso dark bees crawl over his skin.  This black and white photo was chosen from a shoot that included various facial expressions of pain and other emotions.  In the final image selected, he stands serene.

Avedon had advertised for several months in beekeeping magazines looking for a model.  See the Ronald Fischer page for his comments about the shoot.
