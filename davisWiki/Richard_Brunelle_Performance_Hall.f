The Richard Brunelle Performance Hall on the Davis Senior High School campus is named for Richard M. Brunelle. It is wheelchair accessible. It is amazing, Has vaulted ceiling for lots of set pieces (and the pulley system for quick changes) and is generally a very awesome hall
. It sure kicks the stuffing out of the old DHS drama practice area

Also see the Instructional Performing Arts Center.
