20110121 21:08:03 nbsp When several dozen parents, coaches, and students came to a 1/20/11 school board meeting to express their concerns about why the district fired DHS basketball coach Jeff Christian, Harris was obnoxious and rude to the speakers, repeatedly telling them to hurry up and gesturing with his hands to finish talking.  Harris was completely uninterested in what they had to say.  Memo to Harris: when parents, students, and other members of the community come to a school board meeting to talk to you about an issue that is important to them, you should listen.  Its part of the job.   Users/Burns
