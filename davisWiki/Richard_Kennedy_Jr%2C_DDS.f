20080317 15:37:21 nbsp I really liked Dr. Kennedy and his staff. Unfortunately, he doesnt take Delta Dentalyou have to pay him up front and then request reimbursement from Delta. Since he charges significantly over reasonable and customary rates, you wont get full reimbursement. I had to stop going to him as a result. Users/NancyWallace

20090310 12:10:35 nbsp Dr. Kennedy and his staff are great.  The dental exam is very thorough and the cleanings make your teeth feel nice and shiny.  The staff is great and soooo nice.  We love going here. Users/LauraBruno

20100125 09:36:51 nbsp I think Hes a great dentist.  The staff is nice, all very professional.  Unfortunately, I cant use him as he is not a participating doctor in any insurance plan, so hes out of network for all dental insurance  add that hes expensive atop that (as others indicate well over any insurance reimbursable rates) and if I try to use him, I pay over a thousand dollars more for the same work  for one appointment.  Hes good  but not a grand more good.  Sad day, but I gotta move on...  Not a good time in the economy to be hittin people this hard Doc. Users/KenK

20131125 13:41:48 nbsp WARNING. Nice person, yes, competent dentist, NO. I saw Richard Kennedy for four years before moving to the bay area. Each time I saw him he informed me that I had no cavities. He would say, Well, it looks like you have some tooth decay here, but theres nothing to be concerned about. Well just watch it. Just came back from a routine check up at my new dentist... 4 cavities and a broken filling that requires a crown. New dentist doesnt know how ANYONE could have missed this. DO NOT GO TO DR. KENNEDY.
