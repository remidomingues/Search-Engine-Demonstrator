 Candidate Statement 

What’s up everyone? My name is Richard Yu and I am running for ASUCD Senate with the BOLD slate. Through my experience with different organizations at UC Davis, I’ve been able to see many things that can be improved upon to make operations run more smoothly. Around campus, I have many great ideas that will help improve the UC Davis campus.

PROMOTE DOWNTOWN AGGIE PRIDE AND STUDENT ATTENDANCE AT UC DAVIS ATHLETIC EVENTS.
Athletic events are huge at UC Davis. One thing that I would like to see more of is downtown businesses getting involved and supporting the teams. In order to promote UC Davis Athletics and Aggie Pride downtown, I want to start a program that will give students discounts at select local businesses for attending athletic events. The more events attended, the better the discount. It will be run online, which drastically reduces costs, is environmentally friendly, and will be user friendly. Students will be able to log in and view the promotions and discounts they qualify for, which will depend on the number of games one attends.

FUNDRAISING SEMINARS FOR UC DAVIS ORANIZATIONS
As a fundraising coordinator for Camp Kesem, it is challenging to raise tens of thousands of dollars in this economy. I want to start fundraising seminars that are available to all UC Davis students and registered organizations. The seminars will feature local community members that frequently plan fundraising events. It will teach students how to manage their time wisely and be able to plan successful events while staying on top of schoolwork.

MAKE IT MORE AFFORDABLE FOR CLUB SPORTS AND ORGANIZATIONS TO RENT ASUCD FACILITIES
UC Davis has over 30 club sports and over 180 student organizations! One major reason is that club sports do not have easy access to campus facilities. I want to make campus facilities, such as the Pavilion, more affordable for club sports to rent for their events – this will be vital for many of the sports. If you are able to play in a nicer and more centrally located setting, it will draw a bigger crowd and more fans. Also, by making facilities more affordable to rent, there would be more student events on campus and the on campus facilities would help make fundraising and recruitment events more successful.

Remember, VOTE RICHARD YU #1 for ASUCD Senate and BOLD #26 and Adam and Bree for Pres/VP!!!
