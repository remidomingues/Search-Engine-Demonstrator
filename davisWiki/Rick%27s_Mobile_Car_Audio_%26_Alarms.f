Do you need car audio, alarm, remote start, or interior work done on your car? Look no further than Ricks Mobile.  Rick is a straight shooter with very competitive prices, he is also licensed, bonded and insured. He has 22+ years of experience in the installation game and is also a pretty cool guy.

He carries Prestige alarms, Omega Excalibur alarms, K9 alarms, Panther alarms (the one this Daubert wikizen got), JVC, Jensen, BOYO rear view cameras, Lightning Audio, Kicker, Renegade car audio and much more. He services all makes and models. He is usually booked about three to five days out.

Rick is a stud & Im going to refer anyone who needs install to him. He was very clear and concise & addressed all my concerns in a very professional manner. He also does very tidy wiring work which is a hallmark of a good installer. The alarm / keyless entry / remote start system I got was competitively priced with his pro install & Rick was was prompt & punctual. Daubert
