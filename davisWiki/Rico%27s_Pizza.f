20061103 22:13:05 nbsp It was a closed campus in 19871990, but if you had permission from your parents, 9th graders could go off campus at lunch time, but you couldnt go further than a 1/8 of a mile, so, Ricos was really the only game in town! Users/AdamFlowers

20100526 03:21:17 nbsp Oh gosh I remember this place. The wooden salad bowls, the ribs, the stupid Aerosmith arcade game that scared the hell out of me. I seem to remember that the owners moved before the space was bought for other uses. I could be wrong. My love for everythingbutthekitchensink salads started there... cottage cheese, beets, sunflower seeds, and ranch dressing all the way! Users/KBathory

It was a good place for kids birthday parties as they had a giant pizza as big as a table and free balloons... Not the best pizza but affordable. All you can eat Wednesday night. The east Davis locals would stop for their nightly pitcher(s) in the back off to the left, watch sports on the big screen and stagger home into the neighborhoods... nobody cared in those days as long as you walked home...

One of my UCD coworkers worked there at night as a sleazy delivery guy... He used to help himself to free beer at the end of the night and order all the young waitresses around during clean up... He supervised of course... Users/LouisM
