The address(rifle range, 38.5361, 121.7508) behind King Hall hasnt been a rifle range for years. It currently houses some of the business office for Facilities Management.  There is an almostcompletely faded RIFLE RANGE sign above the door (youll have to look very closely!)

At one point this was the ROTC rifle range and held their armory. It has been remodeled to the point where the main clue for its previous life, aside from its name, is its thick roof.



Where, exactly, was this?  users/JoePomidor

20080626 21:21:41 nbsp I took Basic Riflery here in Winter Quarter 1996 as a PE class.  It was pretty fun.  We shot .22caliber rifles, IIRC, and I seem to remember there being six or eight lanes.  Where does ROTC practice now? Users/MattJurach
