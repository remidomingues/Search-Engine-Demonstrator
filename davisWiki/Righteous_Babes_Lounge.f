The Righteous Babes Lounge  nice cozy lounge located in the UC Davis Womens Center on campus. There are two comfy chairs couches, a heater/air conditioner and even a bean bag chair. In the closet there is a TV with a VCR and DVD player (although be warned that the VCR eats tapes). Great place to hang out, study, or relax with friends.
