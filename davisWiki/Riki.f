Riki is a compact shop that manages to convey a sense of elegant simplicity and spaciousness. Like an upscale art gallery, the decor is neutral beige and offwhite. The proprietor designs her personal line of readytowear ensembles, separates and accessories. She has a wide variety of dresses, blouses, jackets, tank tops, camisoles, pants, and slacks that have drawn a loyal following to her label. The materials used to make the apparel ranges from taffeta to lace, silks, cotton and wool. The shop has a nice selection of accessories for your new clothes. This shop has expanded to include two other boutiques in the Northern California area, in http://www.rikidesign.com/boutiques.shtml Berkeley and http://www.rikidesign.com/boutiques.shtml San Francisco. Riki has recently expanded their shoe department to include a selection of dress and casual shoes that have been chosen to complement the clothing designs.
