Riley belongs to CatherineRichardson. He is all kinds of big and dumb and lovable  not so much as a thought in his head, but lots and lots of energy. He is also a friendly dogs dog.  When excited he produces copious amounts of highly viscous drool.

What kind of dog?
 I believe that would be a hound dog, sir! And livin the life of Riley, no doubt.
