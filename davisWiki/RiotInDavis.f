He is currently a cohost on the punk rock radio show Neonate (Fighting For A Future) (formerly Neonate (Under Distress)) with his good friend Users/PunkRoge Punk Roge.  Stay up Saturday night right after http://www.joefrank.com Joe Frank at midnight until 2am to give a listen to http://kdvs.org/shows/view/show_id/543 Neonate (Fighting For A Future) on KDVS 90.3FM.  Users/PunkRoge Punk Roge has been playing Punk Rock on the radio forever and has many great stories about the punk rock history of Davis.  Another good friend who was doing a radio show is Trotsky from Woodland.  Trotsky left the country but we hope to see him around these parts again.  Also to note, Users/PunkRoge Punk Roge and Riot play http://www.joefrank.com Joe Frank for you every Saturday at 11pm to midnight.  If you have never heard http://www.joefrank.com Joe Frank before you are in for a treat.  KDVS  definitely brings good things to life on the air.

Another good punk rock friend in Davis is Users/MickMucus Mick Mucus who is always a fantastic performer.  Dont miss seeing him play in one of the many bands hes been in.  Also, his KDVS radio show on Tuesday nights at 9pm is strange and wonderful so dont miss it!

In the spirit of punk rock and volunteerism, go out and make a change in peoples lives.  Anyone can do it.  Check out the Food Not Bombs Food Not Bombs DavisWiki page to find out more.

How Riot Got His Name: People always ask me this.  It all came about when I had this idea to create a line of clothing, boots, etc. which I named RiotMoshGear.  You could use this gear in a mosh pit as well as in a riot.  (I always loved the style of Mad Max and bondage gear)  So, when I was coming up with an online name I came up with RiotMoshGuy which I shortened to RiotMG.  Over the years I got tired of this name.  I can go by RiotAAA (Riot Against All Authority), or my artistic name, M. Riots, although I usually go by Riot or DJ Riot.

Punk Activist: If you arent working for a better tomorrow what the hell are you doing?  Punk has always questioned authority and gotten into its face.  Take a stand, make change.  I believe my friend France Senecal would agree.

Zinester: Short run zines include Scarf This Material, Enlisted Void, and a scifi zine named BigFoot.  I still have copies of Scarf This Material if youd like a copy.

Poet: Been into free form poetry since I was very little.  I like coming up with images in my head and putting them to paper once in awhile.

Here is Riots Running Man:
  Running man! Running man!
  Run fast man!
  Running man! Running man!
  Faster than the shackles man!
  Running man! Running man!
  Why you running man?
  Running man meet tripping man!
  Im tripping man! Im tripping man!

I call that poetry in action!  Davis seems like a good place for poetry.  Ill have to post some more poetry in the future.

Artist: Ive been into art since before I can remember. I love seeing other peoples art and I love doing artwork. I dont think Im that good because I dont have a lot of time for it these days but I do love doing art when I can find the time.  Here is a link to computer artwork I did as a memorial for Brian Deneke (if you do not know who that is you better go look at his page because we cant lose more great people like that in this world): http://www.briandeneke.org/somesunshine.htm  I did this back in 2000 as RiotMG
I wish Robert Crumb R. Crumb was still around this area.  I love his artwork.  To me art is a way to do something in a creative way which doesnt exist.  It can have many different meanings but it is always something created from the artist.  My favorite artist is H.R. Giger and I really love the dark artwork.  Much of my artwork is very dark and strange.  I agree with Giger that it is good to get the darkness out of your system by doing artwork instead of locking it inside.  It can be very therapeutic.  My artwork can also be humorous because I enjoy doing things which make people chuckle.  But Id have to say most of my artwork is strange and dark.  I like doing strange art because I find it more interesting.  It doesnt always make sense but it can definitely make you think.  Ive more recently been interested in political artwork.  I hope to pursue political artwork more when I have time.

Other Interests: British Comedy, SciFi, Movies, Independent Movies, Comic Books (no longer collect but still love them), Making fun of stupid things like bad movies and advertisers trying to sell you crap like Look, youll be loved by all if you buy this ridiculously priced exercise machine youll never use!  Only $49.95 (in 5 payments plus $39.95 s&h)!  Buy in the next five minutes or forever be a loser damned to hell!  Hahahaha!  Good stuff!
