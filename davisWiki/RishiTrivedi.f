20050127 03:09:13 nbsp I would vouch for Rishi, but he needs no vouching for. Users/GeoffJohnson

20050208 13:38:12 nbsp make a page about the contents of the time capsule Users/RishiTrivedi

20050213 20:00:16 nbsp I found a page about a person on wiki that was edited by a frequent user.  It was a Firstname Lastname, not FirstnameLastname page.  The user wrote some pretty embarassing info that happens to be documented and verifiable.  There was nothing constructive about the comments.  I see no one, not even the user, benefiting from this.  But its truthful.  And now, its public.  Therefore, it cannot rightfully be removed.  I really want to tell this user how big a jerk I think he is.  I think hed probably want to make a Firstname Lastname page about me. Users/RishiTrivedi

20050213 20:03:39 nbsp Dude, just comment on the page and say you dont think its fair or representive.  Just because its true doesnt mean it ought to be there. Users/PhilipNeustrom

20050213 20:12:57 nbsp I dont want to draw attention to it.  I wish I could just delete it. Users/RishiTrivedi
