Riki Hayashi had lived in Davis from 1988 until 2010 when he moved to Virginia working in the field of his dreams Judging and writing for the DCI and Star City Games. While serving as the roadie for legendary Sacramento rock band Magnolia Thunderfinger, lead singer Skid Jones decided that Riki needed a cool nickname. Riki has responded to Risky ever since, and would prefer to be known that way on DavisWiki so as not to be confused with a certain Riki womens clothing store.

Risky is a Level 3 DCI Judge for the card game Magic: the Gathering. He certified (Level 1) in 2004 at Grand Prix Oakland. For the next few years he bounced back and forth between playing and judging the game. In 2008 he certified for Level 2 and judged at his first Pro Tour in Hollywood. Since then he has worked at every Pro Tour on the schedule, including Berlin and Memphis in 2008, and Kyoto, Honolulu, Austin, and Rome in 2009. Hes been equally active on the competitive Grand Prix circuit, judging events in San Francisco and Daytona Beach (2007); Philadelphia, Denver, and Atlanta (2008); and Los Angeles, Seattle, Boston, Tampa, and Minneapolis (2009). He was promoted to Level 3 at Pro Tour Kyoto in 2009. Risky is often called upon to be the Head Judge of mediumsized events including a Starcitygames Legacy Open in Charlotte, the California State Championship in 2009, and numerous Pro Tour Qualifiers all over the state of California.

Risky has written extensively about the game of Magic for numerous strategy websites, including http://www.tcgplayer.com TCGplayer.com, http://www.starcitygames.com Starcitygames.com, and http://strategy.channelfireball.com/tag/rikihayashi/ Channelfireball.com. Since 2008, he has written the column titled The Riki Rules, primarily focusing on judging and rules issues in the game. In 2010, it was his history of writing articles for the game, as well as his judging status that garnered him his dream job of traveling judge/correspondent for Star City Games based in Roanoke, Virgina.

20100125 09:49:29 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. Please see the Identity page. Your edit was questioned because you had the unfortunate timing to step into the middle of an active page without having any establishing edit history and a pseudonym for a username. Stick around, introduce yourself and all will be well. Users/JasonAller

20100125 10:36:58 nbsp Hey, no need to be so snarky and nasty back if there were misplaced assumption.  You stepped into a case where two people are either being duplicitous or making threats.  If youre not one of them, thats fine, however for the past several days there have been lawsuits intimated, people making demands of other people theyve never met and all kinds of highhanded jackassery.  Yes, it is quite possible that you stepped in at the wrong time, but look around you.  Theres a guy named William, a guy named Jason, myself (yes, my wife calls me Wokky, and it says Evan Edwards on my license).  Meanwhile, youre named Risky, and youre posting a very oddly formally worded statement that is less a review than a bullet point list of the regulatory features of the place, which is precisely what has been the center of the tomfoolery.   Now, if thats not honestly questionable, I dont know what is.  Sure, you may be a real person  but do you really go by the name Risky?  Honestly, youre more than welcome here on the wiki, but blasting people for a very reasonable assumption is a pretty rough start, and I fully apologize right now for anything I said that insulted you.  I honestly thought your edit was clearly just another part of the stupidity, and never meant to hurt you.  So, lets start over:  Hey, how you doing?  My names Evan.  My phone numbers (814) 8898845 if you need any help with this wiki stuff.  Im a volunteer editor, just like everybody else here.  Were a community of volunteers trying to document all the cool little things about Davis, including gaming stores, sidewalk crack project sidewalk cracks, the grass sidewalk places where there arent any sidewalks, and even the color green.  More important things, too, like the history of University Farm and Davis during World War II.  Its pretty cool, and Im glad you  added your voice to the effort (no matter the timing or reception).  My wife worked at Wizards and was a Magic fanatic; whats your name?  She might have met you if you traveled here and there, although she worked there in the early 2000s.  Myself, the last time I was at a gaming tourney, TSR still owned AD&D.  And it was AD&D.  :)  Dont worry about the rough start... although the editor name is a bit odd, and as Jason points out, you might want to reconsider (unless you go by that name; I go by JabberWokky in real life, so Im pretty much an outlier for names myself), but then, theres no hard and fast rule that you have to use your real name; were pretty casual here.  In fact, were pretty durn friendly here most of the time; you just caught the brunt of some misplaced frustration.  I am utterly honest and earnest when I apologize for my part in making you feel at all unwelcome and wholeheartedly say, Welcome to the Wiki!
