This new salon was opened by Risto Pelivanov. You may have known him from The Style Lounge on G Street. He brought Kyle and Tiffani with him to the new location. The salon is in a cute little house across the street from Little Prague and ACE Hardware. There are bike racks and wheelchair access right in front of the building.  They typically have coupons in the Little Green Coupon Machine.

20100717 14:09:57 nbsp This place is brand new! The music and ambiance are great, no Top 40 here! I went to this salon looking for Tiffani, but she only works on Fridays. Kyle did my hair and it is AMAZING! Hes really great with short hair on ladies. You can tell that its something he really enjoys. He knew how to texture and style my hair to keep it feminine, but made sure to ask questions so we were on the same page. They charged me the same rate I was used to at Style Lounge ($25, my hair is really as short as a guys cut), but Im not sure what the typical price range is. I will definitely be going back!

20100812 15:45:01 nbsp Im so glad I found Kyle who was previously at the style lounge!! He did an amazing job cutting my hair and is really gentle :) The first time I made an appt with him, I had long, somewhat wavy hair and I wanted short layers with a style that would allow my wavy hair to have volume with defined waves/curls, which is exactly what he did. I love the way he cut and razored my hair, I highly recommend him!

20100812 18:55:00 nbsp Does anyone know the price of a cut for womens hair, specifically by Risto himself?  He used to do my hair at Style Lounge and I LOOOOOOOOOVE him, hes wonderful!  Users/IstiRae

20100918 11:47:31 nbsp I love Risto!  Have been there twice now in the new Salon  Great atmosphere, Risto does a fantastic job and has absolutely wonderful assistants as well!  Stop by, enjoy a Cappuccino while getting your hair done! Does not get much better, especially in Davis Users/marabella

20100921 13:23:51 nbsp After looking at the salons on the wiki and on Yelp, I decided to go with Kyle. He did a great job with my hair. Highly recommended. Users/BenFogelson

20101201 21:04:12 nbsp I saw the place on my way to work and impulsively decided to make an appointment.  Kelsey did my hair and did a great job! I wasnt quite sure what I wanted, but she listened well while adding stylish touches.  I have shortish hair  the cut was $40 and well worth it. Users/Hyungmi

20110202 20:17:41 nbsp Love this place the staff was great very friendly, Vanessa gave me exactly what I wanted, my bangs are perfect, it was an amazing cut!!! Will be coming back!! Users/Camy

20110419 18:35:53 nbsp I really love this place. Ive been here twice now and both times Ive gotten fantastic haircuts! I will never get my hair cut anywhere else again, last time I did I ended up with poofy uneven bangs..  I just got my hair cut by Jennifer here and she did an amazing job on my bangs, totally fixing them up... also, she gave the most amazing head massage ever! I also got an amazing hair cut here a while ago from Kelsey, my hair looked awesome without having to do almost anything to it.  Users/MonikaDarko

20110825 12:26:44 nbsp Vanessa has been my stylist for about a year now. She does a great job and is always fun to talk to during the haircut. She makes the time go quickly! Users/ChrisVincenti

20111013 15:02:24 nbsp This place is more awesome than the word awesome can convey. Kyle has been cutting my hair for almost 3 years now, I followed him from the Style Lounge, and I am  happy that I did. Kyle has a gift for making his customers look a feel great.

Vanessa has also cut my hair here when I could not get a hold of Kyle; she is AMAZING! She did an awesome job of styling my hair after I donated it to Locks of Love. Users/RyanDoody

20111130 09:57:36 nbsp I followed Kasi from the Style Lounge and completely love her! I highly recommend making an appointment with her. She always gives me exactly what I wanted and I always leave happy.  Users/SharesHope

20120412 15:09:22 nbsp After moving to Sacramento in the summer of 2010, I had frequent Davis withdrawals, and still came back often for errands and such. Over the years, Ive slowly replaced my errands with local Sacramento shopping, with the exception of Kyle, who is now here at Ristos. Awesome guy, awesome cuts, and totally worth a trip across the causeway.  Users/DavidBenjamin

20120529 17:25:16 nbsp I followed Leslie here and I will focus on the salon itself since Ive already commented about her on her page.  The salon is very clean and organized. The owner promptly and warmly greeted me upon my arrival.  The other stylists were polite and professional as well.  Very good atmosphere. Users/LoriOrf

20121110 19:05:13 nbsp I never usually comment on the wiki, but I got my hair cut and colored by Jessica this morning and she was great!  I didnt know exactly what I wanted and had a lot of problems with my hair, but she listened to my concerns and then helped me find a cut and color that worked for me!  She didnt try to rush me through my appointment and even flat ironed my hair at the end.  She also didnt try to push a bunch of products on me.  I will definitely be going back to Jessica for my hair cuts! Users/JulianeSmith

20130531 18:06:43 nbsp Kyle is such a rockstar. I always leave feeling like a total bombshell. Most recently, I asked (challenged) him to even out my home color job and make it closer to my natural color. Nothing short of a miracle, and he pulled it off. AND he cut my hair into a beautiful style after. Thank you Kyle! Users/BombayCollins

20131114 13:15:26 nbsp I absolutely love Kelsey! Shes a saint, she saved my hair two years ago when I absolutely DESTROYED it with bleach and dye, and she always does exactly what I want, while tweaking the style a bit to make it individual. Shes also so sweet, shes easy to talk to and makes you feel so comfortable, I dont trust anyone else with my hair. This place is great. Users/HannahBohte

20140528 16:34:43 nbsp My doctor at Kaiser has gorgeous hair, and she told me she has been going to Risto for many years.  I made an appointment right away, and I was not disappointed.  I wanted extremely short hair, and Risto cut it in the most beautiful way!  Even when it was growing out after several weeks, it was beautiful.  Ill be going to Risto every 8 weeks for the same style, and I hope he never leaves Davis!   Deborah Users/DeborahLattimore
