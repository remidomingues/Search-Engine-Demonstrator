Rita Hosking is a Music Scene local musician and teacher at Emerson Junior High. She sings folk and bluegrass music with her band, Cousin Jack, which has members of the Mad Cow String Band.

From her website:  Rita Hosking was raised in the mountains of eastern Shasta County, Northern California, where she internalized dusty woodsheds, the scent of springwater, forest fires and the troubles of rural economies. Her musical experience began as a child at church, and under the wings of an old time jug band made up of seasoned mountain characters. A descendant of Cornish miners who sang in the mines, Rita grew up with deep regard for folk music and the power of the voice.

On an old Gibson guitar her friends bought for her, she began composing songs at age 20. Still writing and now performing with her band Cousin Jack, Ritaâ€™s bluegrasstinged, soulful songs convey mountain life in the West with a voice that evokes the power of people and place.
