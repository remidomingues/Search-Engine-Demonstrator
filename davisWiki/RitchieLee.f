Describe Users/RitchieLee here.
Hi Ritchie, and Welcome to the Wiki!  I restored the Southeast Asians Furthering Education page because outdated information doesnt need deletionjust updating!  If you know the updated information, you can add it there.  If youre concerned about outofdate contact info, you can note on there that its no longer current, or something along those lines.  And if the organization is completely gone, it can be marked as no longer in Davis.  Its existence is still a part of Davis history, though, and we like to keep records of that kind of thing here on the Wiki.  Users/TomGarberson
