Rite Aid is a drug store that has all kinds of good things, like 2liter bottles of cheap Big Fizz soda. Since the first location is close to the dorms, it serves as kind of a grocery store to many freshmen. They develop Photography film here (1hour and overnight), but stop processing at around 6PM (so, drop it off before then for 1hour service). They sell Western Union money orders and also process Western Union Money Transfers.


The Rite Aid on Russell sells beer and wine, but not hard alcohol, which is available at the South Davis Rite Aid.  Rite Aid has a Thrifty Ice Cream counter with the cheapest ice cream by the scoop anywhere. One scoop for $1.29, two for $1.79, and three for two dollars, including tax.  The Thrifty Ice Cream in containers usually goes on sale every few weeks.

Rite Aid carries many store brand items that are equivalent to name brand products such as Tylenol, Robitussin, Claritin, and so forth. They contain the same active ingredients but they are often several dollars cheaper. These store brand products are just as effective and safe as brand name medications. These medications are tested and have met standards to prove that they are as safe and effective as brand name products. You can save quite a bit of money this way.

Rite Aid stores have a rewards card that offers you sales prices and UP Rewards. For example, when you buy specially advertised items, you will get an UP Reward coupon for $1 off your next purchase. It is just like getting free cash for your next purchase. You can use the coupon the same day, by dividing up your purchases into separate transactions.

By the way, dont use online photo ordering.  Their servers are extremely slow and Rite Aid often doesnt get the online orders till a few hours, even up to half a day.  Its faster to bring in your digital media.

Rite Aid also accepts JCPenney credit cards. Rite Aid took over Eckerd, which was owned by JCPenney, and also inherited the ability to accept those types of cards.

At one point the location of the current Russell Blvd. Rite Aid was occupied by State Market, a grocery store.

They also have a Pharmacies pharmacy.

PHARMACY INFO:

Both Rite Aid locations will check ID for alcohol, cigarettes, and medicine (usually cold/allergy drugs with decongestants) that have phenylpropanolamine or pseudoephedrine.  They MUST check ID for pseudoephedrinecontaining drugs due to the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005, which seeks to limit perperson possession of methamphetamine precursor chemicals.  People have been buying huge quantities of pseudoephedrine to make meth.  Read more about FDA pharmacy regulations http://www.fda.gov/drugs/drugsafety/informationbydrugclass/ucm072423.htm regarding sale and purchase.  All pharmacies across the country must check IDs and record signatures of people who purchase pseudoephedrine products.  Its best just to have your ID with you when you buy any medicine.  Also, if anyone is with you when you buy something along those three, their IDs will be checked too. Pseudoephedrine containing products are only sold behind the pharmacist counter.  There is a purchase limit of 3.6 grams of pseudoephedrine per day and 9 grams in a 30 day period.

The South Davis Rite Aid has a drivethru which makes picking up prescriptions easier.

They offer a AAA discount on prescription medications at the pharmacy. This can save you a lot of money, so it is best to ask about discount.

Rite Aid used to match any competitors prices. For example, Target has a list of generic drugs for only $4 for a 30 day supply or $10 for a 90 day supply. 01/28/2011  asked if they price match at the North Davis pharmacy and the pharmacist said no Apparently, this policy varies from store to store.

You can now get the new seasonal flu shot at either Rite Aid store. Just talk to the Pharmacy staff. This years flu vaccine protects against H1N1 as well as other strains of the flu. Other vaccinations are also available.

  Gotta love ice cream on a hot Summer day!



20060403 17:04:27 nbsp The pharmacy at the South Davis RiteAid sucks. The longhaired blonde pharmacist just looked at me as I waited for help. BAD customer service. Users/DavisLurker

20061207 16:10:14 nbsp The pharmacy at South Davis really is horrible. They never have my prescriptions filled on time, and for some reason, they can never find the prescription they filled, and spend 15 minutes looking for it (even though theyre supposed filed in alpahbetical order). My suggestion is to order your refills online and specify a  pickup time a good two hours before you want it. Users/RachelPeters

20061207 19:42:50 nbsp I dont get the layout of the South Davis store...for some reason, they arranged the aisles in a jumbled, herringbonelike pattern. I assume its to keep people shopping longer...?  Every extra minute I had to spend wandering in that maze only strengthened my resolve to never return.  Is the Russell store like that too? Users/DukeMcAdow

  20061230 13:15:38 nbsp Ive never been to the Rite Aid in South Davis, but the Russell Rite Aid is relatively easy to navigate, partly because its a small place. It can be hard to find certain items, though, because theyre not really listed on the top signs above the aisles. Users/AlexanderHo

  20070122 14:47:29 nbsp Okay, its actually a bit annoying to give people directions on where to find certain stuff.  Our cosmetics section is organized so we know how to get to stuff, but I can see the difficulty for people in finding stuff there.  Its easier for me, sometimes, to just lead a person to the location. Users/AlexanderHo

20070122 15:00:04 nbsp I try to avoid Rite Aid whenever possible. The other day I was there to get some cold medicine and waited in line 10 minutes when there was just one person ahead of me. After I was to go to the counter to pay for my purchase, the store employee started a conversation with another employee, left the checkstand and carried on their discussion of expired coupons for another couple minutes. Horrible! Much better service at Longs where I can actually find things! Users/MyaBrn

20070123 21:12:32 nbsp I only go to Rite Aid when I absolutely have to. Theyre always understaffed and their lines are always so long with only one cashier. Everytime I go there I remind myself to send a complaint to the actual Rite Aid headquarters so that they revoke their local affiliation with the one at Russel and Anderson. I always come out of their dissapointed and often times peeved. The ones back home are a joy to go to, why do the owners of the one here in Davis have to be such cheap charlies? Users/TonyOrozco

20070201 15:40:58 nbsp Ive read your comments, guys.  Ill be sure to try to call for help when the line gets long (read: 3+ people.)  Im also going to bold the part with the ID, because it seems that people still dont get that part.  Every single day, I tells ya... Users/AlexanderHo

20070415 20:36:02 nbsp I seriously dont know what all the complaints are about.  Long lines?  Get over yourself, especially at the Russel+Anderson location since its probably the most heavily studentcongested store in the area.  If theres a really bad line, go to the pharmacy which almost never has more than one person or even the costumer service kiosk.  I am sad that they took away the little tv with all the rugrats and pokemon episides that I could watch while sitting in the massage chair (also mysteriously vanished), but I even go to rite aid just to play with the toys and try on the shoes while my gf shops for cosmetics.  Plus I have ever so fond memories of the Thriftys ice cream back when the store was still called Thriftys. So cheer up, emo kids, and next time head for the discount clothing racks and clearance candy bins; maybe buy yourself a pair of tube socks and a tie for a couple bucks.  Itll make you feel like your grandpa, and seriously, whos more badass than grandpa? Users/TylerFelix

20070415 20:57:19 nbsp i like rite aid! the people that work there are way chill. Users/JessicaRockwell

20070429 02:04:33 nbsp I find that Rite Aid has a consistent and better beauty/personal care selection than Longs does. Though I do wish Rite Aid would carry some natural beauty alternatives that Longs carries, like Burts Bees. Longs pharmacy, though, is very good and they are extremely helpful. Users/ArielaHaro

20070512 14:51:25 nbsp Its probably easiest to explain the level of competence of the Russell and Anderson RiteAid with this story: whilst trying to buy some of the perfumes they keep in that locked cabinet I was told they couldnt sell them to me because they had lost the key. Months later, the key has remained lost and instead of getting a new one cut, they just stack boxes in front of the cabinet. Dont believe me? Go and see for yourself! Really, you couldnt make it up.  Users/drhanszarkov

20070512 16:38:57 nbsp Do they still have those big bottles of soda for 99 cents? Those are the biggest soda bottles! Users/Jedron

20070525 13:20:15 nbsp 1.  Hmm, Ill have to ask about that key.  Regarding the boxes, though, we put the boxes there because I think thats a pretty central location for us to put the cosmetic boxes on load day, so we can attempt to stock them as quickly as possible.  Probably coincidence, being in front of the perfume.

2.  We still sell the big soda, but its 1.19 now.  Still a pretty nice deal. Users/AlexanderHo

20070525 14:07:20 nbsp Rite Aid not only checks ID for pseudoephedrine, they force you to swipe your drivers license or state ID card which is stored in a database. I had a conversation with a Rite Aid employee that went something like this:

Arlen: Why do I need to swipe my ID?
Rite Aid employee: Its the law.
A: What law? State or federal?
R: Uh... both?
A: Ok, what information are you taking from my ID?
R: I dont know.
A: What are you doing with it? Is it being stored? Where is it being stored? How long will it be stored for? How can I be assured that my personal data will be safe?
R: I dont know
A: So why should I swipe my ID?
R: Because Im not going to sell you this pseudoephedrine if you dont.

Thanks guys, its now safer and easier to buy meth than it is Sudafed. Next time, Im bringing my Passport. Users/ArlenAbraham
  Oh come now Arlen, most times employee at places like Rite Aid, Safeway, Walgreens, Target, etc etc etc are paid poorly and put at a register. You should have asked for a manager, who MIGHT have known why they do something like that, but most times youre just getting a kid who needs pot money and doesnt know (or really care) why something is done. Users/MichelleAccurso
  Hey, I resent that comment.  Youre implying that a good amount of the employees in the Rite Aid here are potsmoking kids.  Im personally saving money for a plane ticket to see if I can get an internship in Japan, and most of my coworkers are not of college age. Users/AlexanderHo

  It is a law that went into affect for all pharmacies April of 2006 that IDs much be checked for any product containing pseudoephedrine.

20070525 14:17:54 nbsp At my local (nonDavis) Longs, the pharmacist diligently copies my (Davis) address off my license and into a classic B&W composition book.  She has yet to notice my married name sitting on line 2 underneath my maiden name; Im not entirely sure whether this constitutes purchase under a false name.  Russell RiteAid swiped my ID, too, but theyre the only pharmacy Ive run across that does so.  South Davis Safeway swiped my ID for alcohol once; everywhere else just glances at it. Users/JudithTruman

20070531 10:07:56 nbsp ID swipes?  What is this?  Something new?  Im missing out of action for a few weeks, because Ive only checked ID, not actually swiped it.  As far as I can remember, Russells Rite Aid has checked ID only, not actually swiped it.
  Edit: Ah, now I see.  So ID swipes are done for the nonprescription stuff thats behind the counter.  Users/AlexanderHo

Regarding the key thing again: apparently, the manager does have the key to the perfume area, so I dont know exactly what was with your situation. Users/AlexanderHo

20070601 12:52:49 nbsp Why does every rite aid close at 9 and earlier on the weekend? back in the day at the dorms i wish so many time that this place was open for late night munchies?   thats enough to make say this place sucks, on the flip side, they do have cool clothes. Users/KyleLanderhoffis

  20070602 23:15:49 nbsp Rite Aid doesnt close at nine, it closes at 10.  Every day, including weekends. Users/AlexanderHo

20070915 21:50:38 nbsp Hello.  I will never ever visit Rite Aid again, even if my life depended on it.  They are rude, nasty and sexually harrased me with their sexist and racist comments.  I contacted the RideAid 1 800 number and was met with typical, if its Tuesday day press 1,235.  I reached the complaint department and a woman started laughing at me.  She said the store did not ?and she said things that were not trueshe was not a witness     Forget RITE AIDsexist bureacrats who hate customers.  I asked for the manager, and he was rude.  Well keep your rude behavior, stay defensive and nasty I am not longer a customer.  You make me feel uncomforatble, I dont like the tone.  I am an AfricanAmerican woman.  Not a hey girl! Users/Marjorie

  nbsp While Im sorry to hear of this, I find it hard to believe this could happen at the North Davis Rite Aid...or hard to happen, period.  Care to tell which Rite Aid this happened at?  I worked on 9/15, so I might be able to see whats up.   Hey girl couldve just been a friendly greeting, after all, and I cant see this happening at the North Davis one simply because I cant imagine my coworkers being anything like sexually harassing or racist.  The South Davis one?  Well, theres that one assistant manager who everyone complains about, even back when he was in training in North Davis, so if it were at South Davis, I might understand. God, that guy...Users/AlexanderHo

20070916 23:22:43 nbsp Um, just to let everyone know Im not blaming riteaid cuz I know its the law bolded above, but last year I had a nasty nasty cold and was VERY upset when I couldnt purchase nasal decongestant because I was 17. . .I had to make my roommate buy it for me a couple days later. . it was really pathetic. (later that year when I had really bad heartburn I was able to buy zantac 75 no problem. . but sudafed. . .noooooo) Users/KellyCorcoran

  nbsp Yeah, tell me about it.  I often get really odd looks from the people who try to buy them, then I have to go Yeah, federal law, blame that.  Or blame the abusers, I dont know.  I believe other drugstores card, too, if it makes you feel better \  Users/AlexanderHo

20071203 21:21:25 nbsp Today I went to the Rite Aid across Segundo to get my photos developed. I used the machine, humming happily while I selected which ones to print out.  An hour later, I went back and asked the lady there where were my photos.  She told me that they didnt print out... and she saw me selecting it. Her attitude wasnt much to be desired too  But the biggest problem I had was... WHY didnt you tell me when I was selecting??? So I headed across the st to Ritz.   And the cashier didnt give me the receipt when I was there. That made me extra pissed. Users/EvelinaChang
  Sorry to hear that.  I do have a question, though: Were you, by any chance, trying to print a 3x5 photo?  Ive seen a lot of people try to print that lately for a project of some sort, and Ive had to tell them to go to Ritz, since we cant process that.  Im not sure what happened in your situation, though. Users/AlexanderHo

20071212 13:35:33 nbsp 3x5 photos are for the des 001 class. Users/Tho
  Ahhh, thanks.  Did Ritz Camera manage to process 3x5 photos?  Users/AlexanderHo

20080201 17:11:22 nbsp Around Halloween they sell a toyelectric chair there. I went and complained about this pervert stuff I was forced to see when buying medication. The first person I talked to said shed pass it on to the manager, but I guess never did. The second one just laughed at me. Hey  you could sue if theyd display any nudity  but having a toy execution tool on display seems to bother nobody. A pervert play with the pervert concept of capital punishment. Im not going to buy there ever again.  Users/NewDavisite
    NewDavisite, if that is in fact your real name, would you please be so kind as to elaborate on the problem that you have with the electric chair.  Seeing as how you pointed out that it appears around Halloween the seems to be fairly appropriate.  Users/GeorgeLewis
         20080203 08:27:33 nbsp George 1: using a pseudonym isnt a sin or something, get over it. And in case you couldnt tell, thats not a real name, its a pseudonym.  2: A toy electric chair  to a person whose religious or moral codes teach that the taking of life is sinful or evil, this is a fairly obvious perversion of something already wrong into what you could term an evil teaching toy Since the idea that killing is wrong is a fundamental part of the religious teaching of a great many people in Davis, this could be seen as a silent majority view and not a single nutjob yelling.  Users/PopeChristof
               Pope, thanks for clearing that up for me.  I am now aware that NewDavisite is not a real name.  I agree that using a pseudonym isnt a sin; I dont know of anything that actually is a sin.  Perhaps if you have some spare time you could read Importance of using your RealName and you might understand the importance of one using a real name on a wiki.  That really wasnt my point when I stated if that is in fact your real name in my previous posting, it was more of a joke.  I am still not sure I understand the problem, but I appreciate you taking time to respond.  Users/GeorgeLewis
    Perhaps NewDavisite is commenting on the social ideas of the United States, period.  Condoning capital punishment but not nudity?  Hmmm hmm hmm!  </Bad attempt at overdone observation of the US>  Users/AlexanderHo
    20080204 17:20:24 nbsp NewDavisite ... The Rite Aid employee probably laughed at you because youre being absurd. you shouldnt care so much about these things, so stop being so anal. you focus too much on things that dont even matter. and you complain to employees that cant do anything about it. if they take it out of the store, the corporate headquarters is on their case. so why not complain to the corporate head where you can actually enact some kind of change, instead of just getting pissed off at local people just trying to make some money to pay their bills. obviously, you have never worked in customer service positions before. take down the whole holiday if you want, just do it on your own time and quit making trouble for others.  Users/voiceofreason

20080221 20:00:36 nbsp Ive never left a comment on Davis Wiki before but I have never in my life been treated so badly by pharmacists as here. Once I went in to buy a hot water bottle and the 18 year old pharmacist replied Uh, like to drink tea? Its one thing for the pharmacist to be frustrated because they have long lines, but you shouldnt start lashing out at your customers for no reason. These are some of the rudest people Ive ever encountered in my life and I would recommend to everyone avoiding this place if at all possible (the one on Russell). I dont know if their pay is really low, if they work too many hours, or if the manager abuses them but never ever again.  Users/bradjones
  I lold at this comment. seriously THATs your big beef with RiteAid? I mean Im all for bad mouthing the place, Ive wasted too many months of my life at that dump but just try and read your comment from the perspective of someone who wasnt with you at the store that night and youll see how absurd you are Users/RW

20080328 22:07:48 nbsp Items at the Russell location are seriously overpriced. I cannot contest for the South Davis Rite Aid, but the one across from campus is ridiculous. Ive done comparison shopping and noticed a lot of the smaller/ cheaper items are marked up over 100% compared to other stores. Stay away from this store as much as possible. Users/hanknguyen
    Ive had plenty of people comment on this one.  Personally, I think its what I think as The price of convenience.  Yknow, that stores close to campus and such, so property is probably more expensive, and Rite Aid knows they can make more money that way by marking up because its so close to the students.  Most people wouldnt want to bike out for 10 minutes more to Safeway or such. Users/AlexanderHo

20080328 22:37:49 nbsp Rite Aid is currently in a bad financial state. They have a heavy debt load and the company is losing money. Their stock price has fallen to dismal levels. They are bordering on bankruptcy. It makes sense since their operations are poorly managed. Users/Jedron

20080405 07:56:26 nbsp You want poor pharmacy service, try Longs in East Davis.  Utterly indifferent.  I switched two prescriptions to Rite Aid on Russell, what an improvement.  Picked them up at 5:30 pm on a weekday with no wait at all.  Longs would have been a 20 minute wait. Users/RalphFinch

20080517 01:08:09 nbsp I really dont know why people are complaining about the South Davis locations pharmacy staff. I have been going to this same RiteAid for 3 years now and have always received my medications on time (except for the odd instances where the manufacturer runs out of stock or my insurance company is being a pain in the arse). In fact, I have a good relationship with the head pharmacist as well as four or five of the people who work behind the pharmacy counter. This may also be due to the fact that since Im diabetic and have many medications, Im in there at least two to three times a month picking up medications.

As for the attitudes of the people behind the regular check out counters, thats an entirely different story... Users/VincentShin

20090107 15:51:18 nbsp The pharmacy has an insane mark up, beyond all reason to ever shop there. I went to fill a prescription there and it cost me 320$. The next time, I filled my prescription at a Longs, and it cost 140$ for the exact same thing. A huge markup may be bearable when you items cost 520$, but this is just ridiculous. I am not ever getting my medication there again. Users/lmccart

20090108 02:01:24 nbsp For some reason, they have a policy that they cannot give somebody a dollars change in quarters.  Not really relevant, but kind of bizarre and a little inconvenient.  They rip enough money off of unassuming freshman that Im sure they could spare a four quarters in exchange for my George Washington, youd think. Users/sososharp
   What?  I have no problem with change a dollar, or even two dollars, and I dont think the rest of  the (night) cashiers do, either.  Anything more is something else, since our store is actually pretty limited in quarters.Users/AlexanderHo

20090115 21:08:22 nbsp Whats the deal with their giant 1hour photo sign (at Anderson/Russel) when they dont even have 1hour photo? The first time I went in there with my girlfriend they said the pictures would be done Definitely back by Monday We got them a week and a half later instead, and it was too late for her project. If you need pictures developed go to Ritz Camera over by Gottschalks, they are very quick.

  I wish the Ritz camera store were still around! I got a recommendation for the Kits Camera and Image shop on J St in Sac... but there isnt a closer fixit shop? Plz, enlighten me...  wiki:davis:users/maia

I do like the RiteAid though. Despite being a small store they sell some cool seasonal/holiday items, and a surprisingly large sexual accessory display. Well, surprising until you remember its across the street from college dorms. The vibrators and lube they sell are pretty good. Users/OrofinJackson

20090204 15:42:53 nbsp They have that giant sign out front saying Longs drugs customers, hurry and transfer your prescriptions. I knew Longs Drugs had got bought, so I asked about it at the Longs pharmacy and they said they are still going to be doing our prescriptions there! PHEW! Thanks for the scare Rite Aid, but you wont gain my business from it.  Users/Rachelottlinger

20090820 23:30:36 nbsp One time the north davis rite aid had sex toys in the front aisle. I believe it was around Valentines Day. My friends and I chuckled as we lined up for the cashiers in front of the aisles. Users/WengFF

20090914 15:06:11 nbsp The one hour lab in the South Davis location has been out three times in a row, within the last month. Reasons range from no operator to no chemicals, or as I was explained once by a clerk, they dont process FILM in one hour, only digital. Upon calling the store to check the status of their one hour operation and later speaking with the Manager (Monday), she recommended coming in on Wednesday  which kills the point of needing a one hour turnaround. Going to Ritz across town is very disappointing since our lab is literally next door, walking distance.  Users/Alex

20091007 00:48:20 nbsp What is the cost of the flu shots here?  Does the Rite Aid near campus offer flu shots too, or just the one in South Davis? Users/IDoNotExist

20091122 22:38:17 nbsp I love this Rite Aid because I live at Sycamore Lane and its super convenient. The people working there have always been nice to me.  The only complaint I have is when I purchased their Revlon make up during their buy 1 get 1 free sale.  Okay, that foundation SMELLED SO BAD!  I would hold my nose while I applied it.  So, I returned it (PLUS for allowing returns on makeup)!  Then I bought another bottle a couple of weeks later because I ran out of foundation and it was no longer on sale.. This time, it smelled normal (had minimal to no smell) so I kept it.  So.. I agree with whoever wrote that comment about being aware of the possibility that this Rite Aid sells old/expired make up. Sometimes, you can really tell because the consistency is .. not okay. Users/ElizabethLee

20100112 19:44:36 nbsp I had the misfortune of having both bronchitis and pneumonia at the same time. Not to mention having to work 10 hours a day with no sick days available at this time. I had to wait an hour (Was told 5 minutes, then 20, then another 5)I had trouble standing. Then I get told its because they are so busy. I WAS THE ONLY ONE THERE! I asked to see a pharmasist to learn about the meds and I was refused! Once again because they are so jam packed. After dealing with being lied to I had to go outside for a smoke before I could tell the manager what piss poor employees he has. These people suck and I will be going to Target from now on. Users/Dozer
 Not to pick on you but if you had bronchitis and pneumonia at the same time, you really shouldnt be smoking too. Users/OliviaY

20100220 18:50:22 nbsp I frequent the Russell/Anderson Rite Aid simply because its so close to campus, and I absolutely loathe the fact that there is one single line going down an aisle, and not a line forming from each open register. WHY is this?!?! I cannot stand walking in there and not know where Im supposed to get in line, and WHY there isnt AT LEAST a Line Forms Here sign??

If the Rite Aid employee is still checking this, what is the deal with that? I seriously hate going to this Rite Aid for that reason. Still working on a letter to the Managers of this store. Users/redbike

20100818 16:16:00 nbsp Recently, Ive had very good service at the South Davis pharmacy.  What I hate are the tricky pricing schemes.  I bought two cans of nuts that I thought cost $2.99 each, but they rang up at $3.99, even with my Wellness card.  I had the cashier suspend the sale while I checked the sign.  I said, My fault, it says Ill get an up reward, so its like paying $2.99.  An up reward is $1 toward your next purchase.  I said to go ahead with the sale, but got only one up reward....there was fine print saying theres a limit of one per customer.  I dont want to study fine print when shopping.  Just post the price without gimmicks, please!!! Users/Linda

20110131 17:20:57 nbsp I actually like the Rite Aid Up Rewards. Dreyers Ice Cream (1.5 qt.) was $2.99 today. You get a coupon for $2 off your next purchase. That makes the ice cream only 99 cents. What you can do is pay for the ice cream and get the $2 off coupon on the receipt. Then purchase the rest of your items and use the $2 off coupon from the first receipt. Its like free money! Users/MaxLucas

20110412 00:14:29 nbsp Im writing under my boyfriends account because I recently had a rough experience at the pharmacy. I went to rite aid to pick up my antibiotics, cough syrup, and inhaler. There was little to no wait time and the help was friendly. However, I was instructed by the pharmacist to take my antibiotics with a small snack. Upon getting home and reading the instructions on my medication it said take with crackers, bread, or a small meal...so I ate some yogurt. It just also happen to say Do not take antacids within 2 hours of taking this medication. As an EE major, I have little background in the bio sciences...so besides tums and alkaselzer plus, I had no idea what an antacid was. My pharmacist did not warn me that yogurt works as a natural antacid! So I spent the next 6 hours vomiting with a 102F fever. Id suggest going to a different pharmacy where the pharmacist take more care and have more experience in explaining how to take your medication.  Users/kiddmit3
  While I dont know what exact medication you were taking, I do know that some antibiotics should not be taken with antacids or dairy. The reason is that some antacids contain calcium and dairy products contain calcium. Dairy products include yogurt, milk, and cheese. Calcium binds to the antibiotics and makes them not as effective as they could be. However, the antibiotics should work to some degree.
For example, Do not take Cipro with dairy products such as milk or yogurt, or with calciumfortified juice. You may eat or drink dairy products or calciumfortified juice with a regular meal, but do not use them alone when taking Cipro. They could make the medication less effective. So it is ok to eat dairy with some antibiotics as long as the dairy products are eaten with a small meal. It is not ok to eat a dairy product alone, such as eating yogurt alone.

 Usually, if a drug is not to be taken with dairy, the bottle should be labeled with a warning sticker that says Do not take with dairy products. CVS Pharmacy uses these stickers on their medications. The computer automatically prints out warning stickers that tell you what foods not to take with medications. I dont know if Rite Aid has a similar computer program. CVS also prints out a paper that tells you all about your drug and lists side effects, foods not to take, and other important information.
 If you look up the exact drug on the internet, you can find out exactly what foods not to take. There is a lot of information on the internet and choose websites with good reputations such as drugs.com  Users/MaxLucas

20110430 11:31:59 nbsp The RiteAid on Russell: WHY does it only have one person working a single register??? That Rite Aid is so busy! PLEASE put more people on the registers. Every time Ive been there the line has been so slow. I feel bad for the cashiers because I know they do the best they can, its an issue of management, so Im not hating on the employees. Also, I would recommend that you reorganize the store so that the line doesnt go down a random narrow aisle, its very awkward and hard to tell who is in line and who isnt. I have accidentally cut in line several times because I was confused about where the line started, and if the line is long, you have to walk around the aisle to the back to get in line. Its just weird. I think they should have lines at each register instead. Other than this, not much to say, its just a standard Rite Aid. When I get prescriptions filled they always offer to sit down and go through the information with me, which is really nice. I like the GNC ministore and the selection of food like the pasta sauce. When I ask where to find something the employees are helpful and friendly. Users/AbigaleMoody

20110615 20:03:59 nbsp The one at Russel Blvd is awesome. The cashiers are nice. One of them even remembers me. (If youre reading, you know who you are lol). Users/WengFF

20110804 16:06:42 nbsp Long live State Market.  Any old timers will remember that cool tall (whole place was painted white) column in the front of the building, beautiful 50s/60s architecture. Users/OldDavis73

20121029 23:47:20 nbsp The line at the Russell location is often very long.  Probably partly due to understaffing but also the employees who move at the same pace whether there is no line or its ten deep. I dont need a fake smile, I need to get in and out in under 15 minutes. Users/ScottB

20131109 18:21:44 nbsp I hate this place. All I wanted was cough syrup so i could sleep easy tonight and no
they ask for my ID and I for one wasnt informed getting damn cough syrup was so exclusive.
Not only do I stand at the pharmacy for 20 minutes to ask what product am
I even aloud to buy to get better they simply shoo me away like if Im some sort of delinquent.
Pharmacists are useless and so is everything in that store.

NEVER COMING HERE AGAIN. So mad and irritated. I guess Ill have to sleep or sweat out this flu with soup.

 A law was passed and took effect January 2012 requiring that stores check ID and only sell cough syrup with dextromethorphan (DMX) to people 18 and over. When either chugged in large quantities or processed into an extremely potent form, DMX can produce a euphoric, almost hallucinogenic, high often called robotripping or dexing. The California Poison Control System reports that DXM abuse calls for children under age 17 have increased 850 percent in the past decade, making DXM abuse the most commonly reported type of abuse in this age group. Governor Jerry Brown signed the bill into law making California the first state in the nation to take such a strong stance against DXM. This rule applies to all stores and not just Rite Aid. You will face the same hassle at Safeway, CVS, Target, Walmart, etc. Users/MaxLucas

20140430 09:07:13 nbsp Both RiteAids are consistently out of stock on my prescriptions. Frustrating because back home RiteAid is the best place to pick up my meds, and I dont really want to deal with switching over to another pharmacy. However, I may have to. This is the fifth time theyve been out of stock, and I cant keep starting my prescriptions a day or two later than I should be. Users/MelanieKim
