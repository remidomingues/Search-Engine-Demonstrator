20090526 15:26:26 nbsp This is the worst bank I have ever seen, having an account in their bank was a mistake. Once my address in their database was changed to something random, their website is unsafe and once I wasted an hour until they managed to set up a PIN on my card. Do not repeat my mistakes, do not go to this bank. I am an international student, to be honest, and I faced a lot of miscommunication too, which was not common for me in other banks. Users/Mantas
