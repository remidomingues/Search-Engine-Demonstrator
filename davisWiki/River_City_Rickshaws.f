River City Rickshaws was the premier downtown Sacramento / Davis transportation pedicab operation and provided the smoothest ride of taxi services pedicabs to serve the downtown area. These threewheeled pedal cabs, the descendants of rickshaws, are powered by trained, licensed, and insured drivers who provide a fun and practical mode of Climate Change green transportation. These modern day pedicabs use the technology of 21speed mountain bikes, rear hydraulic brakes for safe braking, and rear axle differentials for tight turning.

There are many ways to catch a ride on a pedicab: you can flag a cab down, have a prearranged ride, or a rickshaw for hire.


Flagged Down Taxi

      If you see a pedicab, simply talk to the driver about where you want to go. The driver is an independent contractor and can negotiate the fare with you. Tips are appreciated! Often the driver gives advice about different restaurants or events and is a shortterm tour guide for you.


PreArranged Rides

      Often people arrange transportation for special events, such as group rides, weddings, parties, or historic tours. The quickest way to check on pricing and availability is to Email: Mailto(sales AT rivercityrickshaws DOT com)


Rickshaws for Hire

      From time to time River City Rickshaws are hired or sponsored for weddings, grand opening, special events, parties, or by an advertiser to give free rides for a specific place and time. Pedicabs can be transported by truck for special events outside of the “normal operation area”. If your function is not within downtown Sacramento or Davis area, contact us for pricing and availability.

20080904 07:35:34 nbsp Several rickshaw companies operate (operated?) in downtown West Palm Beach.  Modern rickshaws are really quite nice way to get around downtown on a night out.  For barhoppers its a good way to avoid Bicycling Under The Influence BUI, and its a nice way to get around on a date night. Users/JabberWokky
