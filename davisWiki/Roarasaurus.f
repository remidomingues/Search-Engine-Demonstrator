Roarasaurus  Im interested in knowing how you were able to deduce so much of the network infrastructures configurations at the Ramble. Users/ICL

ICL  In the same way that I was able to deduce your approximate location in Austin, TX from your IP address. I have a higher level of understanding than my comments on the Ramble page may indicate. Theres just no incentive to go into further detail about your network infrastructure (e.g., public IP configurations), ways to get around packet shaping (getting more than 12x12), or how Ive figured all this stuff out.

  Can you just put that stuff up at the top of the entry?  It should probably be under a header lower on the page (most people dont care too much about such things), but that info  especially the outage table  should be more prominent on the page.  If you feel uncomfortable, Ill do it in a bit. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, jw.dw@timewarp.org
   Duly noted. Ill make the changes once Im done dealing with the rigors of finals week. Users/Roarasaurus
      No worries.  Its just a suggestion: I think that info is worth highlighting and making more visible.  Its well compiled. jw

Thanks for all the new pictures!!   Users/CovertProfessor

Love the animated rain picture. Im glad The Ramble page doesnt read like a huge advertisement any more. Users/argyle
  Yeah, the picture is totally cool, and makes the point perfectly.   Users/CovertProfessor


Good catch. Also still a fan of your Ramble ramblings ~SD
