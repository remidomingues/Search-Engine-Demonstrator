  It is loosely associated with First Baptist Church, many members go to various churches in Davis and the surrounding area.  Dinner is served at 6:30 PM and the actual study begins at 7:00 PM.  If you are looking for fellowship and want to dive into the Word, this is a great place to do just that.
  We are an independent group led by Jonnalee Henderson, Rebecca Wilson, Ryan Greif, and Moises De La Torre.  Many members attend FBC, including the leaders.  If anyone has an issue they would like to address outside the group, the FBC leadership is available to provide counsel, oversight, and accountability.

 Bible Study 
  We are currently doing a study of the book of Acts and taking a look at the history of the Christian church.
  If youre looking for a Bible study full of great people, Roaring 20s wants you!
  Relationships and the Bible are the two key ingredients of our weekly Bible study on Wednesday evenings, 7:00 pm
     Feel free to arrive anytime after 6:30 to hang out and join us for dinner.
     Its informal and relaxed so visitors are always welcome.
