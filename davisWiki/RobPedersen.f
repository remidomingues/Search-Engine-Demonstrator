Rob Pedersen is a Transfer Students transfer student coming from UC Riverside.  He is obviously one of the coolest people who ever has set foot on the UC Davis campus.  A Procrastinating procrastinating history major, Rob rarely reads any assigned readings.

He has some major connections, however.  With Users/StephanieHammon Stephanie Hammon as Robs journalist friend who can help him out in a jam with her press pass, and Jesus as Robs homeboy, there is no situation that either Stephanie or Rob cannot overcome!

Rob is a charter member of UC Riversides chapter of Phi Alpha Delta, so it comes as no surprise that Rob graces UCDs Phi Alpha Delta chapter with his presence, along with Users/AlvinTsao Alvin Tsao.

One of Robs greatest accomplishments so far in his first year at UC Davis is reading a pirate story on air at KDVS KDVS on Users/JenndelaVega Jenn de la Vegas radio show.

It is rumored that Users/KrisFricke Kris Fricke seeks out Robs expert advice when making very critical decisions regarding ASUCD Court proceedings.


20050604 13:19:15 nbsp Rob is the unofficial (I can try to make it official) Supreme Commander of Phi Alpha Delta. What this job entails no one knows, but like most important jobs when the time comes hell know. Rob is a relatively new edition to our frat and I for one think he deserves all three awards he won at this years spring banquet. Good guy despite being as pale as a vampire. Users/AlvinTsao
