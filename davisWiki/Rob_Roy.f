Robert Roy successfully ran for ASUCD ASUCD Senate Senate on the Friends Urging Campus Kindness slate in the Winter 2005 ASUCD Election.  In Winter of 2006, likely due to disagreement regarding the Fall 2005 ASUCD Election/Unqualified Candidates Scandal unqualified candidates issue of the fall 2005 election, Rob renounced his affiliation with the Friends slate and declared himself an independent.  One of the novel ways in which he campaigned was a video of him rapping about the issues that faced the current ASUCD Senate and his platform points.  He has since stated: I feel guilty about some of the stuff in that video, now being a senator and having the gift of hindsight. I was a little harsh. But at that time ASUCD was not at its best in reaching out to the students or having the students best interests in mind. But I tried to be fair.

Rob Roy was a candidate in the 2008 City Council Election. He spent less than $250 on his campaign and ended up in last place, receiving 4,504 votes (which does mean that 31.8% of people voting, voted for Rob). His website is http://www.voterobroy.org VoteRobRoy.org. Rob ran for City Council in the 2006 City Council Election and lost, getting 5.58% of the vote.

Rob Roy officially ran for ASUCD ASUCD Senate Senate as an independent in the Fall 2006 ASUCD Election, but was eliminated in the second round, due to telling people to vote for other candidates, as was the intention of his candidacy. All of the candidates he endorsed that were running on a slate got into office.

Rob Roy also ran for ASUCD President with Users/ArlenAbraham Arlen Abraham as his ASUCD Vice President VP in Winter of 2007 as part of the Dont vote for Rob and Arlen campaign. Their intent was to increase voter turn out as well serve as an example of single transferable voting being successful. The pair also endorsed six Senate candidates (four of which won), and the LEAD Executive ticket, which was also victorious. Voter Turnout was 22% so the ASUCD Winter 2007 Unitrans Fee Unitrans Fee Referendum, on the ballot that election, met the necessary 20% threshold to be implemented.

Rob Roy also coined Little Tomato as a nickname for Davis.

I saw Rob winning trivia night on Monday... I think he wins every Monday, along with the faculty, at Bistro33. Our team did tie his for first though, but lost the tiebreaker.
