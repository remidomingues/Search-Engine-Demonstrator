Hey Robobo, your problem with attaching your image let me know about a bug.  Ill have it fixed tomorrow afternoon  right now the wiki doesnt quite know how to attach images with spaces in the filename.  Believe it or not, you were the first person to try and upload an image with a space in the filename :)  Users/PhilipNeustrom

thanks bro, its all good, i just changed the filename.
