20080109 08:44:13 nbsp  Welcome to the Wiki. Please read Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner; it will help explain how you can make the wiki a positive experience for you without clashing with established wiki social norms. Im fairly sure that someone is going to revert the comment back onto Barefoot Yoga Studio that you deleted and I suspect that based on their nature that a Barefoot Yoga Studio/Talk talk page is the best way to sort out how things should be handled. Let us know if you have any questions. Users/JasonAller
