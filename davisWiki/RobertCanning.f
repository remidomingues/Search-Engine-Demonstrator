Robert Canning is a 15year Davis resident.  I work in Sacramento and commute by train station train.  I live in http://www.villagehomesdavis.org Village Homes but soon will be a resident of http://www.oldnorthdavis.net/history.php Old East Davis.  Lately, I have become active in organizing to stop the proposed Olive Drive railroad fence fence along the tracks in downtown Davis. A little about me:  I love http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Cezanne Cezanne (particularly his http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteriaO:AD:E:1053&page_number4&template_id1&sort_order1 stilllifes which often have amazing http://www.metmuseum.org/explore/cezannes_apples/index.html apples.  I also love the work of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Diebenkorn Richard Diebenkorn, (especially his Ocean Park series), http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clyfford_Still Clyfford Still, and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Rothko Mark Rothko.  I enjoy music of all kinds, from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastien_Bach Bach, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart Mozart, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahler Mahler, and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schoenberg Schoenberg, to modern jazz by http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Davis Miles Davis, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Coltrane John Coltrane, and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Ensemble_of_Chicago the Art Ensemble of Chicago.  Ive also done a bit of http://www.supertopo.com/rockclimbing/LakeTahoeLoversLeapMainWallCorrugationCorner climbing and whitewater http://www.cacreeks.com/photos/tuolj.jpg rafting.  I own a wonderful http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembroke_Welsh_Corgi Pembroke Welsh Corgi named Sydney who is pretty bossy and has an opinion about most everything.

I truly wish I was still living in Davis (my lovely wifes career has us travelling around the country), and could participate in your efforts against a simple fence along the rails.  Matching municipal projects against the actual needs and realities of the community is a really important act, and I wish you the best in obtaining some kind of outcome that recognizes the high pedestrian and bicycle traffic in Davis.  State or national guidelines may fall short here: they arent designed for the high amount of two wheeled and foot traffic that is clustered right around the rail system in the middle of town.  Then again, state guidelines dont require lit bike lane intersections either, but Davis has them.  Best of luck!  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20101201 22:53:16 nbsp Hey, I created a central page about the Olive Drive Railroad Fence, since there are a bunch of different pages popping up about it.  Since you seem to be well versed on the issue, would you mind writing up some general info on the issue?  Who, what, when, why, how, and how muchthat sort of thing. Users/TomGarberson
