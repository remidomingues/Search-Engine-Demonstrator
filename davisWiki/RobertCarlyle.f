Welcome to the Davis Wiki. You are, unfortunately, off to a bad start as an editor. Please dont change comments by other people. Its unclear why you are choosing to denigrate Osteria Fasulo, but if you have an opinion about the restaurant your best bet is to leave a comment. It is easy, as you will see, to track edits. So other editors are likely to simply revert what you are doing. Perhaps you could introduce yourself and act a bit more aboveboard.

Your edits to Osteria Fasulo will simply be reverted, over and over, until you get the message. Stop. Users/DonShor

Wow, thats a lot of animosity toward OF.  Why? Users/TomGarberson

Being angry and bordering on abusive isnt going to get you anywhere. Everyone here is an editor. If you disagree with someones review, act like a respectful adult, make your own review and move on. I didnt and wouldnt tell you to eff off because I have no reason to. I dont talk to or treat anyone like that. Users/jsbmeb
