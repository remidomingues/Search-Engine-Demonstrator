20090327 16:17:02 nbsp Your comment RE World of Warcraft Lat. being higher than the bit rate suggests could be related to WoW using a base P2P system, making it a target for some ISPs to cap your transfer speed at an absurdly low rate.  I honestly have no idea if the ISP is doing this, or for that matter if WoW uses P2P for gameplay or just for patches, movies and the like.  You can easily test this by downloading something large like Open Office directly from the distributor, and then comparing it to the download rate of the same thing through torrent.

20090515 12:19:17 nbsp The ISP definitely throttles. A tech did it while I was on the phone with them. But its done on an IPbyIP basis, not based upon traffictype (or so it seems). Users/RobertM525

20100529 00:05:44 nbsp hey robert, i just wanted to ask if you knew why torrents sometimes work and usually dont work at the apt complex.   Users/carpenoctum

20100604 11:48:33 nbsp Robert, just a heads up: Im bumping your comment from carpenoctums /talk page to his/her main user page. Users/TomGarberson

20101101 23:14:07 nbsp Robert, thank you for your concern about the Food Coop. (Theres no reason I can imagine for the O to be capitalized.) Speaking for myself, but as a senior employee, I can say that we have been planning and renovating, with TJs as one major factor. We think that there are some places where we can compete with them, some places where the two stores do completely different things, and that we should be fine in the long run. I think that all the supermarkets in town will see some effect from having a savvy, wellrun specialty grocer in town; Id speculate that Westlake IGA will see quite a hit, although I expect theyve also been planning and getting ready.
