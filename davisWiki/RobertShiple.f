My name is Robert.

I currently work as a medical assistant, at 420 Relief in Davis.
If you ever have any questions, or concerns, regarding 420 Relief or medical Marijuana, please come and talk to me!
I will answer all your questions, and help you as much as I can.

useless facts about me:

I love beer

I love computers, punk, and design.

I wear scrubs 80% of the time.
