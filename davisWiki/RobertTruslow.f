Hi Robert, and Welcome to the Wiki welcome to the Davis Wiki.  It looks like William probably deleted the CityOfWoburn page from the WikiSpot wiki because it wasnt the right place for it.  It looks like you probably intended to http://wikispot.org/Create_a_wiki create a new wiki for the City of Woburn.  WikiSpot pages arent intended to serve as community wikis for individual cities; rather, theyre for the organization itself, including resources that are useful to city wikis. Once you create a Woburn Wiki, the place to link it on WikiSpot is the http://wikispot.org/Wiki_Directory Wiki Directory.  Hope this helps.  If you have any questions feel free to ask (though Ill note in advance that Im not familiar with the process of creating a wiki, so someone else would probably have to answer any questions along those lines) Users/TomGarberson
