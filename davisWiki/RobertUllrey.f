A resident of Woodland Woodland, I spend plenty of time in Davis Davis and have been active on several Boards for coops and nonprofit organizations within Davis. I contribute to the Front Page DavisWiki mostly as one who lives and enjoys the area and wishes better connections between Woodland and Davis.

I enjoy running and bicycling throughout Davis as well as running my English Springer Spaniel Maggie around the Arboretum UCD Arboretum.
