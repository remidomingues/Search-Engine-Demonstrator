Robert Deering was the first chairman of the program initiated at UC Davis in 1950 of a curriculum in landscape architecture leading to a Bachelor of Science in Agriculture. This curriculum was absorbed into the Landscape Management major in 1951; the goal was to prepare men and women for the practical business of landscape management and contracting . . . . Over the next decade, increasing interest in an applied horticulture program related to shade and street trees and park management produced a Park and Recreation curriculum within the Landscape Horticulture Program. In 1967 the Department of Environmental Horticulture was established with Park and Recreation Administration as one of its majors. The major was soon renamed Environmental Planning and Management.
