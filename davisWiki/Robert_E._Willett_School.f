Willett Elementary was named after a longtime teacher at the school. Previously, Willett was known as West Davis Intermediate, and served grades 46. It is now a full K6 school. Its sister school was West Davis Elementary (WDE), a K3 program located on Anderson Road. That school is now Cesar Chavez School Cesar Chavez Elementary. When WDI was going to be renamed, there was a proposal to name it after Joseph Stalin, but the proposal failed. Other suggestions were Vladimir Lenin and John Lennon.

Bob Willett was a much loved 6th grade teacher at the school. he was well known for his love of the outdoors and took his class to the mountains each year. There the students would stay in dorms and spend several days learning about nature. Mr. Willetts class also put on a musical every year.  Sixthgraders throughout the District now spend a week at http://www.scoe.net/slypark/ Sly Park.  He would get students to pay attention by hitting the table with a yardstick, breaking several over the years.  One year for Christmas, a class got him a new yardstick as a gift, signed by all students in the class.

In the Sycamore Park park that borders the school is the access to one of the Bike Overpasses bike overpasses that crosses Highway 113.

The principal, since 2008, is Heidi Perry.  The http://groups.dcn.org/wilpta Willett PTA raises funds through http://www.escrip.com/ eScrip, a yearly giftwrap sale, and sometimes an auction, and uses those funds to spend on books for the school library, to support teachers, and for many other purposes. From 2006 to 2008, the principal was Nancy Medbery.
