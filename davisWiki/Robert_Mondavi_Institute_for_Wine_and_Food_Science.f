Construction was finished on the new $100 million Robert Mondavi Institute for Wine and Food Science, and a grand opening was held on October 10, 2008 (http://robertmondaviinstitute.ucdavis.edu/docs/RMISavetheDate.jpg flier).  It is the new home of the Department of Viticulture and Enology and the Department of Food Science & Technology.  Construction was funded by a donation from from Robert Mondavi and his wife Margrit.  It was the single most substantial private donation that UC Davis has ever received.  The institute has its own http://robertmondaviinstitute.ucdavis.edu/frontpage website up and running, which details every little conceivable detail about the project, including such nuggets as Martin Yans presence on the RMI board of directors, and that he is a UC Davis alumnus.

Phase I of the construction includes the buildings currently completed  North and South buildings, Sensory Facility  as well as a new student vineyard.  The North building houses the Department of Viticulture and Enology, while the South building houses the Department of Food Science & Technology, as well as both departments counseling offices.  These buildings are predominately research space, though both possess more than adequate instructional space.  The Sensory Facility is shared between the two departments and includes instructional kitchens as well as sensory research areas.   The Sensory Facility (abbreviated RMISEN by the office of the university registrar Registrar) also includes a lecture hall that has a listed capacity of 60.

Phase II of the construction is the August A. Busch III Brewing and Food Science Laboratory.  Construction is set to begin in July 2009, and is expected to last one year.

The Institute houses several independent research centers tasked with providing useful research and extension services to Californian winemakers and farmers. The list is projected to grow as the main institute gets up and running, the RMI website currently lists the following centers:

  UC Davis Olive Center
  Center for Fruit and Vegetable Quality
  Center for Advanced Materials, Methods & Processing
  Center for Wine Economics

Land


Its interesting that people arent raising a big stink about loosing all this agricultural land, like Covell Village.


20080904 16:25:20 nbsp I can guarantee that the only reason the loss of all that Ag land didnt turn into a typical Davis debacle was that construction took place on land owned by the University. They dont have to abide by the towns antigrowth legislation.  Users/SMCareBare
