20070413 09:38:40 nbsp Dr Phillips is a great and gentle dentist, plus he has a treasure trove of DHS Yearbooks in his waiting room going way, way back. Users/EdHenn

20070413 10:32:51 nbsp My whole family sees Dr. Phillips.  I love that he uses warmish water for rinsing  helps with the cold sensitivity some of us old guys suffer.  Also, although he doesnt have virtual reality goggles or any other fancy hightech gadgets to distract you, he seems to be up on the latest in genuine dental technology (though really, how would I know?).  Plus, his magazines are always up to date! Users/DanLawyer

20070413 16:05:56 nbsp He has been the family dentist for years, its good times. I love the train sets that line the walls Users/StevenDaubert

20090113 13:08:11 nbsp Very friendly and personable, and seemingly very reasonably priced (we recently moved from the Bay Area so my expectations may be off).  Its too early to tell for sure about the quality of the work, but the experience of having it done was certainly as painfree as could be expected and Ive had no problems so far.  I also appreciated the fact that he did not seem to be trying to upsell services as many dentists do. Users/DataPoint

20100722 03:50:28 nbsp I love the whole staff at his place. Theyre always very friendly and have lots of schwag to hand out. Ive been going here my whole life and even as a child going to the dentist was actually a TREAT, never something dreaded. Ive never had a cavity and Im sure I owe my healthy teeth at least in part to the great care Ive received. Users/KBathory

20110108 11:35:19 nbsp Dr. Phillips has basically been my dentist for my entire life (I vaguely remember a brief stint at Dr. Mollitars with a horse puppet involved for showing me how to brush my teeth...or maybe that was a dream? XD). Ive had sensitive teeth for a long time but I have never had any problems. I also have fairly chronic TMJ disorder, which makes it hard to keep my mouth widely open for long periods of time, and they are always very accommodating about this. Im pretty certain it is due to Dr. Phillips lecturing me (kindly) on dental hygiene as a kid which has instilled in me a lifelong aversion to fuzzy teeth. The result: Ive never had a cavity :)  Users/Anja
