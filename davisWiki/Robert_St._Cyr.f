Fantastical mustachioedmanager of the Bike Barn. Knows everything about bikes and their illustrious history. Stop by the Bike Barn to meet the legend, or take a class through the Experimental College on bike maintenance or wheel building.

His interests include solitaire, spidersolitaire, and a more recent majhong. But dont let his mustache fool you as he is a wellversed master of mechanics. Having served in the military prior to his experiences in Davis, he has quite a few stories to tell.

A favorite band of his to listen to is the White Stripes as can often be heard emanating from the office where he does his work.
