Hi, my name is Robin.  Im a graduate of the Orphan Kitten Project. I like to walk on Users/TomGarberson sleeping people and nap in the sunshine.  I hate kittens.  I know, I know, everyone thinks theyre cute.  Im convinced its all a clever ploy, though.  Theyre plotting something.  Someday youll see... but by then, itll be too late.  Thats why I hiss whenever I see them.  I know the name isnt very masculine, but I have a longlost brother (also an OKP grad) named Batman.  So... yeah.  Not my fault.

My mom is a vet student, and every now and then she hauls me in to the VMTH.  Its horrible.  They shave my tummy and take ultrasounds and do other horrible stuff, just for fun!  And then my tummy is bald, and it gets cold and makes me snuggle up in blankets or on laps.  I have a difficult life.
