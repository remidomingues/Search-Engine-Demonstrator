20070730 21:10:11 nbsp Hey Robin, try logging out and then in again (on the wiki:wikispot hub or on Davis Wiki). Users/PhilipNeustrom

20070730 21:26:25 nbsp What browser and OS are you using? Users/PhilipNeustrom

20070730 23:32:26 nbsp Are you logged in when you visit other wikis like wiki:sf?  How about a wiki with its own domain name, like wiki:santacruz?

I havent heard of anybody else having this particular issue.  It sounds like it might be an issue with our new secure login system.  Why youd be able to log into daviswiki.org, but not sacwiki.org, is what confuses me.  Youre able to log in here, right? (after clearing your cookies)?  And after you clear your cookies again, youre not able to log into sacwiki.org?

Feel free to email me (philipn at gmail dot com) if you want to speed up this conversation a bit. Users/PhilipNeustrom

20070918 13:39:37 nbsp As per the street pages; I can go either way, but my thought is that link redundancies are good and make it easier for people to find information. Say you are driving down J street and you see a cool looking restaurant and you want to find out its name...with street pages you can find out. Those are my thoughts, but Im not rooted in them.

20090223 00:44:41 nbsp Hi Robin, Grazia corrected me when I asked her about Samiras being at the Mishkas location. She (and a number of old time customers) have said that it was once behind the Mustard seed, though. Perhaps you are thinking of the store that Pat Baker had for Men. It was something like a branch of Samiras. I know that this branch was on second street (from an old sale sign we found when we were cleaning out earlier this week that referenced both second street locations at the 14th anniversary sale, which would put it at 1988). However, that store was very short lived and was not the main Samiras store. Thanks for your attention to detail. From the information I have from Grazia though, the correct original location was 222 D St. Users/StephanieStudebaker

20090826 08:42:14 nbsp Im not sure if its accurate to say West Village will become part of West Davis. West Village is on campus, its south of Russell Boulevard, and the only way to get to/from West Village will be via Hutchison Drive, which takes you to central campus.  Users/jsogul

20090915 14:31:43 nbsp Landscape architects page needs to be renamed to landscape designers, or something, but Im not sure how to do that. Landscape architects and designers arent the same thing. Hope you or someone can help. Users/DonShor

20090915 20:59:07 nbsp Hi Robin,
Landscape Design is better. Thanks for making the change. A landscape architect can practice landscape design, but a landscape designer cant practice landscape architecture.
There are only a couple of landscape architects in Davis. It is a professional certification that requires a degree, apprenticeship, and an exam. They sometimes do residential design, but the designs are usually quite detailed and involve hardscape, sprinklers, construction detail, etc.
There is no certification for landscape design; anyone can call himself or herself a landscape designer. There are quite a lot of landscape designers in town, and it is more likely that a homeowner will work with a designer than a landscape architect. So this name is more accurate and more useful.
