RoboChair 3.0 was created in 2008 in mid March

The recliner currently on RoboChair is what gives it the 3.0 instead of 1.0, because initialy we used a plastic school chair that was found by our schools dumpster.  RoboChair was still cool and all, but nowhere near its current cool factor.  Now to tell you the short story behind that recliner.  I had been wanting to put a reclining armchair on for a while and had looked around Davis many times looking for suitable abandoned chairs,and with little luck for about two and a half weeks.  However, on my way downtown to get some air for my bike, I rode by a recliner in someones pickup truck.  I stopped and looked at it for a second, and I just knew This is the chair Ive been looking for.  So I went to the front door and knocked, when I asked the guy, he said that I could have it but he said one more thing.  He said that he was going to take it to the dump that day!  I swear it blows your mind to find the exact thing you are looking for, when if I hadnt had a leaky inner tube that needed to be filled THAT DAY, I never would have gotten that chair.  The arent enough words to explain how well that chair fits the chassis!

It has two direct drive motors (chain driven), one for each of the two power wheels which are in the front. On the back are two casters to make it turnable. The joystick controller links to a programmed computer which interprets the joystick signal to send varying amounts of power (using Pulsewidth modulation or PWM control) to each motor allowing the control of speed and turning (the wheels dont turn, the robochair turns by having the power wheels spin at different speeds), although because of the limitations of the code and the motor controllers and to some degree the laws of physics it is a bit tricky to get it to turn while moving forward although it has been gotten working pretty well. It also took a bit of code trickery to get it to turn well if at all while going full speed (still tricky).

RoboChair Outreach
We at the Robotics Club are always looking for money, and any money that you can donate to the club helps us a great deal.  The annual FIRST Robotics Competition that we participate in every year, requires $6000 just for registration.  You can send us money by mailing it to the Davis High School and specifically the Citrus Circuits Robotics.  Thank You


Another similar chair managed to make http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8323997.stm international news when it was seized (and later auctioned off) when the... driver... was found to be drunk.  Dont drink and ... err ... sit.


20070120 20:38:39 nbsp How long does it smash for? And when it dies do the wheels lock? It looks frickin awesome. I love the duct tape, and the joystick Users/StevenDaubert

20070120 21:29:21 nbsp ooh thats on DHS campus, I love how the devil logo thing still has that hole from the meteor. Users/StevenDaubert

20070124 10:31:53 nbsp when the batteries get low it starts moving in jerks, but no they dont lock up.  It will usually run 15 minutes straight on a 18 amp hour battery, which weighs 13 lbs BTW Users/DevinCastellucci

If you can make me a fleet of these for some funness, that would be totally awesome.. ~Users/DavidPoole davepoole

20070224 20:39:06 nbsp o_o Thats pretty snazzy. I wonder if you need a liscense to drive it... Users/KokoSorensen

20070225 14:37:43 nbsp well it isnt street legal, but we will be working on that eventually.  Thankfully the cops dont really know what to make of it, so they gawk at it for a while then carry on. Users/DevinCastellucci

20070510 08:17:29 nbsp As long as your in a bike lane, or on a sidewalk in a non business district I think the wouldnt trip... Users/StevenDaubert

20070619 19:17:29 nbsp pretty much Users/DevinCastellucci

20070621 13:21:26 nbsp Anyone want to see a robocouch? or a cross country robo ride? solar panels would be nice too. Users/DavidPoole

20070621 13:52:50 nbsp FUCK YES Users/GeoffJohnson
  To which query?

20070811 12:24:17 nbsp nice Users/BaaaamBi

20080120 19:57:51 nbsp Have you seen http://www.armchaircruisers.com? Users/JasonAller

20080312 17:02:14 nbsp i spotted the chair today! Users/JackkiCox

20090401 16:54:53 nbsp Far classier than a similar project from the state of Ohio: http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29971638/ Users/TheAmazingLarry
