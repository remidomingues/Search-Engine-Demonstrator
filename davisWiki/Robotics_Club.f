The http://roboticsclub.ucdavis.edu/ Robotics Club at UC Davis was rebooted in 2010 after a long hiatus. The club is now actively participating in robotics competitions, welcoming new members, new ventures, and new leaders. There are currently over 100 members from a wide variety of majors, engineering and nonengineering alike. The club uses one of the portable building located behind the Physics building and will be equipped with workspaces and tools.


The clubs current competitions include:
The 2012 http://robogames.net/ Robogames: For which we have built two autonomous sumo robots (3kg weight class).
The club has been working to design an autonomous quadrotor (essentially a helicopter with four propellers) to communicate with a groundbased robot called http://iel.ucdavis.edu/projects/imobot/ iMobot being developed in the http://iel.ucdavis.edu/ Integration Engineering Lab, by club adviser Prof. Harry Cheng. There are several possible competitions in 2012 for our UAV.

Contact the webmaster to receive club communications and updates.

If you have heard of a robotics competition that you would love to participate in, or just want to build a really cool robot, the robotics club will get the word out and support you with the funds, project space, and parts you need.

Please use the email listed above to contact current officers.

The first general meeting will be held on October 15th in Portable 1 behind the Physics building at 5:00pm.
