Robotmedia is a national student film collective with chapters in Davis, XNew York, Seattle, Los Angeles, Austin and BerkeleyX. As of November 2006, the Davis branch of Robotmedia became the only active branch. During the school year, each chapter has a showcase once per quarter where they show the films from last quarter as well as decide on next quarters themes. Even if youre not into film making, the showcases are the place to be. Davis showcases are typically shown in 194 Chemistry but have been in 2205 Haring as well. Attendance is typically in the hundreds.

Robotmedia is unique in that its a film showcase without the same pretentious air that many associate with student films. Anyone, absolutely anyone, can submit absolutely anythingFootNote(People have been known to make movies about lego men jumping into vaginas. After the end of 2005, the showcase organizers have requested that submissions be five minutes or less, but you could probably get away with longer if you ask first.). This has led Robotmedia to be the point of some controversy. Some people were offended by a film poking fun at CalPIRG, others were offended by http://www.livejournal.com/community/microcinema_lod/8721.html different movies. For the Winter 2005 ASUCD Election, they showed a ASUCD Senate Senatecampaign music video about campus politics called F.U.C.K. the Senate, links to which can be found on the Friends Urging Campus Kindness page. Regardless, Robotmedia has and always will be a place for anyone to show a movie.  You might see some films you dont like, but youre also sure to see a few that kick ass.

The idea is for people to make movies based on one or both of the showcase themes, but fewer than half of the entries in any given showcase have anything to do with the themes. Themes for the next showcase are decided by the audience by a democratic process that involves yelling and cheering. Lenny VanBoven is often suggested as a theme.

Submissions must be five minutes in length or less, and accompanied by a release form which can be downloaded from the official web site. Questions regarding submissions should be directed to XUsers/AdamBurgett Adam BurgettX Users/AndrewCholerton.

Robotmedia Davis was started by UCD student Users/JoeConte Joe Conte and the first showcase was on October 16, 2002.
