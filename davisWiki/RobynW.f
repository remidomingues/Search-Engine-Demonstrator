20101213 10:00:07 nbsp Hey, when you get the final amount of donated food for 2010, the FARM Davis page would make for a neat featured page... it has loads of photos and highlights a really interesting and successful project.  It would be a great example of both sustainability and charity for a holiday featured page.  Users/JabberWokky

20101222 11:50:03 nbsp Hello JabberWokky we will have our final amount donated on Monday. Ill email you with the number would love to be a featured page. Were just below 600 lbs, but should get there by Monday.

Do you know about the Events Board?  You might get more eyes on the work parties and other events if you post them to the board.  Plus then the Farm Davis Page will look less cluttered because you could just have a small section or no section on upcoming events.
