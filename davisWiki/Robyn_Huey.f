 Candidate Statement 

Hello, friends!

My name is Robyn Huey, and I am running for ASUCD Senate with the SMART slate. I am a third year Landscape Architecture Major and Community and Regional Development Minor from San Francisco, California with a passion for serving the UC Davis community.

I am the current Community Mentorship Advocacy Coordinator of BRIDGE: Pilipino/a Outreach and Retention Program Bridge: Pilipino/a Outreach & Retention at the Student Recruitment and Retention Center (SRRC). Since my first year at UC Davis, I have been involved in multiple organizations such as Mga Kapatid (MK), Filipino/a Association for Health Careers (FAHC), Filipino/as in Liberal Arts & Humanities (FILAH), Pilipino/a Americans in Science & Engineering (PASE), and the American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA).

My involvement ranges from serving as a board member of Mga Kapatid, a coordinator for Filipino/a Graduation (FilGrad), a mentor for Asian Pacific Islander Leadership Retreat (APILR), a CoEditorinChief of The SEA Pages and a coordinator for Rise Up!, a UC Davis campaign for Typhoon Haiyan Relief Efforts. Additionally, I have served as an intern for ASUCD Senator Alyson Noele Sagala Alyson Sagala.

I am running on the SMART Slate: Students Matter: Activism, Retention, Teamwork because it embodies my passion for social justice and educational equity.

My inspiration for serving as an ASUCD Senator comes from being heavily active in the community, from being mentored by former ASUCD members to learning approaches in environmental sustainability through my education as a Landscape Architecture major. Throughout my time at UC Davis, I have worked towards the best interests of students, and I will continue to serve and advocate for our communities as your ASUCD Senator.

If elected, I will:

EXPAND Project Compost COMPOSTING ON CAMPUS

In recent years, UC Davis diverted around 67% of waste from landfill facilities. However, more can be done to expand composting and contribute to the Sustainable 2nd Century mission of making our campus zero waste by 2020. Compost bins exist at various locations around campus, yet they are not available in bathrooms where a majority of the waste is compostable paper towels. The bins already exist; all that is required are compostable bags. Existing facilities on campus are capable of being revamped to help divert more waste from landfills. Letâ€™s increase campus sustainability!

FOSTER ACADEMIC MENTORSHIP PROGRAMS

Graduating in four years is ideal considering how expensive a college education is these days. However, only 58% of students who entered the university in 2009 graduated in four years. Academic mentorship programs can help increase fouryear graduation rates by providing a peertopeer support system that aids students in determining their major or path to graduation. With the collaboration of ASUCD, student life centers and student organizations, I will create a resource guide to better publicize the many mentorship programs organized by students at UC Davis. Through this project, I will address student needs where they are most critical and create greater efficiencies within the systems already in place. Together, we can work to increase graduation rates at UC Davis!

Vote ROBYN HUEY #1, SMART #25, and Armando Figueroa FIGUEROA/Maxwell Kappes KAPPES for ASUCD EXEC.
