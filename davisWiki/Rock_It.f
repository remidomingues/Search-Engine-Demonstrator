Rock It is a dance event that happens at The Grad on select Sunday nights. DJ Boy Wonder plays mostly Indie dance music for this event. Set lists can be found on the Rock It myspace page above.

You may know it by its flyers for their distinct hand drawn look, featuring kids who look a little Indie, and models who closely resemble real persons living in Davis.
