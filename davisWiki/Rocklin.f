Rocklin is a suburban town located about an hour east of Davis along Interstate 80. Rocklin has grown tremendously over the past 10 years. It is home to Sierra College, which is known for its attractive campus and nature trails. A number of Sierra College students end up transferring to UC Davis.

Rocklin doesnt have much in terms of largescale shopping.  This is mostly due to its residents complaints of adding traffic or changing the dynamic of the community.  To most of the teenage population and rational adults, the traffic complaint is idiotic because all the businesses that are rejected in Rocklin, set up in Roseville.  They are typically found very close to if not on the dividing line between Rocklin and Roseville.  The most well known being the Roseville Galleria.
