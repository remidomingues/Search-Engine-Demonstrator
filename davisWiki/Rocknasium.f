The Rocknasium is an indoor rock Climbing climbing gym and proshop with rock climbing gear.

Rocknasium is Davis own local indoor rock climbing gym and proshop. Established in 1992 Rocknasium is one of the oldest indoor climbing gyms in the country. Serving Davis, Sacramento, and surrounding areas for over 20 years, they are proud to bring you awesome climbing, bouldering, fitness, yoga and more! As a small business, they offer a true mom & pop feel to the gym, and provide a great space for the climbing community to train, have fun, and hang out with friends.

In 2012 Rocknasium celebrated their 20th anniversary by building an entirely new gym just a couple of doors down from the original space. It is now bigger, better, steeper and more modern with over 5000+ square feet of climbing. There are more topropes and more leading, PLUS a 16 foot tall overhanging bouldering wall. There is still a great proshop as well as weightlifting & cardio equipment, but now theyve added a dedicated yoga room, a nice hot shower (with towel service) and full climatecontrol with both heat and airconditioning!

Everyone is welcome (ages 614) and no previous climbing experience is necessary. Adventure seeking kids will learn selfconfidence, coordination and camaraderie through the thrill and challenge of rock climbing.  Don’t forget to bring your imagination!

Camps run weekly with our first week of camp starting on June 16th and our last week ending on August 22nd. You can sign up for as little as 1 to as many as 10 weeks of indoor climbing camps. Camps are typically 4 days per week, and most of them run Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday (skipping Thursday).

Each day’s session is 3 hours long AND we host two different sessions each week:  A morning session from 9am to 12pm and an afternoon session from 1pm to 4pm.
You can sign up for either OR both!  (Signing up for both daily sessions counts as 2 weeks.)

20090404 20:10:03 nbsp I was looking for something to do with my 4.5 year old daughter, I proposed Rocknasium and she was quite excited after I explained.  The staff was extremely friendly, helped her into a body harness, and quickly reviewed my knots and belay technique.  I sent her to the counter because her shoes were too big, and she came back very pleased with her new shoes.  After 3 attempts she made it to the top of the easiest wall after gaining some confidence from watching an 8 year old get to the top.  One of the staff gave her a high 5 and congratulated her.  A birthday arrived as we were leaving and they gave us a sticker and tattoo (which she is now proudly wearing).  I asked her about her favorite part and she mentioned ringing the bell.  I asked her how it felt and after some thought she said it made her feel proud.  So all in all it was a cheap ($5 for under 5 year olds + $3 for equipment) and fun afternoon made better by a friendly staff. Users/BillBroadley

20120616 14:54:05 nbsp oh man new and improved rocknasium? Im going to have to stop by Users/StevenDaubert

20120616 21:56:31 nbsp After 18 years in Davis, I went to Rocknasium for the first time for a birthday party tonight. It was a blast, and Im seriously considering adding it into my regular exercise routine. I have always known about it and have seen the Wednesday farmers market portable wall, but I guess I never really thought of it as a serious place for a great workout. Well, Im sure tomorrow morning my body will remind me of the great workout (and time) I had tonight at Rocknasium. Fun and exercise for all abilities and ages. Users/ScottLay

20120730 08:41:18 nbsp This is a really great place to climb.  The staff are always super helpful and nice, the routes are well designed with accurate challenge ratings. Users/DagonJones
