Name:  RocksandDirt

I dont usually use real names on the internet, due a slight case of identiy paranoia (and a wee bit of identity theft probs).

Im a geologist working for Yolo County these days.

Not really my picture, but one of Paulina Borghese  Napoleans sister, whose marble portrait is one of the masterpieces of Western art.

20070316 10:25:03 nbsp I would love to get togehter with you for a coffee sometime and learn a little about Yolo County Geology, if you are up for it.  Im buying of course. Users/DavidGrundler  That can be arragned....email rocksanddirt@yahoo.com  maybe I can come up with a field trip idea or something if others are interested as well....

20070316 12:01:04 nbsp I might be interested in a field trip too. I wrote the Geology page based on the http://www.consrv.ca.gov/CGS/information/publications/cgs_notes/note_17/note_17.pdf Generalized Geological Map of California. I had heard that Davis was more clayey and Woodland was more sandy but looking at the Yolo County maps I could see both in both areas and I decided I didnt know enough to make a conclusion, so if you could add something, it would be nice. Thanks. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20070316 13:02:25 nbsp Good point. I knew they were not in Yolo County, (I actually thought they were in Colusa County until I looked it up), but it was the sort of thing where I wrote the first half of the sentence, went and looked up some information, then wrote the second half without really connecting them. So thanks. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20070329 15:09:23 nbsp Thanks for adding to Geology. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20070619 19:15:00 nbsp Yo, how about you add a picture of the catapult you wrer talking about to the hurlers page! Users/DevinCastellucci

20071030 21:54:32 nbsp Thanks for your comment on the Recovering From Spiritual Abuse Page.  Interesting thought on atheism.  If people really knew Jesus theyd be totally attracted.  Hed probably be walking into bars and telling the best jokes!  :) Users/RichLindvall

20080202 22:49:44 nbsp If you guys are going to discuss surface materials, better to consult a soil survey than geologic map. Furthermore, the geology is pretty darn bland. More interesting to talk about depositional history of Putah Creek and the resulting soil distribution. Users/DylanBeaudette
