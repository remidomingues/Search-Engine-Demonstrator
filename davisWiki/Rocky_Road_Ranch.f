20070729 15:28:18 nbsp Ive boarded my horse here through all of grad school  its a great, small, lowkey place where you can do whatever style of riding you want.  There are retired horses who never get ridden as well as jumpers and dressage horses who are ridden often and show regularly.  There are jumps available in the outdoor arena, while the indoor is mainly for flatwork.  Horses are fed twice daily, cleaned once daily, and turned out 34 times/week if its not wet/rainy.  Everyone who boards here is really nice and friendly, and Carol and Ted keep everything safe and comfortable for horses and riders. Users/rachelss

20120428 19:58:37 nbsp I have been boarding at Rocky Road Ranch for almost a year now and cannot say enough good things about it!  After having boarded at many of the barns in the area, Rocky Road is definitely the best for my horse and I!  Carol and Ted do an amazing job of keeping up the place and so I dont have to worry about my horse when I leave town or cant get out there everyday.  All the boarders are really friendly and look out for one another.  I love that my horse has individual turnout several days a week, a covered arena and MILES of trails to ride.  They also have a new website.  http://www.rckyrdrnch.com/ Users/RoxB
