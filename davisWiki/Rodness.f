Welcome to the Davis Wiki!  It is strongly encouraged that business owners read the Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner page to understand the philosophy behind the Davis Wiki and how it is used by the community at large.  In particular it provides valuable insight into what business owners can expect when interacting with the wiki system.

Welcome to the Wiki Howdy, Steve, and Welcome to the Wiki!   You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, so we know who were talking to (unless you go by just Rodness in casual conversation).  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  You did some recent edits to Rodness Martial Arts Center that were reversed as they removed some community review and comments. As Wes points out above, you might want to read the Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner wiki guide for business owners to get a feel for what might be more constructive in the future. Please read it, and please stick around: many businesses have found that the wiki can provide them a great service by connecting them to the already existing community.   Also, dont forget that youre a member of the community too... so feel free to tell us about yourself, and add to the Front Page rest of the wiki as well! Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
