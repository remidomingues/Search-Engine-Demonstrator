I spent over 15 years living in/around Davis and going to school here, so I have a bit of knowledge that the younger kids may have never known, but I might as well kick in my 2 cents here and there. and be one of those In my day... sort of people. Graduated in 2003 with a degree in UC Davis Geology Department Geology, after 11 years of on again off again attendance at UCD. Yes, you can change from an Electrical and Computer Engineering Electrical Engineering major 5 years in, in fact, they are quite happy to help you leave so someone who really wants to be there can get in.

While I am a Native Californian, and I have spent over half my life here. Chicago will always be my hometown since I spent my formative (ages 717) years there. I tend to identify with people from the Davis Midwest Connection midwest by where I grew up.

And apparently, I have a completist fetish for Chicago Style Pizza info. Stems from being a Chicago boy and having to educate the unenlightened.  Texas style BBQ may be next... but that would my wifes territory.

Whenever I drive through Davis, I tend to navigate by what was there.  Since I have moved to Florida, I dont think I will be contributing all that much to the wiki any more (not that I was ever very prolific).

20051121 16:37:14 nbsp Youve been in Davis way longer than me, so hopefully you could elaborate on the UC Regents/Freeborn Hall incident of 1991.  Ive tried reading old newspaper articles via Lexius Nexus but I couldnt turn up much aside from oneparagraph stories saying that 200500 (I cant recall) students had stormed into Freeborn Hall and not allowed the Regents to meet in it.  I also remember reading that the Regents thought Davis was a safe place to meet due to little perceived political activity. Users/PhilipNeustrom

20061005 09:45:35 nbsp Are you sure Kamon in Davis isnt related to the Kamon restaurants in Sacramento? Koichi Mizushima started the Sac restaurants and spent several years making sushi in Davis before it was trendy, at one point purchasing Osaka Sushi.  Users/AlphaDog
