 Ro Jasavala 


Rohini likes The Simpsons.  Rohini might like your mom, so give her your moms phone number, just to be nice.

The Aggie once ran this picture of Rohini. Isnt she pretty?   the aggie changed the pages and now that image is gone, oh well

Im from Modesto, and I am lucky that I made it out without getting hooked on meth or being murdered. Every time I visit, Im constantly reminded how I should carry mace, or just not go home.

I was a Genetics major, and Im a sucker for guys who are in the Molecular and Cellular Biology MCB department.

I used to work in the Genome Center, far far away from the rest of campus.  I also was onefourth of The 230.

I was the owner of two wonderful rats, Splinter and April.


My Social Structures Davis life includes Livejournal LJ, Wikivangelists spreading the wiki word , and I hung around for a while as a Davis Groupies Davis Groupie.  Now, I live in West Sacramento.
