Davis is a neverending font of geekdom:


   DRAGON  Davis Roleplaying and Gaming Organizational Network.
   DRAGON is also host to two onsite LARP LiveAction Roleplay games.
   Droms Comics and Cards sells supplies and has tables to play at.
   Bizarro World sells geek supplies and offers space to play.
   Dungeons and Dragons is perhaps the most popular roleplaying game and is very easy to get into.
   White Wolf is a popular publisher of more story oriented games, several of which run in Davis.

And of course, with any geek activity, there is a certain fetish for the paraphernalia of the hobby, the most exalted of which is typically dice.
