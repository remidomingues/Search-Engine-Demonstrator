I have always been drawn to athletic skill and movement. For the past 13 years this passion has been in the Martial Arts (Wingchun and Escrima) as a student and an instructor. Some time ago, I injured my hip and decided to seek treatment with Rolfing®. That was how I met Advanced Rolfer Art Riggs. After my successful rehabilitation, I was so impressed with the results that I decided to study Rolfing myself. I continue to be amazed by in the bodys ability to heal and repattern itself. I look forward to merge my passion of movement, bodywork, learning, and holistic health to help people just like you.

Rolfing (aka Structural Integration) is a type of body manipulation that addresses recent and lifelong patterns of strain in the body and its connective tissues. Postural balance and functional use is restored through handson bodywork and gentle exercises. This is usually, but not always, done through a 10 session protocol. Injuries, trauma, and daily habits can cause the body to lose it’s  relationship to gravity. This could lead to pain, decreased range of motion, and lack of energy.
