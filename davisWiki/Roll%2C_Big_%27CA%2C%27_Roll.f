A Davis campus fight song written by alumnus and former Aggie Band Aggie Bandsman Greg Sweatt.  Probably composed in the late 1970s or early 1980s, its lyrics reference the mascots of some of the Northern California Athletic Conference opponents that the Aggies regularly faced until the conference dissolved in the 1990s, as well as Sac State. This is one of the Aggie songs.

{{{Here come the Aggies, here comes the band,
Spreading our colors over the land.
Because the Blue and Gold will carry the day,
Charging the Mustang into the fray.
Wipe out the Hornet, declaw the Cat,
Swallow the Gator, chop down the Jack.
Well fight for alma mater, body and soul
Were gonna roll, big CA, roll!}}}

The CA in the title is not the abbreviation of California but the acronym of California Aggies, as in the Oldschool Aggie Logo.
