Roller Hockey is a sport related to hockey and distinct from field hockey or indoor hockey.

Once upon a recent time, UC Davis had an outdoor roller hockey rink, complete with boards, glass, floodlights and electronic scoreboard!  Later on the rink was even outfitted with a smooth, nonabrasive skating surface.  http://imsports.ucdavis.edu IM roller hockey teams played at the La Rue Road rink, as did the UC Davis Roller Hockey clubs and other local teams.  Unfortunately, the rink fell victim to the constructionhappy school that is UC Davis; rink pieces were sold off (through the Bargain Barn), and the area was converted to a very well lit basketball court. Currently the Health and Wellness Center is under construction at this site.

 The DISC 
However, just around the same time, the DISC came into being.  The most specialized of the Davis fitness centers, the Davis Indoor Sports Center Davis Indoor Sports Center was a popular destination for roller hockey fanatics.  The DISC offered facilities for inline roller hockey, indoor soccer, and other sports, and offered childrens and adult leagues, lessons, and playing time for local leagues, UCD Roller Hockey clubs, and UCD IM games.

Speaking of IM roller hockey, well, it too was another casuality of costs and reloction.  With the move to the DISC, team entry fees became exorbitant, deterring most casual players and dwindled participation to zero.
