20140314 11:55:03 nbsp Wait, youve been appointed controller? Users/MilesThomas

20140314 19:52:16 nbsp I dont remember making him controller.  In fact, I dont event remember giving him an interview.
I havent given interviews yet though, so all I can say is Im fairly confused by this whole thing. Users/MaxwellKappes

20140318 13:16:35 nbsp I wouldnt recommend deleting my comments.  You invited this by editting your Daviswiki to say you were controller before a hiring process had begun. Users/MaxwellKappes

20140318 20:02:00 nbsp Totally accidental edit, was trying to put other things on this page. Sorry for the confusion though Users/RomanRivilis

20140331 18:28:19 nbsp I still dont understand how you can accidentally do all that research, type it up, and post it. Users/MaxwellKappes

20140331 19:30:52 nbsp You already know how much of a DavisWiki nerd I am, Max...

Seriously though, I have multiple dumb history blurbs like that, theyre only kept and posted if they ever happen for whatever reason. None of that is accidental, its just shit I do when Im bored. I was trying to do other edits when that one got accidentally put on my page, hence why I yanked it right away. I really do apologize for any confusion that may have caused you. Users/RomanRivilis
