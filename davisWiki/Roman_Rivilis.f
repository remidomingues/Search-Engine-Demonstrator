 Candidate Statement 

Hello Aggies!

My name is Roman Rivilis, and I am a secondyear Political Science major from the Bay Area. I want to adapt the association to serve the students more closely. I plan to foster the involvement and opportunities of the student body, in order to further enrich the educational experiences of Davis students as well as sustain the budget needed to support these students.


EXPERIENCE:
 Intern to Senator Justin Goss
 Internal Affairs Commissioner
 Lobby Corps Intern
 Entertainment Council Volunteer
 KDVS Volunteer

IMPROVE BUSINESS INFRASTRUCTURE
ASUCDs budget has been dwindling as of late. Funding primarily goes to units which derive from student fees, but theres no financial mechanism that can effectively accommodate both the ASUCD budget and student fees. Students already have a difficult time affording textbooks, and with the absence of US Bank from the campus, the need of a reliable business unit has escalated. By working with Brett Burns, the ASUCD Business Manager, and contacting the Student Alumni Association, I plan to institutionalize a student and alumni credit union that engages in microcrediting practices, allowing students to withdraw loans to purchase textbooks at low interest rates.  ASUCDâ€™s budget can gradually grow in the long run, and students will have financial relief and management experience in the short run.

CONNECT FACULTY TO STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS
There are over 1800 faculty members on campus and 25,000 students; this number continues to grow, fostering the need for student organizations throughout UC Davis. There are a diverse range of clubs and organizations on campus, all of which offer great chances for students to get involved, but many of these clubs lack consistent means to communicate with members of faculty willing to support their organization. By collaborating with faculty advisors and ASUCD Outreach Assembly, I plan to organize a sponsorship program that connects members of the faculty with clubs and student organizations. Students will be able to build rapport with faculty and gain valuable internship, networking, and even research opportunities among other advantages by directly networking instructors and other staff with students on campus.

RESTORE THE AS PAPERS AS AN ONLINE UNIT
With the passage of the 20/20 Initiative looming over, thousands of students will be expected to pour into the campus over time, increasing the need of oncampus representation and expression. AS Papers, a unit last seen in 2011, provided this representation by comprising over a dozen different publications at the behest of the student body. Unfortunately, misuse of the AS Papers office by the student body rendered a unit an oncampus computer lab, which diminished its use over time until the unit was closed. I plan to collaborate with Alex Park, the Creative Media director, to reinstate AS Papers into an ASUCDsponsored website that allows for the circulation of numerous campus editorials, increasing the input of opinions presented by the student body and fostering the involvement of a gradual influx of students.
