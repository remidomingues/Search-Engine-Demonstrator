History
Rominger West winemaker Mark West had worked in Napa for a number of years when he met Charlie Rominger, a local farmer with Rominger Brother Farms who was growing grapes for wineries in Napa. Mark felt that Charlie’s grapes were of such a high quality that they needed make a plan to produce their own wine together. They decided to pick a site, grow grapes and create a delectable wine from Yolo County. Rominger West was born. Charlie Rominger and Mark West both grew up in Yolo County and their winery remains true to their roots. Rominger West focuses on sustainable farming and local conservation and reuse of resources to support and encourage the economic viability of rural Yolo County land and farmers. Rominger West wines are handcrafted with as little machine interference as possible to produce wines that have been gently cultivated and nurtured throughout the Viticulture and Enology winemaking process.

Today Rominger West Winery is growing in Yolo County, becoming more and more involved in the community, supporting local organizations and encouraging sustainable agriculture. With the 2011 harvest finished, they are looking forward to bottling new wines over the next few months and are eager to share more and grow with the community.

20090916 15:37:47 nbsp I have personally never been to this place, and although I like wine, I am turned off of going here simply because of the fact that they are taking over the events  board in this Wiki with all their advertisements. I feel like the events board is a space for community events and not one that private businesses should use for free advertisement. Since most of  the events are recurring, I think that a more appropriate place for these postings might be the regular events page.  Users/mydiaz
  While they may have gone a bit overboard recently, they are hardly the worst offenders. I have personally encouraged them, and many other organizations, to post their events on the Events Board. They have many oneoff events, such as the one I attended yesterday (20091011). Among corporate/businesses, they are one of the best. Their whole existance is based around sustainable agriculture, plus they have been generous in giving back to the Davis community. Lets not criticize them for what is really a DavisWiki events board policy matter. Users/SteveDavison

20091014 10:26:20 nbsp What a wonderful surprise! I just happened to stop in this weekend after checking out the new Target (its across the street) and it was lovely! They were having a Fall Festival with live jazz, free tastings and there were even local vendors selling crafts and gormet treats.  I was truely impressed with their wines as well (try the Chapman Hill Syrah...its delish!)! I fully plan on returning sometime soon...they mentioned something about specials on Thursday evenings. Users/pattom

20091026 14:24:16 nbsp We just held my husbands 50th birthday party here, and I highly recommend this as an event site.  They bent over backwards to meet our needs.  We had abut 70 guests, about 20 of which were small children.  Rominger provided an area for the kids to play (with supervision).  The kids were able to draw with chalk on the floor and play other games, while the adults sampled wine and had real food and conversations.  It was a perfect venue for this.   Users/JenniferHolman

20091106 13:31:48 nbsp Please do post your calendars on your website, and do include quick links to them from this page (theyre hard to find on your website). If you want to put them on this page, I dont have an objection either. I dont think its a good idea for them to be published on the events_board though. Lets keep the events_board for oneoff events, either single day or multiday, but not monthlong general calendars. Do keep posting special events there though. I hope you consider this a polite request. Users/SteveDavison

20100206 12:19:07 nbsp I finally went here recently and was pleasantly surprised by the tasty wines.  The music events look like they should be fun as well. Users/EdHenn

20100226 09:16:20 nbsp I went last night (with husband and son) to hear jazz singer Natalie Armstrong. The music was fantastic, and I hope her group comes back often! Acoustics and lighting for the singer and musicians were not great, but they are supreme performers. Oh yeah, I drank a glass of nice wine too. There were some munchies, but not quite enough. Im planning to go again, and I hope to encourage my friends to do so also. Users/NoelBruening

20100414 15:46:07 nbsp Rominger West is the best kept secret in Davis. We love Happy Thursdays the staff are all very nice and the wines are outstanding!  Users/RenewDenim

20100513 00:18:07 nbsp Rominger West does one thing right... They have great employees and great events.  The problem lies(sp) with the wine.  Before I go on, I really like this place.  The wine rates a D plus to a C minus.  The Reserves are OK but not worth the $40 plus a bottle.  Im sure they know this.  It is always a treat to attend events, just hope the wine improves.   Users/spook00

20100909 18:02:11 nbsp The customer service here is amazing. The hosts and hostesses are extremely considerate and helpful. The atmosphere is nice and it was fun listening to a live band (although the music is loud enough to inhibit talking with anyone). They have tasty snacks out at the tasting as well. The problem is really the wine. I only had a Syrah, so maybe the others are better, but the Syrah was very acidic although it did have a nice robust flavor if you ignored the acidity. I will come back to try the other wines, but I dont have high hopes. Users/RachelPeters

20101002 17:38:48 nbsp The atmosphere is great and the people are fantastic.  The wine was very nice, and really reasonably priced (much less than the $40/bottle an earlier reviewer noted  perhaps theyve altered their prices?).  We look forward to going back for the live music.  Weve been looking at the place for years as we drove by it, and were really glad we decided to actually stop in today! Users/S.O.S.

20111009 18:33:35 nbsp My son and I have attended many of the Thursday afternoon live music events at this Davis winery, and we are always pleased with the free appetizers, the live music, and the beverages. The last time I went, I asked what they had for my (10year old) son to drink. Immediately the proprietor went to the kitchen to fetch him a juice box, and she wouldnt let me pay for it. I gladly paid for my wine, which was rich and tasty. With the lush smell of wine, the delicious food and drink, the pleasant decor, the commitment to the Davis community, the excellent customer service, and (often) the live music, Rominger West Winery offers a welcome cultural experience. Highly recommended. Users/DrandyJones

20120427 09:31:19 nbsp Its closing? Thats awful! Anything we can do to reverse the situation? Users/Chamoudah
  I dont think so, unless you know someone who wants to buy the business.  Here is the Davis Enterprise article on the closing:  http://www.davisenterprise.com/localnews/agenvironment/nomorevintageyearsforromingerwestwinery/   Users/CovertProfessor
