20080613 13:33:55 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy, Ron, and Welcome to the Wiki!  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  You might want to check out the Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner tips for business owners.  Like everything else on the wiki, that guide was written by people like you and I, and its just guidelines with things that have worked well for people in the past.  Thanks for responding to the reviews in such a polite way, and once again, welcome to the wiki! Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20080613 10:52:16 nbsp Hey Ron... if you click Edit at the top of the entry, you can edit the whole thing (and that applies to everybody and every entry on the entire wiki).  You arent just limited to adding comments. Users/JabberWokky

20090527 12:29:27 nbsp The information you added to Davisville express lube would likely fit better in the actual entry rather than in the comments section.  Comments are usually reserved for reviews, suggestions, complaints and the like.  If a person were looking to see if your buisness offered tire sevice, they would read the article, and as that does not mention the service, they would move on. I know Im not inclined to read every review of a place that does not seem to offer the service I am looking for. Users/MasonMurray

20090829 16:25:55 nbsp Ron, the general practice on the wiki is not to remove comments, negative or postive.  You did a good job of replying to the negative comment, and Jabberwokky has marked the comment as suspicious. I think that anyone coming to the page can judge for themselves.  Personally, I immediately discredited the comment simply because it doesnt really make any sense. Users/CovertProfessor

20090830 09:53:24 nbsp Youve removed a quote from the Davisville Express Lube page a couple of times now. The quote is marked as questionable in nature, why do you feel the need to remove it? If it was left by someone with unscrupulous motives that has been noted so other readers can judge it in context for themselves, and if not then you are removing the contribution of another editor presumably because you disagree with what they say. Users/JasonAller
   I sent some emails back and forth with him before he removed it, and its probably my fault... I said that there were some valid reasons to remove it, and it would be a good idea to leave a reason for removing it up for a couple days to allow for discussion (a la the typical talk page process).  I think he saw my notice, thought that was sufficient and deleted it (although I dont think my notice was up for a couple days to prompt discussion, and it didnt really prompt for discussion).  I still think a driveby oneshot review that is clearly a slam and doesnt jibe with the other reviews should be removed.  If it were a glowing review that dropped hints that it was from the owner or an employee, the community would discuss and likely certainly nuke it.  Turnabout is fair play here, even if Ron has misunderstood how things work in terms of discussing edits with fellow editors.  Also, the fact that he emailed me first shows he started the process in a good faith effort to learn how things work. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20090902 10:57:15 nbsp Are you by any chance related to Tim Lautzenheiser of band directing fame? Users/jsogul

20090902 20:46:51 nbsp Well
 I am still learning about standard wiki practices.  I guess, when you work so very hard to run a good business you take these things personally. I was upset with the employee (more going on behind the scenes). Also Im a 757 Pilot for United (day job) and too much of a pefectionistgood pilot trait...maybe not so good as business owner.

I dont know Tim but we are probably related somehow. I hail from Ohio. There are many Lautzenheisers from the OH,Mich,IN area.

Thanks for all the help and advice.
Cheers
  Users/RonLautzenheiser

20090902 22:30:04 nbsp It appears that Tim is a faculty member at Ball State Univ. in Indiana. I didnt know there were lots of Lautzenheisers out there, that is interesting. Users/jsogul

20090903 09:47:07 nbsp Yea
The Lautzenheisers/Loutzenheisers stem from 2 brothers that emigrated from Germany around 1790. They came into the port of Philly. I actually found their arrival docs in the NY Public Library. Then went off into the OH, PA area.
Looks at Tims info via google...looks like a pretty accomplished guy. Users/RonLautzenheiser

20100217 09:52:15 nbsp Actually, Users/TomGarberson restored it first.  Users/hankim
