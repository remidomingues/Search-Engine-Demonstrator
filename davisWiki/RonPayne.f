20070306 14:26:04 nbsp Rather than just deleting that paragraph, you might do better to join the discussion about it at {{{Steve Ostrowski/Talk}}}.  Presenting an argument (or in this case, a supporting argument, since there are already other people against it) would likely be far more productive and likely to achieve results than simply being stubborn.

20070306 13:58:39 nbsp Ron, if you could call me, Id appreciate it.  Im not exactly a political enemy, as Ive been out of college for many many years, never attended any school in California, and I only care about trying to get things on this wiki moving smoothly and open communication lines.  Ive been calling Steve for the past day, and he has mentioned his cell battery was dead.  If you could let him know that Im still trying to talk to him, it would be appreciated.  Thank you.  615 5176900.   Evan Users/JabberWokky Edwards

20071010 21:01:23 nbsp Thats weird, Steve tells me his phone has been good all day.  I dont consider anyone an enemy.   Users/RonPayne

20071010 21:02:15 nbsp I just called him and he picked up.   Users/RonPayne

20071010 21:03:15 nbsp That comment was from some time ago, look at the edit history for the page. I just added the comment macro to the page while trying to figure out a comment to you. Users/JasonAller

20071010 21:03:46 nbsp Oh, I see. My bad.  Users/RonPayne

20071010 21:42:42 nbsp It would be in your best interest when drafting a serious document to not release an unreviewed and incomplete copy to the wiki. The {{{Eric Friedman Recall}}} is an example of how not to use the wiki. You cant collect signatures here so it doesnt make sense to create the page unless your desire is to make Eric look bad. All this will accomplish is to increase the level of negativity both surrounding ASUCD and on the wiki. Please dont. Users/JasonAller

20071010 21:46:04 nbsp Steve thought it was news and since he is about to give the final product to IAC within a few days he wanted some input.  But Senate candidates post their profiles but they cant collect signatures either.   Users/RonPayne

20071011 01:14:31 nbsp Hello Ronald. Two things. Firstly, Steven is banished from this community for a reason. I may disagree with banishment in general, because I am idealist and optimistic; however, he was banned for his own brand of asshattery^tm^ and in keeping with this, you are committing the same offense and thus should receive the same kind of treatment. That is to say, if you continue these actions, I will see to it that you are banished as well, though probably not on such a permanent basis as Steven was given a few warnings. Secondly, the page that we are disputing, it is wholly irrelevant to Davis, the community, and really any matter of ASUCD history, noting that Steve, yourself, and anyone else involved is simply earning the further dislike of the current members of the internal affairs commission as well as the ASUCD, so for the sake of your continued welcome in this and other communities, I suggest that you cease and desist these actions both on this website and additionally in the ASUCD. (I honestly care more about the former, you can make an ass of yourself there all you want). Users/DavidPoole

20071030 19:32:32 nbsp Either Ron is cloned or someone else is using Rons account.  I just spoke with Ron on campus, he was not using any computers. lol

20071030 19:37:39 nbsp I edited a portion of your comment because I felt it was deliberately trying to get around it by cheating, so to say (which doesnt usually rank high on American values).  I think other people would agree, but we can wait and see what the talkpage says.  I left a lengthy comment there, took me a few minutes to type it.  But maliciously trying to expose someone is against wiki history and norms, and I doubt people will let you do it to try to strongarm someone. Users/EdWins

20071105 21:49:56 nbsp Why are you asking me? Users/RonPayne

20071105 21:52:08 nbsp Because I want to know. Users/JasonAller

20071105 22:00:24 nbsp If I know something I will call the UCPD or DPD.   Users/RonPayne
  Wait, are you trying to say I was involved in this?  Users/RonPayne
   Wow, you are reading WAY TOO MUCH into my question. Users/JasonAller
   You are only asking me, on the whole wiki.   Users/RonPayne

20071106 06:27:52 nbsp I understand your passion regarding the USA entry, but constantly reverting is counterproductive.  Its like repeatedly screaming at a prospective romantic partner that they should go out with you.  If you have a good argument for keeping the entry long, make it.  USA says that they are interested in politics... but there are very few political concessions or proposals made by most members when theyve edited the wiki.  Youre dealing with a bunch of people.  If you have a good position, argue it.  If you examine the situation and honestly dont have a good argument against it, let the other edit go through.  I certainly dont agree with many of the edits that happen on the wiki, and I could probably strongarm them into place just by sheer persistence... and that applies to everybody else who is a regular editor.  However, there are some edits worth fighting for (by pleading your case), some that arent (so you grumble at the monitor and move on), and some where it simply isnt going to happen the way you envision it should.  Often in the third case you can examine the goals of all opposing arguments and come up with a new edit that satisfies everybodys intent.  Being social and conceding  even for a matter of hours, while you make your argument as to why an edit is wrong  gets you much farther than an antisocial tug o war on the revert button.

20071106 14:29:58 nbsp I dont see a whole lot of reverts on my part, maybe it was someone else.  Users/RonPayne

20071115 04:15:36 nbsp Slowly you are growing that case title into a coded transmission, arent you?  When it is Court Case 4243444751535457627174798288949596102114119126, the Red Horde attacks? Users/JabberWokky

20071116 14:27:14 nbsp What?  Andrew Kim didnt file to win an office?  ;)  Thanks for the catch. Users/JabberWokky

20071116 14:34:54 nbsp It seems kind of harsh to put the word fail on all of the loser pages.  Perhaps didnt win or lost.  You wouldnt say a School Board candidate failed to win a seat.  Users/RonPayne
  Actually, that is http://daviswiki.org/Bob_Schelen?actiondiff&version28&version17 exactly what I said. It is a pretty common phrasing referring to an attempt to gain office (well, a failed attempt to gain office), and the word failed doesnt imply anything other than that the attempt did not succeed.  Nor does the word gain in gain office mean that they are associated in any way with a http://www.gainlaundry.com/ laundry detergent.  Jimmy Carter failed to be elected in his second term.  Its not exactly outrageous or uncommon wording.   Users/JabberWokky

20071117 11:30:20 nbsp I just wanted to say thanks for keeping us updated on who Steve talks to and what he thinks about stuff.  Users/EdWins

20080614 08:27:15 nbsp Can you update the Gamma Alpha Upsilon page? If it never bloomed, just note that. Users/JasonAller
