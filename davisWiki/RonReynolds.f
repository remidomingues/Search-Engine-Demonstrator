Ron Reynolds

UC Davis class of 1994  B.S., Computer Science and Engineering

Finally had to leave Davis for Seattle WA in June, 2003 to work at Amazon.com. I really miss Davis, tho, or at least what it was in the early 90s before the building boom came crashing through.  

Go Aggs! (or whatever youre calling yourselves today  mustangs?  farmers?  cows?  talk about a school with an identity crisis...) :)
