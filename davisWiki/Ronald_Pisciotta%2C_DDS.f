20051113 12:52:07 nbsp I like Pisciotta, hes a pretty cool guy but you usually deal with the staff rather than you actually deal with him. Users/LizethCazares

20051210 10:07:51 nbsp I recently visited Dr. Pisciottas office for the first time.  He and his staff were very friendly, helpful, and thorough.  I will definitely continue my care with them. Users/AmandaSmith

20061219 11:08:34 nbsp Yeah, he is a nice guy, surrounded by a wall of incovenience.  Not possible to leave voicemail or email or any other way to cancel appointments... Dont call them at lunch Users/MichaelCase

20070719 10:08:08 nbsp The second greatest dentist in the known world.  The first is Steve Cavagnolo, but he has retired.  I dont know why Italians make such great dentists, but quello Ã¨ fortunato!  Also, he has dreamy eyes.   Users/HeywoodJablome

20070824 17:27:41 nbsp I went to see Dr. pisciotta after a not so good visit at Dr. Lins office. He was very nice and understanding, I think this dentist is a keeper.    Users/jess

20080118 10:41:38 nbsp I love Dr. Pisciotta. Hes awesome and does great work. Ive been going to the same practice since before Dr. Cavagnolo retired and I agree with the other comment heresad to hear Cavagnolo was retiring, but he couldnt have left his clients in better hands.  Users/KarenEmbry

20080513 20:23:09 nbsp I went to Pisciotta for many years but had to find another dentist because he does not control his staff very well.  Dont expect his staff to care about you even though you may be a longtime patient.  I tried to work out a minor Delta Dental billing problem with his staff and they acted like jerks.  Who needs that?  I recommend going to a dentists office where the dentist is in charge not rude staff people.    Users/jakedavis

20090317 13:09:25 nbsp Great experience with Dr. Pisciotta  hes friendly and kind, and seems to genuinely care about patient comfort. I had a cavity filled and he kept apologizing for any discomfort, but he must be pretty good because I didnt feel any. His staff is friendly as well, and Ive never had any problems getting in touch to confirm/change an appointment. Users/scottfischbein

20090616 11:42:15 nbsp Hes great, I had teeth pulled by him and I stayed awake for the entire procedure by choice (I could have fallen asleep if Id wanted to) because I was curious and he made the entire thing painless, even when the anesthetic was going in. Users/JacobMealy

20100129 10:33:01 nbsp Dr. Pisciotta took care of a cavity I had on my wisom tooth when I first moved back to Davis after graduating dental school.  I was impressed with the detailed anatomy that he carved into the filling. Detailed anatomy is not always clinically necissary but I always take the time to add this level of detail because it shows an appreciation for quality work and the art of dentistry.  I was very happy to see this level of dedication.  I have also seen the same detail on some of his patients at the community clinic (so it was not just a special treat he did for another dentist).  He is also nice guy. Users/DagonJones

20100609 13:37:37 nbsp  Ive gone to Pisciotta several times, and hes great, as is his staff.  Can take a LONG time to get appointments, so call ahead! Users/JohnW

20100916 21:23:21 nbsp I have had nothing but excellent service and experiences from Dr. Pisciotta and his staff. My husband and I have been going to him for 5 years, and my husband had several cavities filled and said he did an excellent job and it was pain free. Users/Barley123

20110328 22:08:28 nbsp My children and I have been seeing Dr. Pisciotta for almost 12 years now and I have only good things to say. My youngest has a hard time sitting still and is also very talkative, and the hygienists are always patient with her fidgeting and talking during the cleanings. I have some weird thing with my nerves which make it difficult to numb my molars, so I was really worried when first starting with a new dentist. He is fabulous! I swear he can read my face to see if Im having pain before I can even gesture or anything and he stops immediately. I just want to be clear, it is not that he is not numbing my mouth properly, its some weird thing with my nerves. The difference between Dr. Pisciotta and the other dentists Ive seen is that he is much more patient with having to stop and give me another shot and much more sensitive to the fact that I am still having pain. I do agree with the previous comments in that if you need to be seen at a specific time for a cleaning, you may have to wait a bit for an appointment, although after your first cleaning they just schedule you in advance for the next ones. However, anytime Ive had a toothache they have been able to fit me in the same day I call. I can not imagine having a better experience at a dentists office. Users/HilaryGarvin

20110711 11:17:41 nbsp I had been going to see Dr. Cavagnolo and for the past few years Pisciotta and everything was great. Then I tried to make an appointment in late June for a cleaning and to discuss a possible new development and was offered an appointment in late August. Two months? Something about a summer schedule, which I figure means either staff vacations or more people coming in with kids during the summer. They did offer to call me if there was an opening earlier, but alas, I have to go find a new dentist now. Users/m610

20121031 16:13:20 nbsp Ive been going to Dr. Pisciotta for several years and have found both him and his office to be professional and provide good care. He repaired a damaged crown for me and from a cosmetic point of view I was very pleased. Users/BethGoodstone

20131130 13:06:32 nbsp Dr. Ron has all of the stateoftheart equipment and skills to make and install a perfect crown in one visit.  After getting two crowns the old way, Ill never do that again.  Dr. Rons computercut crown fit perfectly the first time and looks and feels just like the old tooth.  Highly recommended. Users/JimStewart
