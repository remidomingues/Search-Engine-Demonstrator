Looking for a place to stay in from September 1  September 8 for $100

I have a temporary arrangement ending the 31st of August and a lease beginning on the eight or ninth of September, which is why I need a place from the 1st until the 8th.
Id prefer a room to myself, but because Im rarely even in the house during the day I pretty much just need a place to sleep and shower. I will be bringing with me about a backpack worth of stuff and a mattress if theres room, but room for the mattress isnt required.
No preferences besides it being clean (messy is fine) and no noticeable smells from smoking and such.
I dont smoke, drink, or anything like that. If you need to ask a few questions, I will be happy to respond.

☆ Room Available at The Arbors Apartments for the 201415 School Year! ☆

CONDITIONS:
Hello, my name is Rachel and Im looking for someone to occupy an 11x11 bedroom all to yourself at the toprated Arbors Apartments, PREFERABLY for a 12month lease, beginning on September 5th, 2014  though it is possible that you could just stay for a quarter. The cost is $660 per month. Your housemates would be two friendly secondyear girls (myself and a friend of mine). No smoking and no pets, please. I ask that you keep the apartment neat by promptly cleaning up after yourself and that you pay your rent on time every month. If you would like to find someone to share your room and rent with, Im open to that.

ABOUT THE APARTMENT:
The Arbors are a gated, peaceful place with lovely landscaping, a pool and spa, a fitness center, a laundry facility, and free parking. Located less than a mile away from campus, a 10minute bike ride will do  or if you take the bus, theres a bus stop is just up the street (M & W lines to the MU and SILO, respectively). InnOut, Whole Foods, and downtown are very close by! Our apartment is on the second story and has plenty of storage space, a kitchen equipped with a dishwasher, refrigerator, oven, and microwave, a living room with a balcony overlooking the pool, closets, 2 bedrooms, and 2 bathrooms. Water, sewer, and trash are paid for by The Arbors. We need to arrange and pay for gas and electric, phone, internet, and cable (probably can do without phone and cable). We will split the cost of utilities evenly among us.

Hi,

Im seeking a renter to share a 2bedroom 2bathroom 942 sq. ft. condo at the Wildhorse Condominiums on Moore Boulevard in North Davis. The complex is amongst the newest and nicest in Davis. The condo was built in 2006 and features luxurious and modern amenities such as granite countertops, contemporary appliances, washer & dryer, and pristinecondition fixtures and cabinetry. Enjoy upscale living at a convenient location! You will have a great view of Nugget Fields park, you will be within walking distance of the Nugget grocery store, and you will be next to an L Bus Line stop for easy access to the UC Davis campus. You will also be able to use the beautiful swimming pool in the common area of the complex.

The rent will be $750 per month for a yearlong lease beginning September 1st, 2014.
Utilities are not included, and will be split evenly between all tenants.
Your room is not furnished, but the rest of the condo is.

About me:
I am a 27 yearold male who is a UC Davis alumni, and I will be starting a graduate program in Electrical Engineering at UC Davis in the Fall Quarter. I will potentially be sharing the master bedroom and bathroom with a 24 yearold female who is also a UC Davis alumni, so there could be up to three people living in the condo. I will be on campus most of the time, and my roommate will be working full time, so you will have a lot of space, especially during the day.

About you:
You are either a UC Davis graduate student, a young professional (under 30), or a mature UC Davis undergraduate (over 21). If you are a foreign exchange student, you get bonus points (I studied abroad in Sweden for a year and loved every moment of it). You should be focused on your studies and/or your career. Having your friends over for some drinks is fine, but dont expect to throw any raging parties, especially during the week. It doesnt matter whether you are male or female, because you will have your own bedroom and bathroom, which also means you should have plenty of privacy. No smoking, please. No pets, unless you happen to own a labradoodle ;)

You can see pictures of the condo on this craigslist posting:

Hey guys! My name is Hannah, I am a 27 year old female who will be starting in the Microbiology doctorate program in the fall. I have a 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom house in Woodland, which is about a 1015 minute drive to UC Davis. I would prefer one roommate and keep the third room as a shared office space. I would also prefer a rooommate who is also in a graduate program. I am friendly and respectful of personal space/belongings. Im not interested in throwing crazy parties, but small gettogethers are fine. I do drink, so alcohol is fine, but nonsmokers, please. I do have a cat and I would not be opposed to adding another cat or small animal to the mix. No dogs, though.

The house itself is brandnew, located in a small subdivision. You would have your own bathroom and garage parking. There are washer/dryer hookups, but the appliances themselves will probably not be installed immediately. Rent would be $1000/month, which would include all utilities. I may be persuaded to fill the third room, in which case the rent would be reduced, but three people (including myself) is the most that I would like to live with. The room will be available in September after Labor Day weekend.

If you are interested, please contact me at 5093013047 or hannahstar44@gmail.com. I can also send you some pictures of the house.

We are looking for one more member to complete a 4 bedroom apartment at Adobe apartments in West Davis. My 2 roommates and I need one more person to fill the 4 bedroom apartment for this upcoming school year. The lease begins on September 1, 2014 and runs 12 months.

We are easy to get along with. We are not super clean, but we are also not super messy. We do not smoke, so we would prefer a non smoker.

Hello all

My name is Ann, grad student from Malaysia and I will be doing my research attachment at UC Davis (CADMS) from August till January 2015 (tentatively), so I will be in Davis for about 6 months tops. I need a room preferably close to campus (looking into buying a bike as well to get around so anywhere would be fine as long as it is within cycling distance). Female roommates only. I dont smoke and drink, so preferably no smokers (alcohol is fine though). Not a party animal but I can safely say I am quite fun to be with (and no, I am not your typical Malaysian). Prefer rent < $400. Quite a clean freak but I can tolerate occasional examrelated mess. I am quite an outdoorsy person, I play sports during my free time. A night owl. Hoping to get a private room + bathroom but I can share as long as it is comfortable for both me and the roommate.

For more details, email me at norarlina@gmail.com or whatsapp +60137141225. Thanks!

Open space: Spring 2014 and/or Summer 2014
Hi, my name is Coleen and Im going to study abroad starting Spring Quarter 2014. Im looking for someone to take over my room just for Spring Quarter and maybe Summer (preferably a girl, but anyone interested is welcome, as long as theyre studious, quiet, polite and clean up after themselves) in a 4 bedroom town house at Allegre Apartments (south davis). I currently live with 3 guys and 1 girl. You will get your own room upstairs and it will be furnished. I will leave my bed, (my mattress is very new, just got a new one over the summer and its completely odor free and stain free, which is why I prefer a girl, but youre welcome to use your own as long as youre ok with leaving my mattress on the side of the room) desk and dresser here since they are too heavy, but I will clear everything out (besides those 3) before you move in.

The apartment is great; it has its own washing machine and dryer, and my housemates are very polite, courteous and quiet. One is a graduate student, and the rest of us are all transfer students, but were all very studious and quiet and clean up after ourselves.

The location is very good. Its a 5 minute walk to safeway (24 hrs) and the buses M and W run along here and its less than a 10 minute bike ride from campus.

Below is the floorplan of the apartment and your bedroom will be bedroom 2:

Everything in the floorplan is exactly as it is in scale, except for the patio, spiral staircase, and balcony in the master bedroom (which we dont have). Theres only one balcony, and thats near the entrance.

The rent per month is $406.25, internet is $11 and utilities are about $1015 each.

If you are interested, please email me at coleenumali@gmail.com

As for the summer 2014 lease, I will talk to you more about it later in detail.

Thanks!

Hi everyone,

Im a visiting medical student from Michigan. Ill be in Davis from Feb 1 through March 6. I need a sublease in a comfortable, quiet residence for at least the month of February (and ideally the first week of March to cover all my days). Id like to rent my own private room, shared bath is OK but private is ideal. Friendly, respectful roommates preferred. Absolutely no smokers though! I will have a bike so being relatively close to campus would be great. Ill also have a car so hopefully parking is free if not really cheap. Lastly, Im allergic to cats (so no cats unfortunately) but OK with all other pets (HUGE dog lover).

As for me, Im a social guy who enjoys going out for a beer or two, but not looking to party or cause a ruckus. I especially appreciate peace and quiet especially after a long day on campus. Id be respectful of your space and property, and expect youd be of mine as well. Love to play some sports in my free time.

Please txt or call me if your sublease fits this description and youd think Id be a good fit! Thx for reading. Phone: (734)2337383 or email: christopher.chou@gmail.com

Need a place to move into fast? Looking for a house relatively close to campus?

Housemate Wanted Room available: January 1st 2014  August 31st 2014 (May extend lease if desired)

$500 for OWN room and shared bath in a 3bd / 2 bath house with garage at Pole Line Rd. and 8th Street. 1.5 miles or 8 minute bike ride from Campus. Has a UCD UNITRANS bus line across street directly to campus (Silo). Very close to grocery shopping. Other housemates are respectful, nonsmoking, Davis junior transfer and senior students, both male. We are Community Development and Engineering majors. We are friendly, social, and easy going guys looking for similar traits in a housemate.

There is no gender preference. Looking for someone who cleans up after themselves (this is important) and has no desire to throw house parties. Having friends over is fine but parties will not be allowed. Smoking of ANY kind must be done outside only. No pets, sorry. House is approx 1375 sq ft with a spacious floor plan. Also has a good sized fenced in backyard. There is a washer/dryer in the garage. Musician applicants are a plus but not necessary. On the weekends we may be practicing our instruments, (i.e. drums and electric guitar) unless its midterm or finals week. Other than occasional weekends it would be relatively quiet around the house. Its important to understand this as playing as a band once in a while does make significant noise. If your a musician, you would be welcome to jam with us.

The cost of internet and cable combined with ALL utilities will be split $75/person as a flat fee. This would not fluctuate at any point. This includes access to cable TV in your OWN room with included DVR box for recording your favorite TV shows. NO DEPOSIT needed to move in. You may move in EARLY anytime in December for no charge.

If interested call or text David at (602) 3128488 or you can email me at djdickson@ucdavis.edu. We are looking forward to meeting you.
Call/text to schedule to see the room and house. Thanks!
