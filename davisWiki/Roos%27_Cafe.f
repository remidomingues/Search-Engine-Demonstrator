It is grilled on yummy torta bread, it is a damn good sandwich with chips for about $6.  This is a really nice place for lunch considering they have a nice patio.  Also they have very good coffee, which is only $1 if you bring your own cup.  I was under impressed by the oatmeal cookie I had, coffee shops need chocolate chip cookies.  Edit:  a couple of months after this review a delicious chocolate chip cookie was delivered to my office (which is close by).  It was very tasty I am still dreaming of its deliciousness as I write this.  Also the Bahn Mi Vietnamese sandwich is great!Users/DagonJones
