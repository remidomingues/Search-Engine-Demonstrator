Root of Happiness is an alcoholfree bar that serves kava shots, kava mixed drinks, and kombucha. The bar is open to the 18andover crowd. The ambience is quite relaxing and reminiscent of the tropics, featuring a mural by artist Te Pou Huke, who was flown in from Easter Island just to create the piece. They also have board games like chess and Jenga!

If you are new to kava, Wednesdays are a good time to get introduced, because the bar offers three kava shots for $10. They also have a happy hour on most days from 47pm.

The Davis Root of Happiness opened in July 2014 after about a year of postponements. It is the second kava bar of the same name, the first of which can be found in Rancho Cordova.

What is Kava?
Kava is a shrub native to the Western Pacific Islands, prized for its root. The root is harvested, ground up, and traditionally prepared as a beverage in a halved coconut shell. The drink is of increasing popularity in the West due to its mild relaxing effects. Most users agree that kava does not affect mental clarity, making it markedly different than other recreational drugs like alcohol. However, it is not advisable to take kava along with alcohol as it can upset the stomach and increase drowsiness.  There is some evidence that Kava is hepatotoxic (causes liver damage).
