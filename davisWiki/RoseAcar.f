BannedGroup Banned due to continued spamming


20111215 13:19:49 nbsp Was she really spamming? The kind of link she added wasnt really helpful, but she might have meant well. Or was I missing something? I see that she added links to couponcabin to several pages on Daviswiki and Sacwiki. So maybe she works for them. But maybe shes also someone who just uses couponcabin, and thought other people might benefit from using it too? Still not a reason to put a link to couponcabin on the pages, but it would mean that she maybe shouldnt be banned? And her persistence in adding links to pages even after the links were removed might just be because she didnt know how to look at a pages history to see that her links had been removed for good reasons.

Maybe when the new Localwiki code is in place, and admins have access to user emails, we can email her to let her know that her particular edit wasnt in the spirit of Daviswiki/Sacwiki, but that shes invited to contribute in other ways. Users/NicholasBarry
 She doesnt mean well. She means to promote the website she was linking to and wants to abuse our decent pagerank. She is not a member of any local community (she is in Chicago). Even if she were, nobody who were sharing a link they found useful would do so in this manner. http://daviswiki.org/Siscast?actiondiff&version225&version124 This is how a normal person shares a useful link.

20111215 13:22:46 nbsp I did a find on that coupon website for Park Place and County Fair (the pages to which she added links, saying there were coupons there).  Neither one turned up.  I used the search feature there and it routed me to another coupon website which had nothing relevant.  Moreover, she appeared to be editing from Illinois.

Seemed like a spammer to me. Users/TomGarberson

20111215 13:28:47 nbsp I saw her posts, but actually didnt ban her until the details of her links came out.  Coupon sites are okayish, but they werent Davis or even California related.  Searches seem to jump to a retail site. Users/JabberWokky

20111215 17:09:14 nbsp Ah. All good information. Especially about her being in Chicago. If she were a Davisite or Sacramentan... Users/NicholasBarry
  Then she wouldnt have been banned without a ongoing history of abuse and a long, serious community discussion.  Only one person in Davis is banned, and only a handful of people have ever been banned in the many year history of the wiki, a couple upon their request due to personal issues. jw
