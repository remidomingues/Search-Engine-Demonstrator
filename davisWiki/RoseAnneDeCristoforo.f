Hi RoseAnne! Is your Gluten/Dairy Free page about Gluten & Dairy Free food? Or is it just a business? It looks like youre creating a page for Natural Food Works which we already have. You can list places to find and buy Gluten/Dairy Free foods, but it shouldnt be a page for one place. But great idea for the additions to the Food page, you making those pages really adds to the wiki! Thank you! Users/MichelleAccurso

Also, look into our style of markup at these pages:

Welcome to the wiki. Sorry to tramp through the first pages you created, Ive tried to preserve the information you contributed while moving it around to match the existing layout a little better. Users/JasonAller
