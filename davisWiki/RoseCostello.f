Hi Rose, and Welcome to the Wiki!  Im not sure which wiki youre actually viewing, so Im copying this in a couple of places.  It looks like you were trying to create a Davis Wiki page about Taize style services.  You created the page on the Gnome Wiki, though, and by changing a template page.  The template pages are there to provide a sample layout that can be copied over onto another page.  By changing the template page itself, that sample is lost.  Im guessing the page you wanted to make would be this: http://daviswiki.org/First_Friday_Taiz%C3%A9_Style_Service  you can click the link to bring up that page.  Youll see there that you can Create As (whatever).  Clicking one of those links will automatically load up the template (such as the Publication template you were using before) on the correct page.  That way you can go ahead and edit it, create that page on the Davis Wiki, and the template will still be available for others to use. Users/TomGarberson
