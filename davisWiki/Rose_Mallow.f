Rose Mallow (Lavatera trimestris) is a robust, fast growing shrub native to the Mediterranean and introduced to England in 1633. This beautiful member of the mallow family branches freely as it becomes covered with numerous, icewhite, pink or rose colored hibiscuslike blossoms measuring up to fourinches across. The plant accepts a variety of soil types and thrives in either full sun or partial shade. Listed as both annuals and tender perennials, Davis weather mild winters allow us to grow the perennial version without much effort and reward us with early garden color each spring.
