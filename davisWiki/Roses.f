Uses
Roses are not only beautiful; they hold their form well when used for hedging, and also provide theftdeterring thorns when planted around windows.  Rose hips (the bulbshaped growth directly under the flower) make excellent tea and are edible when cooked, as are the flower petals.  However, its not advisable that you go around munching on these plants: they may have been treated with toxic pesticides and herbicides.
