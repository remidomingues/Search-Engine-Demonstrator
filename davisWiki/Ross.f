Ross Dress for Less opened in Woodland 20051001. Ross is a discount clothing store similar to Marshalls and TJ Maxx. They sell overstock or slightly irregular brand name clothes at a heavy discount compared to full department store price. Next door to The Tractor Supply Co.



A Ross was originally going to be built in Davis years ago but was shut out by the Davis City Council for not being upscale enough, and the oft repeated fear that it would threaten downtown business.  There was a bit of an uproar about it since at the time there were few, if any, affordable clothing stores in town.  It was said at the time that you couldnt buy a pair of underwear in town.

Here is the inside story from a former Ross employee: The brand name clothes are cheap because the clothing that Ross sells is either overstock or slightly irregular. Ross gets cheap clothes that other retailers were not able to sell or items that are defective. Examples of the stores where the clothes have come from are Macys and Nordstrom. Many of the clothes on sale have been worn, tried on, and returned to the store over and over due to Ross lax return policy. The clothes are not cleaned prior to being put back on the racks. Please shower as soon as possible after trying on clothes at a Ross Store.

Ross does not actually have Sales in a traditional sense. In essence, they have an everyday low price policy. The prices are not lowered one week and then raised like at Macys. Items are at a set price and then go down the longer they sit on the clothing racks. So the price you see on the item is the highest price and it may ring up as less at the register.

Ross also offers housewares, dishes, pots, pans, utensils, chocolate, candies, fine jewelry, expensive perfumes at a heavy discount, designer sunglasses, books, lamps, chairs, toys, sports equipment, shoes, small electric devices, luggage, purses, and a limited selection of music and movies.

To get to Ross from Davis, take Yolobus 42A to E. Main at Matmor.
