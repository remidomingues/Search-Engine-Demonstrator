THE ROSSI CHALLENGE


MATERIALS

 One Jug of Carlos Rossi wine per team

  breads Bread  (it comes in handy)

GETTING STARTED

Divide up into teams of two, with one 4 liter jug of Rossi wine per team. The challenge is to finish the jug of Rossi first! You are disqualified if you throw up.

So far the record is at 27 minutes, set by Users/CyFoster Cy and Trena (who promptly threw up and passed out asfter finishing the bottle). This is controversial since throwing up technically disqualifies you.

Current Winners Users/LisaDavis Lisa and Users/JonDsouza Jon

Past Winners:

Users/BlairBaldwin and (teammate name needed) 01, 02 (needs verification)
Users/BrianMartinez and Users/PhilipNeustrom 03  Note: Phil and Brian were the winners by default that year. Every other team either formally withdrew or threw up (thereby disqualifying them). Brian and Phil never actually finished their bottle but could just as well have waited till the next day to finish.
Users/LisaDavis Lisa and Users/JonDsouza Jon 04
Users/BlairBaldwin and (teammate name needed) 05 (needs verification)  Note: controversial since the 05 match was held in a city other than Davis.
