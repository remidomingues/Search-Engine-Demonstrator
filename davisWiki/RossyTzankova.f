20060610 14:44 Welcome to the Wiki. Adding a comment in the comment box when making an http://daviswiki.org/Homeless_Resources?actiondiff&date1149972751 edit that removes content is a good idea to help others understand why the edit was made. I can guess several reasons for removing that picture, but adding a comment would make it less likely that someone would revert your edit. Users/JasonAller

20060611 00:40:08 nbsp Thanks. I considered adding a comment but I wanted to avoid the kind of argument that often seems to devolve into an irrelevant battle of wits and mutual comparisons of transcripts, degrees and dictionaries. I felt like such an argument might be even more offensive than the original picture itself. Users/RossyTzankova
