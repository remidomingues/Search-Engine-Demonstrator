Rotary is an association of business people, and they encourage ethics in business.  One of the more common trademarks of Rotary is the Four Way Test, a list of questions that promote ethical business practices:

  Is it the TRUTH?
  Is it FAIR to all concerned?
  Will it build GOODWILL and BETTER FRIENDSHIPS?
  Will it be BENEFICIAL to all concerned?
