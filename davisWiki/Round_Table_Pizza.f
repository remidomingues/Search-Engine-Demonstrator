Round Table Pizza is a pizza chain located in the northeast corner of Oakshade Town Center, just off of Pole Line Road. It offers dinein, carryout, and delivery.

Once upon a time, Round Table was downtown, where Kathmandu Kitchen is now. It went out of business, remained in restaurant heaven for quite some time, and then finally reemerged in the Davis food scene when Oakshade was developed.

20051111 17:36:06 nbsp I used to work at this one, and I can say they run a very clean and professional bussiness. Far better than other round tables I have seen/worked at.  Users/AlexGourley

20060617 21:29:23 nbsp Kathmandu Kitchen used to be a Mountain Mikes not a Round Table Users/SeanSmith
  Before it was a Mountian Mikes I remember it being a Round Table.  Users/JasonAller

20060722 16:42:29 nbsp Back in the Bay Area, they have ExtraLarge, but here, large is the biggest. Its still really tasty, but when I order from a Round Table, I desire XL!  Users/SamWard

20060913 15:25:19 nbsp Maui Zaui is my favorite! Users/RachelCakes

20070215 11:41:30 nbsp Ive had troubles lately in the evening, sometimes if you get there during the 9 Oclock hour theyll refuse to serve you, claiming theyre already closed. I submitted a comment to the website and got a prompt and friendly reply from the manager stating that their policy is not to stop taking orders until theyre really closed and that doing so is actually grounds for termination. I expect things will be better given his attitude towards the problem. Great pizza, btw. Users/ThomasPomroy

20070528 11:17:59 nbsp The round table in Woodland has been advertising a lunch buffet, but the one here in Davis doesnt seem to offer that choice. Users/AlexPomeranz

20070719 18:39:38 nbsp Very good pizza over the years since childhood i have come to love this pizza , of course i like other places but round table is a good pepperoni pizza anyone want to go let me know Users/dickjones

20070803 14:39:55 nbsp Great pizza always eat there about 4 times a year i like it very much clean store good employees great pizza always the same that is what i like about this joint! Users/Brians

20080128 23:26:02 nbsp Round Table has the Big Vinnie special ($12.99best deal) which I believe is their largest pie.  Ive had the Big Vinnie Pepperoni many times.  Ask for extra sauce because it tends to be rather dry otherwise.   Users/CurlyGirl26

20080827 12:36:32 nbsp The selection for the buffet usually consists of two or three pizzas, along with a platter of fleeting garlic twists. You need to get to the food fast, though, because youll have to do battle with a thousand screaming children in order to get any food on you plate. The kitchen seems to be regularly swamped and cannot put out new pizza anywhere near as fast as people take it. Users/JoePomidor

20080921 03:24:47 nbsp everytime i go there, it feels empty... and the salad bar looks like its been open for ages. Users/2point0student



20081016 22:07:35 nbsp The combination of painintheass customers and incompetent employees is hell.  Users/RJBTDP

20081120 11:49:30 nbsp Round Table has the best pizza buffet I have ever been to. The pizza is always fresh and the salad bar is to die for. I appreciate the excellent service as most places in Davis have forgotten how to give good service. Users/jefcar

20090304 14:30:04 nbsp Definitely amazing pizza and fresh goodness. ALWAYS come to the lunch or dinner buffet or have a coupon..cause its pretty overprixed. All you can eat slad for $5.50!? what the...and 6 garlic twists for $7.10?! yeah..Hunt down coupons or hit during the times they have buffets. YUMo. I was slightly sad when I asked one of the workers about what a Big Vinnie was..and they have no idea. _. Oh well, this place is right across from me though :D  Users/MissAmyQ

20090515 20:08:03 nbsp i love round table. its my favorite pizza chain.. BUT: 1. they keep undercooking their pizzas. 2. the last time I dined in, I was standing at the register waiting to order, but the girl picked up a brook and started sweeping, watched her sweep for a while before she took my order.. so annoying. 3.Then, I watched them leave my pizza on the counter for 10 minutes before bringing it to us. The guy there was about to bring it over to us, but he changed his mind and took other peoples order instead.  Users/julpham

20090805 00:57:44 nbsp The manager who runs this Round Table is very douchey.  Users/VMCrymore

20090901 17:42:22 nbsp Great place with delicious pizza. The Garlic Cheese Twists are to die for. They have very prompt and courteous service every time I dine in.
I do wish they had a greater vegetarian selection for the buffet. They only have Olive and Mushroom pizza. If they had to pick just one veggie pizza, why Olive and Mushroom??

Note: they describe their Gourmet Veggie pizza as having lots of chopped garlic. That is an understatement. The garlic overpowers the senses and the other flavors. Whether that is a good thing or not is up to you. Users/TheShah
  If you ask them to make a Veggie pizza (not Mushroom + Olive) and theyre not already making one they will make it for you. TusharRawat TR
   I went in for the buffet today. I asked if they could make a regular veggie pizza for the buffet, but the cashier said no, Its just how they keep track of things. I was the only one there, they made 4 pizzas, only one was vegetarian (the Mushroom + Olive). Kind of a waste considering the next people who ordered a buffet didnt come in for another half an hour. Users/TheShah
     Wow, thats pretty bad. I havent been to their buffet in a while but I may see if they do that all the time if I am there again. TusharRawat TR

20100109 14:59:23 nbsp My pizza had a good amount of pepperoni and the dough was really decent. The quality of the cheese and the sauce could probably be better, but the product is worth the money. Users/EdwardRiggins

20100531 10:00:53 nbsp I come here semiregularly for lunch buffet.  I always get prompt, courteous service. Users/drpottsiv

20100807 18:43:01 nbsp Be aware that Round Table is more expensive then some of the other pizza places in town, an extra Large chicken Garlic runs about $32, and delivery times on a saterday at about 6:30 take about an hour.  Users/PatrickMeddaugh

20101111 16:46:59 nbsp The pizza is what youd expect:  average.  The interior is grocerymall corporate:  formica and industrial carpet, completely charmless if clean.  That said, the place works quite well for families with small kids and they are very good about having team parties and so forth.  And the service is generally good  nice college kids.  I hate to say it, but Ive been going here for various events for about 10 years now. Users/Flokkenfisch

20110727 14:25:51 nbsp recently I had a conversation with a current employee while at another pizza restaurant that we both were dining at about the way round table is run from the inside and I must say I am disturbed at what I have heard I have on some occasions had problems with my order but I now believe the management is most likely the cause my wife orders from round table 3 times a month at least but after what I have heard I dont believe we will be ordering from here anymore its is not the family community supporting place we believed it to be. Users/codybanks

20111210 20:38:06 nbsp The Ultimeat pizza is quite tasty and the employees are always very nice.  I miss the fire roasted pizzas :( Users/LoriOrf
