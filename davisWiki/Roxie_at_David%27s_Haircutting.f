20081016 20:27:26 nbsp David haircutting had great reviews. I called for an appointment but he was busy, so was referred to Roxie. I recieved an excellent hair cut and with the student discount the price was right. Everyone knows how hard it is to find someone who does your hair exactly the way you want and I have found Roxie.

20081016 20:46:27 nbsp I went to Roxie because David was booked up and I really needed to get a cut that Saturday.  David told Roxie who then called me and she thankfully stayed after her normal hours to see me at 6:30pm.  She had a great personality and we conversed a lot during the whole cut.  She gave me a great cut and really knows how to make someone feel better about themselves.  Although I will always be loyal to David as long as Im in Davis, I would recommend Roxie to anyone.

20081206 12:32:47 nbsp I went to Roxie because of the reviews here, on DavisWiki.  It was a great decision  Roxie did a lovely job on my hair and I loved the way it turned out!  Id worn my hair the same way for a long time, so I wanted to try getting bangs.  Roxie worked around the massive cowlick Ive got, and my new bangs look exactly the way I wanted.  Ill definitely be recommending her to my friends! Users/romylmn

20090105 12:19:12 nbsp Roxie worked some serious magic on my long, thick, curly hair. She listened to my concerns, came up with awesome suggestions, and then transformed my out of control hair into a shiny, bouncy, super flattering bob. After years of bad cuts I can finally feel comfortable with my natural curls. I cant recommend Roxie enough!

20090109 13:48:22 nbsp I went to Roxie for highlights and a cut and she did an awesome job!! She listened to what I wanted and did it exactly how I wanted it! I loved the way she did my hair! I will definently go to her again!! Users/AimeeB

20090112 18:12:08 nbsp I have been thinking about cutting my hair very short for a while, but I knew with a daring cut like that it could either be really good or really bad.  I explained to Roxie exactly what I wanted and we looked at pictures together.  She gave me a great pixie cut that I just love.  She has very reasonable rates, and I immediately felt comfortable with her. Users/ERHogan

20090128 09:40:42 nbsp I was recommended to Roxie from a friend. She did a wonderful job! I was nervous about cutting my hair too short but she suggested it would look good. She followed what I requested and it was a good cut. After blowing drying it, I realized shorter would look more sassy so asked her to trim it some more and she did. She spent a lot of time on my hair and gave me a wonderful cut. I will defiantly reccomend her to anyone! Shes an artist.  Users/gena

20090303 15:53:44 nbsp Roxie has been cutting my hair since 1994 and her cuts are definitely the best Ive ever had. I moved away from California in 2003, and I still go back to her whenever possible. I wear my hair in a swing cut that looks like it would be simple, but its apparently very hard to achieve. Since I left Davis, Ive gone to stylists all over the country (some of them in very swanky, bigname salons) and no one has ever done the cut as smoothly and precisely as Roxie. Shes a magician with a pair of scissors and she really loves cutting hair which makes her the ideal stylist for folks who want a fabulous cut that falls into place naturally with no fuss, no mussstraight or curly, long or short, Roxie does it all. Not only that, she entertains you at the same time with wonderful stories about travel, Bay Area shopping, antiques, home renovations, Davis history, you name it. Treat yourself to a haircut by Roxieyoull have a great time and your hair will look fabulous!

20090306 16:50:38 nbsp I just went to Roxie for the first time and loved her and the cut she gave me. What a sweet person, so easy to chat with, and a great hairstylist. I am almost never happy with my haircuts, but I am really happy with this one. Users/Mara

20090318 07:27:20 nbsp I went to Roxie wanting a completely different hairstyle and she did an awesome job. My hair was past my shoulders in length and I wanted to get a shaggy bob. Roxie made it happen. Ive gotten so many complements. Thanks. Users/Jennifier

20090417 13:55:49 nbsp Searching to get my haircut I came across Roxie @ Davids on this wiki. Once I was tired of reading all of the great reviews, I scheduled an appointment.  Yes, theres a reason why there are so many great reviews.  Truely the best haircut Ive ever had.  Highly recommend! Users/PaulH

20090423 16:04:05 nbsp Hi Roxie! You gave me the best haircut of my life. I have gotten TONS of compliments! Thank you so much :) Users/kchacon

20090430 08:39:56 nbsp I went in o Roxie yesterday, and she did an amazing job! She really listened to what I wanted and explained how I could achieve te same styling as she styled my hair after the cut. She was very friendly and showed that she cared to make me look my best.

20090602 17:38:32 nbsp Was referred to Roxie from my roommate who loved her cut and thought Roxie did a great job.  Not only did she cut my hair the way I asked, but she spent a lot of time showing me different ways to wear the cut (curly and straight). Then she told me to call her if I had any questions about styling it at home and said I could come in sometime to style it myself with her watching to give me tips!  She was very friendly and knowledgeable about hair. Definitely recommend her!   Users/KMeo

20090701 13:43:02 nbsp Roxie started cutting my hair 25 years ago when both our sons were in Little League together.  Her hair cuts are consistently good.  We have seen each other through all of lifes ups and downs, but Roxie remains upbeat and cheerful through it all.  As long as she is cutting hair, I would never go to anyone else.  She is the best!  Users/JamieBoston

20090827 10:22:45 nbsp 10 years ago I made my first appointment with Roxie.  All I wanted was the same haircut I have been doing for years. Roxie cut my hair that same way for about 5 years until the day I got enough courage to change my hairstyle.  Roxie knows hair she knew exactly what to do with my thin, straight, no body hair. Both her and myself came up with my new look; a new fresh haircut and I loved it.  I always have Roxie cut my hair; she is one I can trust to cut my hair the same or give me a new style whenever I choose.  I was very bummed when she was not working and had to get my hair cut elsewhere.  I had one bad hair cut in her absence and chose not to see another hairdresser for about 6 months.  I did not know what to do, and then I heard Roxie was back.  I made an appointment right then and have been seeing since.  I missed Roxie while she was gone but I am ecstatic that she is back.

20090904 17:14:17 nbsp Had to have my hair cut by the fabulous Roxie after my boyfriend came home bragging about his hair (Paul H)!! Thank you Roxie for a great experience and wonderful haircut! Anais Users/AnaisD

20090917 19:20:52 nbsp Roxie has cut my hair twice and I will not go to anyone else! My haircut was so good that a customer at my work insisted on taking pictures of me and bringing them to Roxie to get the exact same cut. I think she is a true professional  amazing! Users/jheinlein

20091009 16:04:24 nbsp I got a haircut from Roxie a couple of weeks ago. Hands down, it was the best haircut I have ever gotten. I got a haircut earlier that same day and it was a disaster, and I called Davids to see if they could get me in and half an hour later I was sitting in the chair explaining my situation. I wanted a particular style, described it to Roxie and showed her a picture, and it ended up exactly the way I wanted. She was really cool to talk to and again, is amazing at what she does. I highly, highly recommend her! Users/linz7204

20091020 18:58:21 nbsp My hairstylist whom I was going to since I was a freshman in college decided to retire just earlier this year. So I went to someone else and lets just say that didnt work out so well at all. So I heard Roxie was the best and decided I might as well give it a shot. Well, shes everything everybody has said she is! Shes super friendly and down to earth and easy to talk to. We conversed the entire time even though the shop was quiet and empty. She cut it EXACTLY the way I wanted it to be but made it even better! I told her I wanted sexy hair and she made that happen. It was $50 but thats because my hair was super long to begin with (almost to my butt), and that included a shampoo and wash, the cut, and she even took the time to style it. She gave lots of advice on how to style and volumnize my hair since Im not so crafty with how to do my hair. In the end? I ended up with sexy Victorias Secret model hair, walked out super happy and confident, and found my new hairdresser. I will definitely be back and Ill definitely be recommending Roxie to everyone I know! Users/syang
