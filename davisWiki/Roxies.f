20050831 13:17:19 nbsp I highly recommend Justin for cut and coloring.  Very good service.  Hes the one with the Edward Scissorhands doll at his workstation and does a very good job. Users/IrenePark

20051102 23:32:53 nbsp they distroyed my hair luckily i was able to get it fixed by someone els. I told them exaclty what i wanted which was just a few layers and that is not what they did. When i confronted them they just said sorry. when she was cutting my hair she was not even paying attention she was chatting it up with some one then left me for 3 min while she was on the phone talking to someone about what they where doing that weeeked. Now is that proffesional or what? Users/SarahMiller

20060330 21:42:46 nbsp Sarah, sorry to hear about your unpleasant experience, but I definitely need to add my very positive one to this page.  Justin has been doing my hair for a few years now, and I have always been very happy with his work.  Not only that, but he is very kind and accommodating.  I have changed my style and color back and forth drastically many times over the years, and he has never complained or suggested that I do otherwise, as I have known other stylists I have seen in the past to do.  Instead, he enthusiastically sets off to make your hair goregeous!  It is obvious that he really enjoys his job.  He is always very kind and friendly and goes out of his way to make you happy, including staying extra long hours to complete the 3part process on your hair.  Obviously, I would recommend going to him.  Also, the aesthetician (waxing and facial person, I think she also does massages), Rita, is very good and also friendly.  Her room is also decorated beautifully and very calming.  Be warned, however, that this place is not cheap, but it makes all the differnece in the world to me to receive both friendly treatment and superior services.  I cant say that I have any complaints about this place, at least not from my own personal experience, but the only person whos ever done my hair here is Justin.  I did accompany a good friend to have her hair colored by one of the other stylists, who did not do to her hair what she asked.  She was also not very friendly.  I would be willing to bet it was the same person who did your hair.  Other than her, this place is great!  It will be a very sad day for my hair when I have to move and find someone else to trust with it!          Users/CatLa

20061112 09:11:50 nbsp I went to Roxies a few times after a friend recommended Justin as a stylist. I loved the work he did, however, I was not pleased with his customer service. The last time I tried to get a cut, I realized I had written the wrong time down and called to let them know I was running late (this was about 10 minutes after my scheduled appointment began). I was told to come in anyways, however, when I arrived, I was informed that Justin had left for the day. I had only arrived 15 minutes late!!! I realize a stylist depends on their appointments arriving ontime so they can make money. I always tip 20 percent and I was willing to go home with wet/unstyled hair as a result of my tardiness. I was disappointed in the service provided and regardless of his skills with the scissors and color, I refuse to return to someone who treats their customers in such a way.  Users/KaitlinSufit

20070125 13:31:23 nbsp Incredibly disappointing Users/StephaniePatrick

20070131 20:58:26 nbsp I would definitely recommend Justin. I have been to him many times and he is always consistent and does incredible color and cuts. And he is very nice. The salon has a nice atmosphere Users/JudyNaylor

20070208 19:38:00 nbsp I cant even comment on their abilities with hair because I had the WORST service evernot only did Roxie herself screw up my scheduling time, when I did come in at an appropriate time for her, she was so behind schedule that I was waiting for 45 minutes.  She then proceeded to let a cranky regular with an appointment after mine go ahead of me. I will NEVER go back there! Users/TheBean

20070406 19:23:48 nbsp I went to Roxies to get a bikini wax. After paying about $55 for an extremely painful experience, she had missed many spots and I was still covered in wax. Although the lady was nice and tried to make her yanking out my hair as painless as possible, I was very very unsatisfied. I would definitely not recommend going here to get a bikini wax. Users/JenniferSpies

20070607 20:13:34 nbsp Justins cut is to die for. He is also great with color. True artists! Users/Rosie

20070731 10:37:59 nbsp Justin is now at a new salon at 241 F st. next to Wheel Works bike shop. Users/Thefusion1

20070803 15:26:07 nbsp Does anyone know where Justin is now? I went into Roxies today and they said hes left. Users/cemcconnell

20070803 21:02:22 nbsp From what Ive heard (dont quote me yet), the bulk of the stylists are moving to Allure salon, which is in the process of remodeling.  Id at least give a call for Justin there.  If hes not there I gaurantee someone will know how to locate him soon.  Roxies was sold to someone from out of town several months ago. Users/Davidlm

20070806 19:12:55 nbsp Does anyone know where Roxie went? Users/lct

20070807 00:15:51 nbsp See above comment. Users/Davidlm

20070918 10:16:29 nbsp Roxies used to be a reputable salon, however four months ago they changed ownership and have thus failed to impress me. I went in with gift certificates that i had purchased for pedicures as a gift. My mom and i went in to redeem them on my birthday and they wouldnt honor them, even though the business is still called Roxies and thats what the gift certificates were for. They were VERY rude to me and when i asked for a refund they refused. This means that i have spent over sixty dollars that i will never benefit from! The least they could do is honor something that is for their business (they made the choice to buy it afterall) thats just bad practices!! I finally had to practically beat out of her where Roxie actually went  and she said somewhere on F and 3rd street, im not sure which salon.   Users/LeaShell

20070918 21:45:37 nbsp All the stylists that were at Roxies are now at Ninas Studio. Roxies (the salon) has been closed every time Ive gone by, so Im pretty sure nobody is cutting hair there right now (I could be wrong). Users/Davidlm
