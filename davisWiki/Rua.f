Rua is named for his red tail. Users/DanielleC is Irish and so with no real creativity or effort decided to name him the Irish word for red, which is Rua. Brava. Despite his owners lack of creativity he is a very personable and affable young snake. He enjoys spending time on his branch under the heat lamp lording over all in sundry ( ie his brother snake Samhain).
