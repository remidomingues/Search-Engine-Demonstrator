The Davis Wiki is a nonprofit which, per its agreement with the IRS, cannot be used to promote businesses.  Other editors have had to tone down the promotional language on Bluebird many times now.

Also, please be aware that the IP address used to make each edit is publicly visible.  Anyone who looks can see that you are editing from the same computer or internet connection as users/niten, users/joyenH, and js95618.

Its great to document things on Davis, but its deceptive to use sockpuppets and its inappropriate to advertise. Users/TomGarberson
