 Candidate Statement 

Dear fellow students,
My name is Rudy Ornelas and I am running for ASUCD Senate with the Leadership Empowerment Activism Determination slate (LEAD). I am a secondyear Sociology and Political Science double major.  During my two years at this university I have worked in student government as a Supreme Court justice and I have experience as a representative of the Undergraduate Students in the Undergraduate Council of the Academic Senate.

As a member of the Supreme Court, I had an inside look at the student government and while I never intended to be a senator, I witnessed many instances in which studentsâ€™ voices, and their best interests, were ignored.  I also found that many students have either never heard of the student government, or do not know what the student government does.  I feel that students need to be informed and be made active members of their student government and school community.

I spoke with many students while creating my platforms, and one issue I found to be central to our campus is the lack of free prints allotted to students each quarter. Four years ago students received 120 free prints, but now we only receive 30. I want to work to make this number more acceptable for the students of our campus. Also, there are several fees imposed upon students when the allotted number of prints is surpassed, but the fees are not posted and students are not told about them. I will work to have these fees posted up at printing labs so students are informed about costs.

Students also want better entertainment choices. The Coffee House once brought in big name entertainment like The Ramones, The Police, Iggy Pop, and others. One of the big things standing in our way is a lack of funding for the Entertainment Council. I want to work with the Entertainment Council to find more funding through business cosponsorships to bring in more headline entertainment to our campus.

Most importantly, I am running for the students to give them a louder voice within their student government, on their campus, and in the state capitol. Feel free to contact me about any issues or simply to talk. Feel free to me or contact me via Facebook, or stop me if you see me around campus and I will be happy to answer ANY questions you have.

If you want a student government that has the students best interests at heart and is willing to work for you, than remember to vote Rudy Ornelas #1 for ASUCD Senate, LEAD #26, and Jack and Previn for your President and Vice President.
