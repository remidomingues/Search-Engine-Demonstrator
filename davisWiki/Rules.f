The following are some nonbinding rules that should ensure a good time is had by all.

 How to Make a Good Mystery Picture 

 1. Objects in the mystery photo should be able to be observed from a publicly accessible place.

 2. The mystery photo should be taken in Davis. That is to say that it is within city limits, on the UC Davis campus, or on the outskirts of town.

 3. The objects should not be something that is likely to change significantly so as to be deemed unrecognizable in between the time that you take the picture and a guess is made.

 4. Something about the object should be unique or unusual, whether it be the object itself or the objects relationship to its location.  (Ex: A picture of a No Parking sign is a bad idea, unless its found sticking out of a tree.)

 5. The object should be guessable without hints, or an initial hint should frame it in this way.

 6. Once youre ready to post your mystery photo, think of a list of progressively more revealing hints to provide in case nobody guesses correctly.  The hints shouldnt stand alone, and should only be used after its clear that guessers really dont have a clue.

 Breaking the Rules 

Photos that relate strongly to Davis but are not in Davis (say, a shot of astronauts doing a spacewalk wherein one is from Davis) may be pretty good.  If its not obvious, you should probably make it clear in an initial comment.  Something generic or unguessable might be guessable by an event or circumstance that make it memorable.  In general the above rules are pretty good guides, but dont feel utterly bound to them if you have a good Davis specific and guessable image to use.

 How to Guess 

 1. The best guess (receiving a full 10 from the judges) will be in the form of a picture revealing the larger contextual location of the object.

 2. The second best guess (maybe receiving a 9 from the judges) provides a location of the object precise enough that others could also find it.

 3. Ask for hints before asking questions like is it on campus?, is it in the Green Belt?, or is it edible?.

 4. After the Mystery Photo poster has run out of hints, ask questions phrased in a yes/no format.

 When Does a Photo Go to the Unsolved Box? 

(after X incorrect guesses...? or after Y days of inactivity...?)
  Inactivity seems like a better choice than number of guesses.  There could be many guesses because the picture is not obvious, is not something people have come across, or because a lot of people are interested in that particular picture.  Inactivity indicates lack of interest (or possibly that everyone has gone on vacation and is not watching the picture anyway.)  Note that activity should be greater during the school year, as should the number of guesses.
