How many miles to Adventures Outside of Davis Babylon?
Three score and ten
Can I get there by Night time candlelight?
Yes, there and back again
If your heels are swift and light
You will get there by Flashlights candlelight

Running elevates your heart rate. People do this for Exercise exercise, for Sports sport, for social interaction, to escape Davis Police Department incarceration, or simply for the merits of being Outdoor Activities outside. You can run most anywhere, but there are some Places to Walk or Run places to run that are better than others. Also, no matter how slow you are, youre faster than The Joggers these joggers. Also, check out some of the favorite training runs of the topranked Davis High cross country team on these interactive maps  http://www.dhscrosscountry.com/nssfolder/greenbeltroutes/index.html  created as an Eagle Scout project by former team member Kenny Durell, Class of 2008, now running for Columbia University. On the green belt, Botsdots mark every half mile on the routes and online the maps include water fountain locations. All runs begin and end at the high school track, giving you an opportunity to check out the new stadium on your way out and back.

If you are out running it can be useful to know where water fountains are located. There is a http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ieUTF&msa0&msid118130734379396620379.0004968a8c061c9e81042  editable Google map with some fountains around Davis.

Some training plans require uphill running, which is challenging in Davis. The Davis High cross country team runs on the itty bitty hills at the corner of F. St. and Covell (Community Park).  Theres also a modest hill there in the form of a pedestrian walkway over Covell.  Theres a significantly larger flyover on the Davis Bike Loop over I80, between the Richards and Mace exits.  Aside from those very limited hills, you could do some trail running over at Stebbins Cold Canyon Reserve, if you dont mind a bit of a drive (~30 mins), or you could go with hill settings on a treadmill.
