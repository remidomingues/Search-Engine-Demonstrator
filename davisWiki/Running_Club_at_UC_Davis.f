Welcome to the Running Club at UC Davis! The clubs goal is to offer passionate runners an opportunity to compete again. With such stringent standards in college XC, sometimes your best is just not enough. But in this club, everyone is free to join and we only expect your best.

Please note that we are a competitive club; its just the competition wont be as intense as the one you would normally find in a college setting.

If you are interested, you can either contact me or attend a meeting where Im able to get your information.
