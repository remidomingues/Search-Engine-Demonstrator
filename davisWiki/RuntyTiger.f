RuntyTiger, a.k.a Eric Tarng is a student of UC Davis since Fall 2005 and will be getting his Bachelors Degree in Summer 2010.

Hi there, I guess in a way I can look at Davis as a second home of sorts. I am a Wildlife, Fish, and Conservation Biology major and hope to graduate this coming summer. Although I am an adult, I consider myself a kid in many respects. I enjoy visiting the Arboretum, working up a sweat at the ARC, meeting and hanging out with friends, playing Magic the Gathering, and Art.

In Fall 2009, I participated in Diane Ullmans Shield Oak project at the Arboretum (I did Quercus Tomentella in case you were wondering).

Davis has been a wonderful experience for me, and I hope to put those experiences in my Art in the future.
