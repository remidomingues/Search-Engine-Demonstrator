When not trying to conquer the political sphere, further building upon his 2200+ CD collection, and listening to underground hiphop/crust punk/DOOM metal, Russell enjoys long walks on the beach, reading a good book next to the fire place, and arguing with people about pointless/semiimportant/important issues (aka being a smartass).
