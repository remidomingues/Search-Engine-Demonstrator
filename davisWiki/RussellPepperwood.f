20080122 18:09:04 nbsp Thanks for making positive edits to Pepperwood Apartments. A Welcome to the Wiki would be a little late at this point, but Id like to extend one anyway. Users/JasonAller

20080713 23:31:56 nbsp Howdy. Regarding your edits on the Pepperwood Apartments page, you might want to check out the Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner tips for business owners. Users/JoePomidor

20080714 21:08:11 nbsp The material Joe edited was originally added http://daviswiki.org/Pepperwood_Apartments?actiondiff&version221&version120 in this edit by Davisgrad13.  Joe simply reverted your http://daviswiki.org/Pepperwood_Apartments?actiondiff&version234&version133 removal. Users/PhilipNeustrom

20080714 22:18:21 nbsp If you use the Info button at the top of a page it will let you see the history and the comments that editors left with each edit (if they left any). It will also help you track down who made a comment, versus who reverted content back into a page. For example if you go to http://daviswiki.org/Pepperwood_Apartments?actioninfo it will show you the history of how the page came to be and what portions were contributed by which people. There is a general trend to revert edits that remove content as explained on the Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner page. Users/JasonAller

20080715 00:35:48 nbsp Its not actually my comment. The wiki oftentimes encounters business owners who will change the contents of their page in order to remove content that they feel http://daviswiki.org/Diana%27s_Nails?actiondiff&version251&version150 damaging to their interests. However, the wiki is designed to be a communal creation, and thus it is inherently impartial. I replaced the content you deleted because I felt that by deleting it you were damaging that impartiality. Users/JoePomidor

20080723 16:40:47 nbsp My edit regarding Pepperwood Apartments was not a personal attack, as RussellPepperwood interpreted it. I merely posted 2 facts: the first being that Pepperwood is managed by FPI management, and the second being that FPI management has a very bad reputation in Davis, as demonstrated by their FPI Management wiki page. While I respect Russells right to defend his own complex, it is very important information for consumers, especially if they are trying to avoid management companies who are known for illtreatment of their tenants and/or illegal business practices Users/Davisgrad13

20110107 13:02:20 nbsp I put back the part of the other comment that you deleted on the Pepperwood page. Its generally a nono to edit other peoples comments. Users/JoePomidor
