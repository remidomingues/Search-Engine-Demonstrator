Russell Park is an oncampus apartment complex that specializes in housing for students with families.  It is privately owned and managed by Tandem Properties, but located on the campus of UC Davis. The land lease agreement with the university stipulates that apartments at Russell Park be offered to student families before any other type of tenancy is considered. If they are unable to fill their units, the next on the list of consideration are Grad Students graduate students, and then undergraduate students.

Like Atriums at La Rue Park Apartments The Atriums, Russell Park is bound by the universitys fiscal year so rates are on an academic calendar, and new rates are approved in May of each year.  Because the apartments are relatively large for the price, there tends to be a long, long wait list to get in (well over a year in some cases).  Turnover is very low compared to other apartments in Davis and this says good things about the complex.

Anybody has 3bedroom apartment here and is looking for summer sublet, please let me know.  I may be able to take over your lease and renew for next year.  I can be reached at yzhengusc@gmail.com.

20090703 02:37:58 nbsp we lived here several year and there used to be far more grad. students and families with small children. Now it seems like theres a move to only accept young undergraduates. Last year and this year virtually everyone new to Russell Park is 18 and lives with roommates. They drive really fast through the parking and hang out outside making lots of noise until 3 or 4 in the morning. The playgrounds are becoming less a place for kids to play and more a place to hang out all night and drink beer. Instead of moms in minivans its now SUVs blasting hip hop in the parking lot.

20101226 19:29:17 nbsp Is the gas and electricity included? Thanks.  Users/HarrisonM

20110209 23:31:35 nbsp No, gas and electricity are not included. Water is. Users/twblalock

20120103 19:09:22 nbsp Ive lived here for under a year, and I love it. Its a quiet complex; VERY close to campus (a twominute walk from Trader Joes/Cost Plus/Starbucks etc., the ARC, Student Health Center); management and maintenance are efficient, professional, and friendly; and the onebedroom floor plan is spacious and welllaidout. The apartment itself is a little older, so its not super pretty inside, but its not ugly or shoddily built like several other places Ive seen in Davis (plus it sounds like theyre updating at least some of the units starting this summer)(EDIT: Ive since moved into one of the remodeled units, and I really like it! The kitchen is very pretty). Ive also never had problems with package delivery, and their four laundry rooms are clean and always working. If your apartment is near/facing the day care center, youll hear kids screaming and playing from around 105 on weekdays, but it is a family complex after all, and its really not too loud.Users/zombiek

20120219 02:26:49 nbsp I shared a 3bedroom apartment at Russell Park during 20102011 and was fairly satisfied.

The top perk about living at Russell Park is the location. There is usually a huge price premium associated with living oncampus, but rent here isnt all too unreasonable. Rent for a 3B/2BA was 1450/mo in 2010 and was bumped up to 1522/mo in 20112012. I was told that the rate increase was primarily due to the increased charges for University Police and Fire Department services. As mentioned in the rest of this page, Trader Joes, Starbucks, The Old Teahouse, and a whole bunch of other services are right across the Russell Blvd. at University Mall.

The management is professional and does a good job of handling package deliverieseven during the postThanksgiving shipping rush. Sometimes youll get a UPS InfoNotice slip on your USPS mailbox, other times you wont. Just be mindful of when to expect packages and drop down by the leasing office to pick things up. Maintenance is quick to respond to all service requeststhey travel around the complex on electric golf carts.

They used to allow postdocs and campus employees to be leaseholders, but Ive heard that theyre only allowed to house fulltime continuing UC Davis students. That means anyone else would have to be added on with renewing UC Davis students. Once again, the management excels at handling all of the messy paperwork involved in joint leases and can even accomodate transfers other Russell Park units if you decide to ditch your housemates when it comes to renewal time.

There are four laundry rooms, one at each corner of the complex. These are all coinop when I was there, so be sure to save up some quarters. It was 1.25/wash and 0.75/dryor something like that. Ive had a few instances where my quarters would get stuck and Id have to shimmy a knife into the slot to get things rolling, but thats to be expected. It would appear that they moved the USPS mailboxes inside the laundry rooms due to safety concerns, but that happened after I left.

Its a rather quiet complex. The worst Ive had to endure were crows cawcawing during early Winter mornings. Consider it a free morning wakeup call. Users/Roarasaurus

20121117 21:27:56 nbsp I am living in atriums apartments this year and have been very happy so far. Yesterday I was in the office and I overheard a fraternity member complaining to staff about recent bike thefts and car break in. Just a warning to all residents about this. I think its an easy community for thieves to prey on due to density of student body. I am a little worried about crime though after last years warnme message about the gang member from sac who threw his gun in the childerns playground while evading police.

I wish there was an easier way to check crime reports for this area. Does ucdavis police provide this service? Users/shraken

 Hi Shraken, Im glad to hear youve been happy with your experience at The Atriums. While we dont know the crime rates at Russell Park or The Atriums to be especially high, bike theft is certainly an unfortunate issue in all Davis communities. Locking your bike is one way to help prevent theft. As the police are the official keepers of statistics on these matters, we encourage our residents to view updates posted by the UC Davis Police Department at police.ucdavis.edu and to inform police of any incidents. You may also find this resource from campus police on crime prevention to be useful http://police.ucdavis.edu/crime/prevention/crimepreventionresources. Paying attention and sharing information as neighbors are the best things we can do to promote our communitys safety. This is the main reason that we send out informational notices whenever any incident of crime is brought to our attention. You are also always welcome and encouraged to contact our office staff with any questions or concerns that you have. Take Care, Trish (Residential Manager, Russell Park Apartments) Users/TrishW
