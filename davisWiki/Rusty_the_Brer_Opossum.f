Rusty the Brer Opossum is a rad little Opossums possum. Hes so smart! Hes blind so he clicks to find his way around. And hes so cute. Hes got many photos on the Opossums page, and is mentioned numerous times on LJ; http://www.livejournal.com/users/jnork/143516.html here, http://www.livejournal.com/users/jnork/146205.html here, and http://www.livejournal.com/users/jnork/146922.html here. If you let him smell your shoes or give him cat food he will let you pet him. Hes also kind of ticklish on his sides and hates the sound of shoes rubbing against the big mats in the pool area of The Arbors.

20050818 22:09:49 nbsp The clicking sound is made by all opossums. Males click when searching for mates and when feeling defensive or aggressive. Females click to communicate with their young. This has been your awesome opossum fact of the day!  Users/CherylChooljian
