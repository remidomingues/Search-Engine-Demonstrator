  Ive seen more grace under fire from the 20042005 ASUCD Elections Committee than the impression the Sac Bee article gave of Asmundson.  Welcome to real politics. Users/BrentLaabs

  Thats it! I am leaving this town. I am literally moving from Davis tomorrow (no joke) and I am glad! I think reading about an event like this only reaffirms my desire to leave the Peoples Republic of Davis. If the mayor doesnt have the ability to hold a meeting regarding my safety, i think i will live somewhere in Sacramento county. Davis...you were a great place because I made many life long friends...but the politics of this place with its history of toad tunnel/hurt feelings mayors makes it the laughing stock of the nation. Thank you  Mayor Asmundson for being a great leader when it actually counts. I really hope that Yolo County will be ok from West Nile...because if something happens, I think we all know who to blame....the paranoid hippies of this community and the politicans who cant hold meetings! Folks..here is some advice; running for political office is great, but never take the duty of public service lightly. If you melt under pressure, PLEASE dont be a leader ...for the sake of our health...literally!  Users/GeorgejAndrews

20051103 06:31:10 nbsp was she first asian ever to be elected, or just the first one in the 90s? If the latter, what an asian town we live in. Users/ApolloStumpy

20060318 03:42:38 nbsp Asmundson is comfortable with the procedure we followed in Halema Buzayan Buzayan case.  I think anybody who takes a good look at it will see that she is very wrong to be comfortable with the procedure the police followed here.  Phil and I have both written to her in protest of her support for this obvious misconduct and I hope a lot of other citizens will too. Users/KenjiYamada
