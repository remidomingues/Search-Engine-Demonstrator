20090415 01:25:54 nbsp How about the Banduh stop changing the rules from year to year and then we say it isnt cheating? And sorry, gentlemens agreements that nobody has even heard of until everything is over with are Shadiness factor shady. I mean... I love the Banduh as much as anyone (I was a member at one point), but its really ridiculous that you guys insist on so many things that are obviously false to the uninvolved outsider.

Simply put, it isnt a battle unless you can fight to the end.  If the parties agree to a tie and end the battle, so be it. But to say that the battle is tied when people are still willing to fight and that anyone who plays on after that doesnt win when everyone else is gone... the Banduh cant help but win or tie. They win or tie by definition. And sorry, thats cheating by manipulating the rules.

20090415 01:42:40 nbsp Assume for a moment, that the BandUh! is Robert Mugabe.  President Mugabe wants to win an upcoming election.  Mr. Mugabe is also in charge of making sure that the election is run properly, as it is his country (and he is the President).  So Mugabe makes a rule that says All candidates elected as President must be Robert Mugabe.  Sure, other people can run, but we all know the result before hand.  So tell me, in what way is the BandUh! not like President Mugabe?

By the way, Ive spent six years at Davis and have many friends in the band... and I only have one vague acquaintance from Humboldts band.  So if anything, Im biased towards Davis. Users/BrentLaabs
