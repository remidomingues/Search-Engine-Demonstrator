20100210 18:48:23 nbsp This is a discussion that needs to not take place in a typing medium, I would love to share some of my thought with your further Users/StevenDaubert

20110201 12:21:39 nbsp Hey Ryan! It is srs bsnss indeed. Unfortunately, our previous agreement with Mr. Champagne doesnt seem to be valid, although all parties were under the impression it was. CampusCred doesnt dabble much in bylaws and we definitely dont want to be breaking any copyright infringement laws, so I was wondering if you could please assist us in the drafting of a new agreement with ASUCD? You seem knowledgeable of the topic and interested. We, CampusCred, are for students, by students, very much like ASUCD, and so having someone knowledgeable of ASUCD bylaws and how we should word future agreements assist us would be critical to better communications with student government in the future. Thanks!  Users/LeoThom

20120208 23:45:48 nbsp thanks for that edit, It was supposed to say office running for (I got it right on the daviswiki normal page). Actually the profile thing was my first confused attempt at creating a daviswiki.  Sorry about that. Users/JonathanSooHoo

20130209 23:11:49 nbsp The irony does not escape me that I forgot to put you on the Independents page considering you won your seat via the Constitutional change I pushed through ASUCD. Thanks for fixing that and giving me a good laugh. Users/JonathonLeathers

20131003 12:08:57 nbsp One of the only times Ive ever seen a newly created featured page done well.  You put in the needed effort to make a page worth featuring, plus it is an interesting Davisy topic.  Impressive!  (insert applause) Users/JabberWokky
