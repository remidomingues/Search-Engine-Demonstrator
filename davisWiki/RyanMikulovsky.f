See my wiki:chico:Users/RyanMikulovsky user page on Chico Chicos Wiki.  DavisWiki was my inspiration.  This wiki nearly compelled me to move into the Davis area prior to 2007.


 Education 
I attended wiki:chico:Butte Community College from August 2006 to Spring 2009.  I began studying UC Davis Geology Department Geology in the Fall of 2009, at UC Davis.  I have focused on Geographical Information Systems (GIS), and my coursework includes scripting (automating) GIS.  Im very interested in using GIS and statistical software (such as http://www.rproject.org R) in any future research.

A mission that Ive adopted recently is to convince student geologists that computers are useful tools that dont have to make the last two weeks of the quarter miserable...

 Employment 
For the summers of 2008 and 2009, I worked with the USDA wiki:wikipedia:USDA Forest Service Forest Service as an http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/ncc/internship/ intern in the areas of hydrology and geology.

For summer of 2010, I compiled geology data for the USFS Mendocino National Forest and surveyed for unstable land (e.g., landslides).

 Activities 

 Solving Geological Problems using Computers 
See my blog: http://geo.distortions.net

 GIS 
wiki:wikipedia:GIS is a perfect companion for City Wikis.  People love maps!  Of course wiki:wikispot has a mapping feature that geolocates addresses using Google Maps.  But thats about it.  Thus the usefulness of GIS.  My http://www.distortions.net website has a handy list of data sources that I use for maps on this wiki.

 Past Mapping Projects 
I have used http://www.qgis.org Quantum GIS, http://www.inkscape.org Inkscape, and http://www.gimp.org The GIMP to create and finish the following maps:

  Apartments.  As time permits I am combining data from various sources including the City of Davis http://cityofdavis.org/gis/library/ GIS Library and http://www.openstreetmaps.org OpenStreetMaps.org to create a useful set of maps showing locations of Apartments.  The maps may be modified at any time for data corrections, cartographic reasons, and for other general fixes.  All sources licensed their data through Creative Commons and thus these products are too.
  Covell Greenbelt.  Im interested in locating all features within the Covell greenbelt creating a useful map.

 Current Wiki Knowledge Building Efforts 
  I plan on completely revamping the geology page.  It is great as a very superficial introduction but makes simplifications that really dont do this regions history justice (for example, the Coastal Ranges are not just old sediment!  One of the most important mysteries, not quite solved by plate tectonics, exists there: The Franciscan!).  So hopefully after finals Ill find the words, references, and go wild.

  After, during, or before, I want to improve the Geography page since it also lacks some situational details.  And more glaringly, maps.
  Attempt to remove the stigma of the Bachelor of Arts in geology at UC.  Honestly, whats wrong with breadth? Thus I will ensure that the BS and BA are portrayed fairly on the UC Davis Geology Department page.
 Favorite Haunts 
As I find places that I cant live without in Davis, Ill list them here.  Then you can stalk me.  :P

 Genuine Favorites 
I have had good experiences at the following.  Note that Im a creature of habit thus this list may not change much.

  Davis Noodle City (havent had a bad meal yet and its getting cold... vegetarian KIMCHI SOUP!!!)
  Taqueria Guadalajara (North Davis)
  Raja Indian Cuisine
  El Mariachi (I dont remember why I listed this here.  Guess I need to go back.)
  Ding How


 Proposed 
Proposed favorite haunts require at least one good inrestaurant or store experience.  If consecutive good experiences occur, then it may migrate to the genuine favorite haunts section.

  Sushi Unlimited

 Blacklisted 
If at some point a restaurant or store is listed here, it means I will never return unless management or something else drastic changes.  Thus far no business in Davis warrants being listed here.

 Other Wikis 
  wiki:Chico  I began the Chico Wiki.
  http://wiki.hcoop.net  Ive contributed quite a bit to the Hosting Cooperative (HCoop) wiki.






20090210 11:47:30 nbsp Thanks for fixing the Mountain Mikes Pizza/2005 and 2006 Reviews problem! It was driving me nuts.  Users/ElleWeber

20090321 08:46:03 nbsp Joining groups without knowing that you have done so is a common occurrence in Davis.  This has probably happened to me at least 1 1/2 times.

When do you make the move from Chico (and its wiki) to Davis (and its wiki)? Users/IDoNotExist

20090321 13:04:39 nbsp There are a LOT of sublets available in Davis during the summer, because most of the students are not here.  You can get a place to live and keep your stuff relatively cheaply.  Or if you dont want to stay in 114 degree heat during the summer, you can get a storage unit.  The earlier you rent it, the easier it will be.  You dont want to be trying to rent it right before everyone in the town moves on September 1st. Users/IDoNotExist

20090422 12:25:37 nbsp Nice map!  Do you have any suggestions for good online tutorials for getting into QGIS and/or GRASS?  I have been wanting to learn some GIS for a while but shied away from it because of the cost of ARCGIS.  Also, would you say that learning QGIS/GRASS is a good stepping stone to learning ARCGIS, or are there significant differences? Users/TheAmazingLarry

20090426 07:09:30 nbsp Thanks for the GIS info.  Looks like some good resources! Users/TheAmazingLarry

20090429 17:04:53 nbsp thanks for catching that stat on the swine flu page, i must have misread the source was looking at. Users/JoePomidor

20090507 14:05:58 nbsp I like your checklist and Im probably going to use it. Users/MasonMurray

20090701 13:14:04 nbsp Welcome to Davis! Users/IDoNotExist

20090701 16:25:49 nbsp Did you finish your move? Users/IDoNotExist

20090802 21:28:18 nbsp Logical inconsistencies often cause computers to self destruct.  One only need look at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Return_of_the_Archons or http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I,_Mudd to see that this will sometimes cause them to explode, emit smoke (the smoke is what makes circuits work and must not be released), or freeze. Users/IDoNotExist

20090909 16:44:35 nbsp you should check out Zentoros its better than sushi unlimited Users/Jcurri31

20090912 18:01:16 nbsp FYI, if you were still wondering about the UCD email transition... Im a transfer as well.

I was stuck using the old (Gecko?) mail myself, but upon logging into MyAdmissions today, and then clicking on EMAIL from there... From there, I was able to setup a Davis Gmail (DavisMail?) account. Cheers! Users/H4rry

20090913 11:49:02 nbsp Yea Ive been on a semester system for my whole life... Im rather nervous about making the switch to quarter myself... Users/H4rry

20090917 09:49:23 nbsp Re: dup comments, there was an aggravated edit war on another wiki with automated tools that was hammering the database.  It looks to have calmed town. Users/JabberWokky

20090920 20:21:04 nbsp I think that I need to open a new Yogurt Shop.  Ill call it Ye Olde Yoghurt Shoppe. Users/RyanMikulovsky
  Ive always thought Lonesome Moo Yogurt would be good.  Similar to my idea (spawned when I first moved to California and misread Leatherbys Ice Cream as Leatherboys Ice Cream) of Whipped Cow Ice Cream Parlor and Leather Goods. jw

20090922 14:16:31 nbsp That graphic should probably be more prominent, both on that entry, and on various new to Davis entries.  NICE work  its Best o the wiki!   Users/JabberWokky

20090922 17:11:32 nbsp Ryan: I wonder if your maps could be overlaid onto one of Googles satellite or hybrid maps to create a map version that shows apt boundaries on something visible.  Also, is it possible to turn on street names and apt name labels on the apts themselves? Users/IDoNotExist

20090925 11:14:50 nbsp Hey Ryan! I havent seen you since high school. I dont know if you noticed, but I wrote the Sudwerk review above yours.

Ryan and I both live in Davis now, so we should all hang out. Send me an email sometime: My gmail address is craigrobertgilmore. Users/craiggilmore

20091006 11:28:30 nbsp Nice catch!  I added it to Wiki History. Users/JabberWokky

20091011 00:29:29 nbsp Im not sure exactly who deserves the huge wad of praise, you or JeremyOgul,for the proposed and actual Target store image juxtaposition, but it is brilliant. Users/SteveDavison

20091011 22:48:26 nbsp Why did you change the starbucks link on the target page to the woodland page? Users/NickSchmalenberger

20091012 16:59:04 nbsp Thanks, that makes sense now. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20091025 21:55:30 nbsp I think that was a exclamation of affirmation:  You Da Forest Service! Users/JabberWokky

20091026 10:29:28 nbsp About the 10/09 WikiBBQ, like any other Wiki activities, were all editors. My impression is UCD midterms stretch from the second week of the quarter to the ninth, but if this date was right before them, you could have proposed a change. Im not writing to criticize you and I appreciate that you made a comment. Im just reminding us that were all somewhat responsible for any shortcomings of the Wiki, and perhaps that extends to attempted social gatherings.  Users/DougWalter

20091028 18:44:50 nbsp I remember and know that if you had the time youd be in there fighting the good fight. Thank you for all your good edits. Users/JasonAller

20100222 12:56:26 nbsp thanks for the edit to dental questions page, that looks better.  My wife took some GIS classes, she thought it was very interesting. Users/DagonJones

20100601 16:05:00 nbsp Hey, Ryan... those maps you put on the OpenStreetMap entry dont appear to actually be from OpenStreetMap (i.e., the subject of the entry).   Wouldnt they make more sense on the general Maps entry? Users/JabberWokky

20110426 21:34:43 nbsp There is an $80/year web hosting option available on campus for departments that dont want to run their own servers. It includes several nice features and you get to use the campus Content Management System (CMS) for free as part of the deal. Have someone in Geology give me a call if they are interested in being pointed in that direction. Users/JasonAller

20110426 21:59:29 nbsp And the CMS is pretty cool. Users/JabberWokky
