My name is Ryan. Im in my fourth year at UC Davis. A triple major in English, Film Studies, and Japanese. I like to think I have diverse interests, but my attention tends to go mostly in the direction of films, likely leading me to a future as a video store clerk or Netflix envelope packer. Or do robots do that?

I have an informal club that is attempting to show a film every saturday. Called Guerrilla Movie Society. If youre interested in receiving info, check out the group on http://ucdavis.facebook.com/group.php?gid2226399633 facebook.


20060111 22:45:24 nbsp hows the coffee press?  Users/MichelleAccurso

20060113 00:53:20 nbsp I dont drink coffe, i just traded it because the animatronic snowman biker that sings was seriously frightening. Funny, but frightening. Users/RyanPrendiville

20060113 07:01:16 nbsp ha ha ha!! that it was Users/MichelleAccurso

20060218 03:55:56 nbsp Hey, why did you delete my redirect?  I wish you had brought it up for discussion instead of just deleting it unilaterally.  Im putting it back for now.  Please dont delete it again without discussion. Users/KenjiYamada

20060219 14:44:19 nbsp I see what youre saying.  I still think the name is intuitive, but you have a good point that there are other stores that sell similar merchandise.  Go ahead and delete the redirect if you want. Users/KenjiYamada

20060307 09:05:51 nbsp haha, no doubt, but you loved it.   Users/EdWins ES

20060408 22:43:35 nbsp About the drinking water in Africa thing, Users/NickSchmalenberger mostly just likes to argue. Hes not particularly bright (or if he is, hes socially challenged and outoftouch with reality). He argued something similarly stupid on the Ben & Jerrys: Vermonster Challenge page. Users/KaiTing

20060409 00:57:49 nbsp Why would you think I am kidding or that it is ridiculous that water resource problems are worldwide, including in California? Users/NickSchmalenberger

20060409 23:25:02 nbsp Immediate problems usually only happen to individuals or small groups and should be dealt with locally. Worldwide problems take a long time to develop and should be dealt with long term. To say that there are worldwide immediate problems is melodramatic. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20060410 01:01:04 nbsp http://daviswiki.org/NickSchmalenberger?actiondiff&date20&date11144643826 this made me laugh and think youre such an asshole all at the same time. sup cuz! Users/MichelleAccurso

20060420 21:27:45 nbsp Thank you for the kind words! I happened upon those swallows last year...serendipity or...I cant think of a proper adjective. Anyhow, I would love to photo some owls. I saw one just the other day and even had a camera with me, but alas, my lens was not adequate for how far the owl was from me. Do you know where all the owls chillax? Maybe I can come avisiting them with a good lens sometime. D Users/EliseKane

20060421 10:21:14 nbsp Wow! Thanks for the tips. I will have to visit the owlies sometime in the near future.  Users/EliseKane

20070330 01:19:45 nbsp Dont worry Ryan, someday youll be a video clerking or Netflix envelope packering, and youll see one of my films. And youll say to yourself, Hey! Thats my cousin! Speaking of family, are you going to the thing Saturday? Users/MichelleAccurso

20070505 23:52:03 nbsp Yes the benches outside the varisty are gone for good, I talked to a custy a couple days ago and he said he ground the granite that was the benches up and has it in piles in his backyard cause it was to nice to huck. Users/StevenDaubert

20070815 10:38:35 nbsp I like Ryan. He possesses an understanding of film that makes my own seem small and shallow, but talking to him at length makes me feel like Ive learned something when I walk away. Users/GeoffJohnson
