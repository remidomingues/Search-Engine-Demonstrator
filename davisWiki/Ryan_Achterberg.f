Ryan Achterberg is a candidate for ASUCD ASUCD Senate Senate in the Fall 2009 ASUCD Election running on the L.E.A.D. slate.

Hey UC Davis!

My name is Ryan Achterberg and I am a thirdyear Neurobiology, Physiology, and Behavior major running for ASUCD Senate with L.E.A.D.

My philosophy has always been one of selfmotivation. I believe one of the best ways to create change is to get out there and make it yourself. Thats where I see the future of ASUCDYOUR opinions and thoughts on safety, equality and student policy actually on open ears through open doors. Through my various experiences on campus I believe I would make a great candidate for ASUCD Senate and I am here to work for you.

I intend to effortlessly work to see that what is being done would be best for all students. I plan on doing everything in my power to represent YOU to the best of my ability. If you have any ideas or would like to voice your opinion, please dont hesitate to let me know. Some of the issues I plan to work on during my term as Senator are included below.

Lets make this election count: YOU can do it! Donâ€™t forget to vote Ryan Achterberg and the rest of the LEAD Candidates for ASUCD Senate this quarter.

SENATE GOALS


Science and Engineering Programs Being an NPB major myself I would like to see science majors involved in ASUCD. I would like to work with the Outreach Committee to develop more events and resources aimed toward the science and engineering community here at UC Davis. I would like to see more of the science based student body having a say in what happens in their student government, as well as science students being able to better take advantage of the resources available to them through ASUCD.

Parking Parking as always been an issue here at UC Davis. I want to continue working with TAPS to get the parking times in the campus parking lots changed from 10pm to 8pm. I believe this would help a great many students that may have late night classes but dont want to ride their bike in the dark and cant afford a UC Davis parking permit. As well as individuals that have late night meetings on campus. Lowering the parking time would be beneficial for all of the students and would cut down on the parking traffic in the city of Davis at night because of university students that need to get onto campus, but dont have a bike to ride at night.

CoHo Card The idea behind developing a CoHo Card is to save students money, while making the lines in the CoHo faster, by making the whole process more streamlined. The CoHo card will allow students or their parents to put money on their CoHo card online or in the CoHo and by using this card they can get a discount on various food and drink items through out the CoHo, much like the discounts given when using Aggie Cash.

Bike Safety I want to implement a program that will improve over all bike safety in the city of Davis. Bike lighting is a huge issue during the night in the city of Davis so I will improve bike safety by starting a bike light voucher program that will allow students to receive only a fixit ticket instead of an actual moving violation ticket. These students will then be able to take their copy of the ticket to the bike barn to receive a bike light and this will sign off their fixit ticket.

Student Fees As we all know student fees are getting out of hand, I know I can not keep student fees down by myself but I would like to keep advocating for lower student fees. I would work with Lobby Corps, the external advocacy unit of ASUCD, to make sure we all keep lobbying the Regents, the Office of the President, and at the California State Capitol for lower student fees. It is important not to give up and make sure they hear us, whether they decide to increase fees or not, we have to let the State and the UC know we are here and where we stand on this issue.
