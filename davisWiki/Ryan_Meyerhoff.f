 Candidate Statement from his Winter 2011 Senate race 

Hello fellow students.  I’m Ryan Meyerhoff – a 3rd year Political Science major.   You deserve a responsible government that can be held accountable to vote how you want your money spent.  Therefore, I hope to use my experience to bring an Independent voice to the ASUCD Senate.

My Platform:

FREE PARKING: I will work with the Transportation & Parking Administrative Advisory Committee and TAPS to get free parking on campus by 9PM instead of 10PM.

NO PICTURES ON BALLOTS: People should vote for qualifications, not appearances.

NO NEW FEES: I have spent 3 years fighting for lower fees on the Student Fee Advisory Committee to the Vice Chancellor. As a Senator, I will do my best to kill any new campusinitiated fees for our student body.

RESPONSIBILITY: The meat & potatoes of a Senator’s job lies in voting on bills and working on the ASUCD Budget.  I promise to scrutinize the budget to ensure responsible spending, vote on bills in a levelheaded manner, and work past partisan divides with the interest of the whole student body in mind.

EXPERIENCE: I am a veteran within your government, serving on the ASUCD Supreme Court, as Chair of the Elections Committee, and as a member of the Business and Finance Commission.  I’ll use my experience to cut red tape and ensure that students like you have an efficient and effective student government.

~~~ I know how good government works –  I recognize a good idea when I see one and will support the quality projects of fellow Senators, regardless of their slate.   I have been serving you since freshman year, so I know how to accomplish my goals.  I only ask that you allow me to continue serving the student body as your ASUCD Senator.  ~~~ Vote for Experience & Leadership.  Vote for Ryan Meyerhoff ~~~  Facebook me with your questions.
