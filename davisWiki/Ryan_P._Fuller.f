Fuller was responsible for the brutal murder of the Aggie The California Aggie: Spoof edition spoof edition for the year he was the EditorinChief.  It resumed the following year when the Aggie was under the direction of Daniel Stone.

Some of Fullers major accomplishments while EditorinChief include: a revamp of the interface of the Aggies website, giving it a more bloglike aesthetic; creation of the http://www.calaggieeditorsaward.com California Aggie Editors Award (website dead, but http://web.archive.org/web//http://www.calaggieeditorsaward.com/ archived), a $1000 scholarship for incoming Freshmen interested in Journalism; and the http://www.calaggienewsalumni.org/ California Aggie Newspaper Alumni Network, a keep in touch site for former California Aggie employees (now defunct).

Fuller also was responsible for the creation of the separate position of Opinion Editor.  The Opinion Editor was responsible for some of the duties previously reserved for the EditorinChief, such as managing Letters to the Editor, working with the opinion columnists, and helping to write editorials.  The position was filled by soontobe EditorinChief Daniel Stone.  Many felt the creation of this position, along with other factors, contributed to a more distant EditorinChief.  The position of Opinion Editor was removed the following year when Daniel Stone assumed the position of EditorinChief.
