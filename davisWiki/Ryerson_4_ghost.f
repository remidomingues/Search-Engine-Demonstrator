Throughout the 200506 school year, the residents of Ryerson Hall Ryerson 4 heard a mans voice saying hello quite often, sometimes up to six times in a period of ten minutes.  Nothing specialexcept that its an allfemale floor.

The exact source of the voice is unknown; it was heard mainly in rooms 424426 (although residents heard it in other rooms), in the hall, and in the bathroom.  The 0506 residents decided to blame it on a ghost, as they never found the culprit.

Users/KarinaSummers Karina Summers, who lived in Ryerson 422, brought up this issue in RHAB, to which she brought a recording of the voice.  The most logical explanation presented was that some idiot on the third floor was climbing on his bookcase, taking out the back panel, and shouting through it.

If anyone from the fourth floor hears the voice this year, please tell Karina so she can hunt for other logical explanations.

Other than the slight annoyance and confusion he instigated, the ghost caused no harm and actually appeared quite friendly.


Wow, this proves that there was no Ryerson 4 ghost after all! It was just Old Man Cratchit all along!
Yes, and I wouldve gotten away with it, too, if it werent for you meddling kids!
