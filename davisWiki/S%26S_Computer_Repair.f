20130222 14:58:13 nbsp This is a fantastic shop. Steve did an amazing job on my computer. I was having screen troubles and he was able to tell me what the problem was right away. His prices were fair if not good. Steve fixed my computer within a 24 hour window. What impressed me the most about S and S was the attention to detail and their customer service. When I received my computer back after being repaired, not only was the screen problem fixed but he had completely cleaned my laptop. A+ job! If you have a computer problem, do not hesitate to call up S and S. They do a fantastic job! Users/CaseyIrvin
