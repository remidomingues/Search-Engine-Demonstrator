Welcome the Solar Community Housing Association Board of Directors Meeting Agenda.  The meeting agendas are officially kept as word documents on our yahoo site.  To help make these documents transparent and easier to update, access and revise were trying out posting it here on the Wiki.  If this feels like a good idea, an inappropriate use of the wiki or you have any other feedback, please leave a comment!  This tries to reproduce our standard format as much as possible.
