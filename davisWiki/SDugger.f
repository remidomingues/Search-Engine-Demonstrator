I am a Davisite, having moved here at the age of 3. I remember when CVS Pharmacy was Longs, when SaveMart was Albertsons, an when there was a Ricos Pizza in the Oaktree Plaza.

I am a mother & a wife, and after moving to the bay area for a few years out of high school have returned to Davis area as the property manager of Pinecrest Apartments.

Im fairly new as a user to DavisWiki, but am eager to learn. I use it quite frequently to find out about community events, and utilize it as a resource for fun things to do in town. During the summer, youll often find me at the Farmers Market with my family.
