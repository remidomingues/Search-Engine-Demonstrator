SHARE UCD (which stands for Students Helping in Aftermath Relief and Education) is a service student organizations organization at UC Davis which works to raise awareness and provide relief and educational aid for victims of natural disasters, especially after media coverage and other relief efforts have dwindled.  Our goal is to recognize and act on the fact that the lives of disaster victims cannot move on as quickly as the media, and thus we strive to elicit continued support even after the spotlight dims.  A group of concerned UC Davis students founded SHARE in response to the tsunami disaster that struck Southeast Asia just over one year ago.  Last year, we raised over $10,000 to build a technologybased learning center for an orphanage in wiki:WikiPedia:Sri Lanka to provide education and a sustainable future to hundreds of youth affected by tsunami.


Events

This year, we will be hosting a Food and Wine Festival and Auction. The evening will consist of wine and a Cajunstyle dinner catered by Monticello Bistro, live entertainment, a collection of the finest wines from local wineries, and a wide assortment of auction items. Keynote speakers include the Chancellor of UC Davis, Larry Vanderhoef, and the Mayor of the city of Davis, Sue Greenwald.

All of the proceeds from the auction will be used to rebuild and replace parts of Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary School, which was destroyed by http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina Hurricane Katrina. SHARE will partner with Communities in Schools in order to aid MLK Jr. They need funds to renovate buildings, replace antiquated books, and make the changes necessary to build a new educational environment and help make New Orleans a home for students once again.
