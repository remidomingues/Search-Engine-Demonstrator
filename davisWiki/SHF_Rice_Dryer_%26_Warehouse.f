The SHF Rice Dryer and Warehouse is the cluster of big grain silos that can be seen on the western side of the Yolo Causeway, near the Yolo Fruit Stand.

Weird Fact: The dryer and warehouse here are actually owned and operated by wiki:WikiPedia:Dunes_(hotel_and_casino) Dunes Hotels & Casinos!  Well, a subsidiary of Dunes Hotels & Casinosthe SHF Acquisition Corporation.  After the famous Dunes Hotel was demolished in Las Vegas to make way for the wiki:WikiPedia:Bellagio_%28hotel_and_casino%29 Bellagio, the corporation behind the Dunes (ticker symbol http://www.portfolio123.com/stockinfo.jsp?ticker_uid2873 DUNE) apparently got into real estate with a sideline in agriculture.

This facility dries harvested rice over a twomonth period and stores, for a fee, the dried rice until it is removed (normally within the following year as the storage charges are paid for a 12month period).
