http://sisweb.ucdavis.edu Sisweb is the one stop place for registering for classes (with the help of the Class Schedule and Registration Guide and the General Catalog) and for your Financial Aid Office financial aid. It interfaces with the BANNER Student Information System.

It replaced the old RSVP phone registering system.

http://www.ninjacourses Ninja Courses lets you create hypothetical UC Davis schedules to decide what youre going to register for.

Users/KenBloom wrote some Users/KenBloom/OCL Perl scripts to make searching the http://registrar.ucdavis.edu/ocl/ open course list easy.



If youre a UCD student, odds are that SISWEB will piss you off at one point.

SISWeb is also frequently down along with MyUCDavis.  You can check the status of SISWeb at http://status.ucdavis.edu status.ucdavis.edu.
