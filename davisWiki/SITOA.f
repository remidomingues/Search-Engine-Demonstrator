There are a number of taxi services which are based outside of Davis but will give rides to the Sacramento Airport or between Davis and Sacramento.  The bulk of these are members of the Sacramento Taxi Association (STA) and/or the Sacramento Independent Taxi Owners Association (SITOA).  SITOA drivers have purchased one of a limited pool of medallions which give them the right to operate a cab in Sacramento.  The are also licensed (or should be) to do airport pickups/dropoffs.  Since its a bit of a drive for them to come to Davis, though, most wont do intraDavis rides.  Thats OK, though  there are a number of taxi services local options.
