Current UCD Senior majoring in International Agricultural Development, but specializing in Economic Development. Im far more at home in the ARE department than surrounded by HCD people (Brush and Momsen are notable exceptions). Which means Im not a hippie. Im possibly the only person in the entire department who thinks Neoliberal Economics is a good idea and that http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusto_Pinochet Augusto Pinochet got an unfair rap from history.

A former summer intern at the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_America_Foundation New America Foundation in Washington DC after having spent Spring Quarter in the University of California Washington Center Program UCDC Program. Too po to live in the nice bits, I lived in the neighborhood of Petworth, charitably described as the front lines of gentrification. I lived in a basement and shared a room with a 5 foot 6 inch South Asian NeoTrotskyist who occasionally helped me fend off the cockroaches. My only goals were to avoid getting shot and to not screw up too badly at work. Both of which I achieved.

The only reasons that Im not a Republican are Christians and the past seven years. That said, I voted for Obama.

I have random hobbies; Im currently obsessed with keeping tabs on university construction.

20080723 20:30:17 nbsp Hey, cool edits  I finally got caught up on the Recent Changes, and you really did gangbusters today!   Welcome to the wiki! Users/JabberWokky

20080724 00:44:42 nbsp I didnt have that problem at Americana Arms, but I had ok credit to begin with. They are actually starting to get really anal here, and I am not liking it. I first moved here last september, and renewed my lease cause I couldnt find anywhere else cheaper to live for a 1 bedroom apartment. But I wouldnt advise it. It is quite small for the price, the kitchen sucks, the internet is not the greatest (and there are bandwidth limits that they obviously dont advertise)... If you have any questions on the apartment complex, Id be more than willing to answer. Welcome to the wiki, and you and ur boyfriend are a cute couple :) Users/BrandonBarrette

20080724 10:06:02 nbsp Its not too bad, but it could be better. Im stuck here for one more year too, then Im moving outta here! Users/BrandonBarrette

20080725 15:43:08 nbsp I also have a slight obsession with keeping tabs on university construction. ;) Users/JeremyOgul

20080730 22:40:21 nbsp Minor anecdote based on a comment you made elsewhere in the wiki: I officiated one of the San Francisco marriages (during the brief time they were being issued) during the preshow of Rocky Horror at UC Davis campus.  (Ive actually performed a few wedding ceremonies over the years). A couple had gotten their license and headed to Sacramento to protest and stopped at the show on the way back.  They came up afterwards and thanked me, one of them in tears.  Among several other couples (the rest of whom I know well), Ive been thinking about them while following the recent news in the past months, and I hope they are now officially recognized as spouses.

20080905 08:27:40 nbsp Hey, check out the comment regarding the image on Martin Yan.  Also, a brief read through of Copyrights is a good idea. Normally Id give you a gentle and simplified introduction, but you seem intelligent enough to just read the boring stuff and grasp it. :)  In general, most people will give you permission if you just ask.

20080909 19:37:25 nbsp Hey, S... I cleaned up the UC Davis Olive Center entry like you asked.  Much of that kind of boring stuff is available prebuilt in the templates.  If you create an entry using a template, you can just fill in the blanks for much of the stuff, plus it prompts you to look up the useful info (like location and phone number) that people might be looking for on the wiki.  Great entry, by the way... the content is whats important; dressing it up just makes it look pretty. Users/JabberWokky

20080911 07:17:42 nbsp The One Shields Avenue address isnt a real address.  Or it is, but it does not have an actual physical location.  It means that the group either doesnt have a physical location or that they dont have a mailing address at that location.  One Shields is basically the virtual mailroom for the University.  Presumably the Olive group has a location, but it isnt One Shields.  Since they will have a new facility, the One Shields is probably just a temporary address so they can get mail. Users/JabberWokky

20090126 00:43:58 nbsp Hey there. The music building already has a wiki page (Music Building), so Ill delete the New one. Users/robinlaughlin

20090218 14:16:36 nbsp hey man, I saw ur comment on the UCCS page. I am considering applying for the program this summer. Is it worth it? \ thanks for your help. Users/DanielHan

20090222 22:39:29 nbsp Thanks for the response! So I understand you did both the UCCS and Washington program? also, what internship were you involved with in sacramento? Users/DanielHan

20090731 00:45:00 nbsp Hey, given your recent obsession, did you ever run across anything about The Museum of Art at UC Davis? Users/JabberWokky
