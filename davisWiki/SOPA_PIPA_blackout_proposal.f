Should we black out davis wiki tomorrow in opposition to SOPA / PIPA?  Wikipedias http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/English_Wikipedia_antiSOPA_blackout announced theyre blacking out (shutting down) all of English Wikipedia on Wednesday to protest SOPA/PIPA, which changes the game quite a bit.  Should we participate in a sitewide blackout?



I favor a days blackout still.  Show solidarity.  Its good for the Internet.  JT
 Agreed 100%.  SOPA is a bit of legislative insanity.  Anything that brings attention to that fact is a good thing in my mind. Users/TomGarberson
  I would like a fair amount of support before doing this (or any other similar wikiwide act), but yes: it would be a good idea. jw

Lets do it.  Users/WilliamLewis

Its certainly a vital matter.  I just would like to hear opinions on Twitters nonparticipatory stance. Users/BruceHansen
  How would that relate to our decision? jw
  My understanding is that Twitter will be participating in some form tomorrow, though not a blackout.  Similarly, Google will be participating with a link on their home page. Users/PhilipNeustrom

20120117 19:53:38 nbsp Agree.  Do it. Users/EdWins

20120117 20:35:05 nbsp Most definitely, & Im terrified of a day without the internet, so thats a big definitely. :) Users/Davidlm

20120117 21:02:59 nbsp Wikipedia has gone black.  As has Google.  Seems they used United States East Coast, which makes sense given the fact that its the US Congress. Users/JabberWokky

20120117 21:21:49 nbsp I cant say Im in favor of blacking out.  Do we do this for EVERY Internetbased bill that comes up around the globe now?  The precedent being set here is not good for the internet.  At what proposal do we NOT show solidarity then?  A discussion for afterwards, yes, it is too late now with the consensus of the admins...but it is a good question to think about during the blackout: how far is too far?   Users/JeffWood

20120117 21:22:37 nbsp Im in favor of the blackout.  Users/SimonFung

20120117 23:10:21 nbsp in favor. Users/MeggoWaffle

20120117 23:19:55 nbsp Ive seen the Wikipedia and Google pages.  (Dont see anything on Twitter yet.)  I think all of these actions from various sites will have an impact, and thats perhaps my biggest consideration.  Yes!  Join in together with the others! Users/BruceHansen
