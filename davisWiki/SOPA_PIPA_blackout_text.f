This page is for drafting what visitors to daviswiki.org will see tomorrow if we participate in a blackout.

What we need:
    Consensus on a blackout.  That discussion is Wiki Community/SOPA PIPA blackout proposal here
    Text for the blackout page.
    HTML for the blackout page.  http://mathburritos.org/dwiki_test.html Draft (There were two, but they converged on each others changes.  This is the collaborative result).

(text was removed to keep this concise).


http://mathburritos.org/dwiki_test.html Heres a current HTML draft  please help!  JW, Im worried your text is too long.  I think we have to keep it very short, at least at the top prior to a video / take action link.  We can have longer text below that.  Im taking a break from this for a couple hours, but Ill be back  anyone that can, please help with the HTML / text!   Users/PhilipNeustrom

http://www.cheshirehall.net/link/a/12.01.17.21.31.49.html Heres my version done up.  I wrote it as a starting point.  I would hope that the wiki community would help rewrite it and make it better.  Im also amused that, for a site that is composed of large bodies of text, that you would be worried that theres too much of what people come here to read.   I am avoiding putting a video directly on the page, as quite a few people dont like their only option for more information to be a video, but I am linking to a video, an infographic and more text, so as to appeal to whatever form of information the visitor feels most comfortable with.  ⁓Users/JabberWokky ʝ⍵
 I dont think this is too long. And thank you for not embedding a blob of flash into the page.  Users/WilliamLewis

Ive updated the http://mathburritos.org/dwiki_test.html test page here to JWs layout / text, with some minor changes.  Itd be good to get a couple of sample images of people.  Anyone want to take the first one? (Id do it but Arlens got my camera) Because the wiki will be down, please collaborate in #daviswiki on freenode tomorrow!  The page doesnt have to be perfect  we can update it throughout the day.

Unless there are any objections, Ill flip the switch at midnight and set daviswiki.org to 503 and display the blackout page.  Ive added a link at the bottom of the page to join JWs IRC room so folks can collaborate and suggest changes to the blackout page throughout the day.  Users/PhilipNeustrom
   I updated mine with some convergences.  Im leaving out the Davis Wiki logo intentionally, and leaving in the longer text.  The logo is off because it focuses the issue squarely on free speech in Davis rather than a website.  It is already pretty clear it is a website.  On the flip side, the longer text paragraph that you removed is important because if any press or outsiders visit, they may be unfamiliar with the wiki.  This gives them context in case they report (either tweet or write an actual published articles) about the site being blacked out. jw
     The main reason for including the logo is that a lot of people may otherwise think the site is completely broken or hacked :P
       Yeah, I thought of that, but I didnt think it was needed.  I see both pros and cons, so Im happy with it there. I see you brought in the css changes.  Im on IRC. jw
   Oh, and good new link  thats a better tool than the one I had been using.  A brief thought: the longer text could be collapsed under a header.  AFK fora short bit for dinner, but this can be updated after it goes live. jw


I just added an event to the events page for wednesday that seems relevant. law school talk about internet freedom from 45pm at king hall. might be worth a mention since everybodys internet will be broken tomorrow. angel.york

   Great catch!  Ive added it to the page!  Users/PhilipNeustrom
    Go, team, go! Users/DougWalter

So,  who all sent mail,  called,  etc?  jw
 I sent a response regarding the text via Feedback.  I didnt think it was received and didnt pursue it. bh
   Wait, did you write your Congressperson or did you just email the wiki?   jw
    Sorry, I misunderstood your question.  I put my name etc. in a form;  I was hoping they would direct it to my representaives according to my zip code.  Also signed an online petition, made some posts on Facebook encouraging others to do something. bh
