The UC Davis Ski or Snowboard Club, more commonly referred to as SOS, is the largest social club on campus. The purpose behind SOS is to get skiers and snowboarders up to the snow for as cheap as possible, and of course to have a great time in the process.  The Student Organizations club has ranged anywhere from 200800 members in past decades, though currently it hosts around 450 members along with 6 officers and 11 staffers.  Besides scoring its members huge savings, SOS is known for their wild parties and unique Drinking games drinking games.

Membership is $30. This fee scores you an SOS tshirt and a membership that will earn you tons of Living Cheaply great discounts around Davis town (Woodstocks Pizza Woodstocks, Kens Bike & Ski, Ground Zero, etc.).  Members are also able to attend all SOS events (All Cal, Cabin trips, Broomball, Float trip, etc...) for free or at a largely discounted price compared to nonmembers.  We host an annual Members Only sale night at Ground Zero, in which only members gain access to the store with items up to 80% off! (As well as many other useful discounts around Davis!) If you have a yearning to go to the snow but have no car to get yourself there, SOS also organizes carpools for all of our trips!  Being an SOS member also gives you full access to our Members only parties also known as Ragers.
