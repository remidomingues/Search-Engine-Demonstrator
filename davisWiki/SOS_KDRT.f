 Save Our Station KDRT 

  KDRT, a local lowpower radio station (101.5 FM) is facing loss of its frequency. Recently enacted FCC regulations make it easier for fullpower stations to relocate, resulting in a commercial station’s plans to move from Yuba County to Woodland. According to station organizers, the move could force KDRT off the air and will entail a complicated process of petitioning the FCC for another frequency. “At a minimum, we believe we are looking at $1520k in legal and engineering fees to fight this,” said Jeff Shaw, KDRT station director. ”KDRT’s entire budget is less than $25k per year. We’re truly a grassroots station.” Community businesses and volunteers have stepped up to begin fundraising.





KDRT is a project of Davis Media Access (DMA), which also operates public access channel 15 on the Comcast cable system in Davis. KDRT is largely volunteer driven, and community supporters are stepping up to drive this campaign, said Diane Crumley, a DMA board member and cochair of SAVE KDRT.

“We’ve had emergency meetings with programmers to organize, and they are excited about finding creative ways to get the message out and raise money,” Crumley said. “The larger community’s response to this been amazing. People are incensed and eager to help.”

Crumley also said that fundraising efforts are under way. The Davis Food Coop, a business underwriter for KDRT since 2004, launched a donation campaign at its registers. A flyer describes the situation and encourages shoppers to donate to the radio station’s legal and engineering costs. The Coop has pledged up to $1k in matching funds.

KDRT programmer and local promoter Brendan Boyle organized a benefit concert for Sunday, April 8, 2007 at the Delta of Venus in Davis. Local acts Ben Lewis, Patrick Ferris, Doug Kauffman, Chief Briggum, Ol’ Snakey’s Bluejass Ramblers, G2 and Katie Delwiche performed. The event was free, but the musicians and Delta of Venus staff donated all tips that evening to KDRT.  More information and a schedule is available at www.kdrt.org.

Crumley added that volunteers will table at Farmer’s Market and Picnic Day, among other places, and will also launch a funding appeal in midApril.  All are welcome and encouraged to get involved.

“We are very grateful for our community’s support and hope to sustain this momentum,” Crumley said. “To lose this community resource would be unthinkable.”

The proposed KMJE broadcasting tower is not in Woodland, but just outside of Davis (much closer to Davis, in fact) in county lands, the editorial makes it sound as if there is an open frequency that KDRT can move to, when there isnt. And finally, it implies that KMJE was immediately accomodating to KDRT, when in fact, no one from Results Radio contacted anyone at KDRT until after KDRT and the news media found out about their application. Station Manager Jeff Shaw wrote a letter to the editor to the Aggie to correct theese mistakes, however, the Aggie has not printed it. Several attempts to get a hold of the Editor in Chief failed.
