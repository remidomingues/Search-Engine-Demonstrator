20100603 18:09:07 nbsp xPhilip renamed the page about Kari, rather than deleting it.  Jasons link has the latest version.  You can also go to any deleted page and click on the info button at the top to bring up the change log for the page.  You can compare versions to see individual edits, or just view it at a certain point.x Philips wikifu puts mine to shame.  Too slow!
