STAGES has been developed to be an extension of the educational process, where children, teens and even adults can benefit greatly from the creative arts.  Along with mental & physical challenges, we hope to be able to stimulate memory, and provides discipline and camaraderie.

Our standards and expectations are high, and we will make every effort to maintain an environment which is secure, encouraging, and supportive.

The goal of STAGES is to offer classes in which the comfort level and the feeling of success and accomplishment are high and the possibilites are endless!

Please take your time and get familiar with STAGES and the website, and check the current schedule for new and added classes!
