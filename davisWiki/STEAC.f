 Holiday Donation Programs 
Though donations are appreciated during any time of the year, STEAC operates a large holiday donation program (see their website) popular within the Davis community, campus community, and among local residents in need. The STEAC program matches local families to community members/groups; donors are provided with ages of their adopted family members, along with a holiday gift wish list and a grocery shopping list that includes a request for money to purchase perishables.  Family sizes can range from one to eight or more members  donors should indicate if they are capable of providing for a larger family.  STEAC distributes donations around midDecember. To adopt a family, call (530) 7588435 or email steac@steac.org.

STEAC also coordinates an annual Can Tree Holiday Food Drive. This program is cosponsored by Davis Post Office Employees and the Yolo County Association of Realtors. Residents are asked to help fill the organizations food closet for the holidays by leaving canned foods out for curbside pickup by volunteers. Requested items include peanut butter, jelly, canned fruit, canned vegetables, tomato sauce/paste, cooking oil, juice, and cereals; STEAC requests that donors not leave broths, exotic foods or expired items.

 Volunteer Program 
STEAC is always looking for volunteers to fill food, clothing, and gift requests. Individuals are needed for office help as well as to answer the STEAC access line.

They currently do not take furniture donations.  They had a rental space they were using for storage that they couldnt afford anymore.  They plan to get it back soon, so if you do want to donate furniture, give them a call.  Dont dump it, put it to good use!  The lady on the phone was extremely nice and helpful (and appreciative).  She gave me the numbers for Salvation Army because they can come and pick it up, and for Goodwill who might pick it up.  Users/Edwins ES
