Hello students of Science and Technology Studies, Anthropology, Biology,
Philosophy, Chemistry, History, Computer Science or any of the other
disciplines of the sciences, social sciences, and/or humanities!

Do you have interests that cross the realms of science and other
domains such as art or the social sciences?

Have you ever wanted to know where what we know comes from and how it is
that we came to know it?

Would you like to meet other people with as diverse interests as you and
with whom you can share ideas and experiences from your respective
backgrounds and fields of study?

Then be among the first on our campus to bring together students from the
sciences, social sciences, and humanities in the new Science and Technology
Studies Club!

Prospective activities include:

  Touring laboratories on campus  We attend one of the top research
 institutions in the country and have a unique opportunity to see how
 discoveries are made and how new knowledge is formed in various disciplines!

  Viewing films that encourage thought about how science and technology have
 shaped our culture and imagination

  Socializing with awesome students from diverse academic backgrounds with
 varied interests

If youre interested, attend one of our meetings! At our upcoming meeting,
this Thursday evening (Jan 17) at 6:10pm in Wellman Hall Wellman 203, we will be
discussing what labs we would like to visit on campus and what films to
view this quarter.  Hope to see you there!
