Welcome to the Wiki Howdy, Ms. EET, and Welcome to the Wiki!   You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you (or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here, and it would be kind of odd if you walked around Davis introducing yourself as SUHHHWEEEEEEET, not to mention that it doesnt fit on those My Name Is tags).  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for creating the Little Sis entry... fantastic work, and you might want to add a link to it from the  Psi Chi Omega entry so people reading that can learn a bit about it and then visit the Little Sister entry.  Once again, welcome to the wiki!  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20100720 13:42:02 nbsp Good afternoon, and how are you?  The Psi Chi Omega Lil Sis page is not yours.  I understand that you put the page up, but the wiki is community run and therefore owned.  Every edit, and bit of information you add helps create a first tier resource for people seeking information about Davis, and that means all of that information belongs to everybody as soon as you post it.  I understand there are some concerns regarding privacy, and while I think the names should stay I also sympathize with not wanting your name up someplace that you have no control over it. People We are discussing options, and you are welcome to join in and contribute your view point on the situation.  Matters would be helped if you were using your Importance of using your realname RealName because it gives you an instant Identity with some credit.   Users/MasonMurray
