 SaDaFuego 

SaDa (SAcramento  DAvis) Fuego started off as a community effort to bring fire dancers together in the Sacramento Valley area by hosting weekly practices.  SaDa Fuego was a professional fire troupe that performed at various burns and events.  You may have recognized many members from Whole Earth Festival burns.

SaDa coordinated with the Damento Jugglers and arranged practices on campus.  They met every Thursday from 69 pm on the quad near the footpath.

Typical props used were poi, meteors, hoops, staffs, fire fans, and juggling torches.

Live near by? Interested in meeting up for a local practice/burn? Get in touch with the Davis fire community through http://tribes.tribe.net/fireuniversity F.ire U.niversity as SaDa Fuego no longer has practices in Davis.
