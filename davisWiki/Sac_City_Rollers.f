http://www.saccityrollers.com Sac City Rollers are an allwomens flat track roller derby team of 50+ ladies from Sacramento, Davis, and beyond ranging in ages from 19 to 50. They train for part of the week, and have monthly bouts (games) against teams from all over California, in Sacramento at http://www.foothillskateinn.com/ Foothill Skate Inn. Theyve been featured in SN&R and local TV news.  Their reffing staff includes Johnny Rainbow and Professor Cyanide Clyde, who are both UC Davis grad students.

Red Red Holiday Invitational is their annual charity tournament, to be held in Woodland at the http://www.norcalindoorsports.com/ NISC this year.

For schedules, practice times, or more information on the Sac City Rollers, visit  their websites.  SCR is always looking for a few more volunteers to help us at bouts and fundraisers. If you are interested in being part of the fastestgrowing sport in the nation, contact us about training to become a Referee or Statistician.
