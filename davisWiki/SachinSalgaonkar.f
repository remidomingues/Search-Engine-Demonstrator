Hi everyone! My name is Sachin Salgaonkar and I am a third year Mathematics math major at UC Davis. This summer (from July to September 2012), I will be working with Professor De Loera on a mathematical research project in a NSFfunded REU focused on linearization and optimization.

Im not sure what else to write here, but I will occasionally update this page when I decide what to put up here.
