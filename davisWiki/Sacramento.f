Sacramento is Californias state capitol, a bustling city just 15 miles east of Davis and a stones throw across the Sacramento River from West Sacramento. Its in Sacramento County.

Sacramento suffers many nicknames, including SacTown, Sacacemento, Sackatomatoes, Sack Toe, Excremento, Sock Town, Suckramento, Suck Pimento, NutSacramento, The Big Tomato, and The River City.

Geographically, the city anchors the greater Sacramento region, which includes the counties of wiki:sacramento:Sacramento_County Sacramento , Placer, El Dorado, Sutter, Yolo County Yolo and Yuba. The city also provides a meeting point for the Sacramento River Sacramento and American Rivers, with the former defining the citys western periphery; these and other major rivers drain into the Sacramento Valley.

Flooding is the areas most significant natural hazard (see Yolo Bypass)  and simultaneously gives Sacramento great control over state water issues. Air Pollution is another result of the citys lowlying orientation.

UC Davis is a state land grant college and the UC campus in closest proximity to our state capitol. A significant percentage of its student body hails from the Sacramento region, with 10% claiming Sacramento and 4% claiming Yolo as their home counties (http://why.ucdavis.edu/facts_figures.cfm source). UC Davis has a Sacramento campus a short distance southeast of downtown which is home to the UC Davis Medical Center.

For entertainmentstarved college students, Sacramento is seen as a nearby watering hole, with many excellent Sacramento Restaurants restaurants and wiki:sacramento:bars and nightclubs in abundance. It also provides a wealth of diversity not found within either the City of Davis or UCD campus.

Many Ethnic Markets ethnically diverse products and services can be found in Sacramento that are either far more expensive in Davis or simply unavailable.

Sacramento also provides Spiritual Organizations places of worship for those who do not adhere to major European religions.

  Music Scene 
 Seewiki:sacramento:Music Scene
 Sacramento has a very exciting music scene that is still underrated. Many bands left the Bay Area during the 90s as rent went through the roof, and cheap recording studios closed down to make way for more apartments. In Sacramento upandcoming bands can find plenty of venues, cheap recordings studios, and plenty of artists.
  http://www.arcoarena.com/ ARCO Arena  The closest big arena.
  http://www.boardwalkrocks.com/boardwalk.php4 The Boardwalk  Actually located in Orangevale, but close enough to Sacramento, this venue is popular among high school aged students. However, they do have a bar, and occasionally someone really great will play a show there.
  http://www.capitolgarage.com/ The Capitol Garage  Lots of indie shows and local music. They recently relocated, however, and may have changed a bit.  Known changes:  they are now 21+ and have some sort of deal with wiki:WikiPedia:Clear_channel Clear Channel.  Drinks are expensive (wells$5.50!), but happy hour after ?4pm?.  Excellent sandwiches but pricey ($67).
  http://www.thecrest.com/ The Crest Theatre  In addition to being a place to see some great Movie Theaters movies, this place also hosts live music. Because it is filled with theater seats, it makes a great venue for seeing those kinds of bands where you just want to sit back, relax, and take in the music. (see also Crest Theater)
  http://www.empireeventscenter.com/events.asp Empire Events Center  Pretty fancy club for mostly indie acts. It is quite spacious with 5 bars. Shows are 18+, but are pretty strict about drinkingthey stamp you with blacklight ink and you must be 21+ to enter the fenced off drinking area. There are no drinking allowed outside this area.
  http://www.theoldironsides.com/ Old Ironsides  Good local music and smaller touring acts.
  http://www.westcoastworldwide.com/wcww/ West Coast World Wide run by Mike of the http://www.mikeyhood.com/ Hoods
  http://www.WestonHouseRecording.com Weston House Recording  A recording studio that is actually in Orangevale just down the street from The Boardwalk.
