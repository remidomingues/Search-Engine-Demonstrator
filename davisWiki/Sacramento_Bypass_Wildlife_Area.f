The Sacramento Bypass Wildlife Area is a small spot of open space public land close to the city. Its pretty bleak there in the dry season, but in the Winter and Spring wet seasons it undoubtedly has more town wildlife wildlife. When the Sacramento River rises to flood stage excess water is allowed to flow through Sacramento Weir (see photo) along the entire eastern edge of the wildlife area. Water then flows through the Sacramento Bypass Wildlife Area and on into the larger Yolo Bypass.
