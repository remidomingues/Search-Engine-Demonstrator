Sacramento Cafe was one of Davis earliest restaurants. It was opened around 1920 by a Chinese immigrant named Louie Young. Although Louie only understood a little English, the menu consisted almost entirely of standard American diner foods; the exception was their chop suey, which only some customers knew about. Louie and his family continued to run Sacramento Cafe until some point in the 1940s or early 50s..

The original building still exists, in a somewhat modified form, as the southern half of Woodstocks Pizza.
