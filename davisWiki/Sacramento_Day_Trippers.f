Day Trippin’
Meet Sacramento’s King of Day Trips: Grady O’Bryant

Grady O’Bryant never flies solo. Part travel junkie, part entrepreneur, part social butterfly, he’s helped thousands of people get out of their houses and their shells to explore new places together.

“I just love getting people together for travel. Everything’s more fun as a group. Plus, with someone else handling the details, people can just relax and enjoy the journey.”

Always on the lookout for new ways to help people enjoy themselves, O’Bryant created Sacramento Day Trippers in 2008 to take advantage of the city’s proximity to “the good life”. The group’s 2,100 members have enjoyed tours of wine country, San Francisco, Lake Tahoe, Half Moon Bay and other locations in Northern California. He recently took over 130 members on a day trip to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Upcoming trips include festivals such as the Gilroy Garlic Festival and Fillmore Jazz Festival, Oakland A’s and Raiders games, plays in San Francisco, a Lake Tahoe Cruise, and more.

Sacramento Wine & Nightlife Tours and Sacramento Day Trippers sacdaytrips.com are wildly popular with people wanting to relax while someone else does the driving, and are an economical way to do so, thanks to great group rates.  Trips are adultonly, giving those with or without children some quality downtime with their peers, and tend to attract a nice mix of folks in the 25 to 65 yearold age range.
