When Davisites need a palate refresher, Sacramento is often the destination of choice. With its larger, more diverse community, the capitol city offers a broad range of cuisines that are sometimes seen as more authentic than Davis offerings. To check if a Sacramento restaurant has had any health violations, you can look up its http://www.foodinspect.saccounty.net/ASP%20Pages/InitiateSearch.asp restaurant inspection reports online. Some Upscale Restaurants of note are in town. (You could also travel to West Sacramento, Woodland Restaurants Woodland, Dixon Restaurants Dixon, Vacaville Restaurants Vacaville, Winters Restaurants Winters... or just head home to Restaurants Davis).

I personally recommend PF Changs, Thai Basil, Hamburger Marys, Ricks Dessert Diner (2322 K St.) awesome diner atmosphere and seven layer cakes (mmm) and Mikuni Sushi to name a few  Users/KristenBirdsall

Users/JaimeRaba jrs favorites: Tapa the World (Spanish tapas), Firehouse (fancy steak/seafood/california), Marika (hungarian food), Elephant Bar, Fox and Goose Pub (British food), Buca di Beppo (the best for a big group.) Random cheap(er) eats: Spaghetti Factory (good for big groups), Gold Rush Grille (2nd floor of Secretary of States officeâ€”amazingly good however), Rubios (awesome Bajastyle fish Tacos)

Users/RobRoy Suggests Adalbertos Mexican Foods. It is damn good. Its so good the doorway might as well have an ISN Agent. And they are so authentic they dont even have a website. Users/JabberWokky seconds the suggestion and adds that Adalberto owns several restaurants in the greater Sacramento area and that his wife, Carolina, has a few too (named after her), which are equally good (and remarkably similar). They are all tiny and authentic with cheap and very very good food.

I loved Zeldas Original Gourmet Pizza.  This place serves up pizza that you really cant get in Davis!  Its delicious!  I also like P.F. Changs China Bistro PF Changs, but it does have a about to go to a club atmosphere.  Tres Hermanas is great, too. Users/PhilipNeustrom

Users/AmandaIrish, a genuine Sacramentan, suggests the following: El Novillero (4216 Franklin)the best sitdown restaurant Mexican youll get in Sacto.the portions are enormous and the salsa is AMAZING, Taste of Thai (1628 Broadway), Celestins (Cajun1815 K St.), Rio City Cafe (American1110 Front Street in Old Sacto.), and Zinfandel Grille (American2384 Fair Oaks).  With the exception of El Novillero and Taste of Thai (plates around $78), the others are a little pricier but definitely worth it if you want to escape the pedestrian Davis options.

20050815 22:52:04 nbsp The best chinese is always at the most ghetto holeinthewall restaurant.  Forget PF Changs and try the Beef w/ Green Chow Fun at Lai Wah.  Youll be going back for more. Users/WayneHuang

20060813 19:19:18 nbsp I went to eat at Hot Rods Burgers last night to find a blueuniformed security guard standing outside.  I asked him what the deal was (there were security guards similar to him standing outside of nearly every restaurant) and he said that its the law in Sacramento for all places serving alcohol to have a licensed security guard standing outside.  It seemed unnecessary and ridiculous to me (though, he was nothing but polite and helpful).  What were we going to do, throw hot dogs at each other?  Anyone have more details? Users/PhilipNeustrom

20070308  If youre ever in the Truxel and 80 shopping area in Natomas and want a quick bite, I recommend Andys Original DP Barbecue  http://dpbbqsauce.com/menu.htm at Truxel and Arena Blvd.  It BBQ foodribs, chicken, triptip, etc. and their BBQ sauce is AWESOME.  Its the type of place where you order at the counter, sit down, and wait for your food to come.  The place seems very new (like all the other places in that area) and has a mom and pop feel to it.  The lady who serves the food is really cool and nice too.  Maybe thats why I liked it so much.  Actually, if you frequent that shopping area, I recommend foregoing the typical chain restaurants and check out any of the locally owned places further up Truxel (closer to Arco). YupYup
