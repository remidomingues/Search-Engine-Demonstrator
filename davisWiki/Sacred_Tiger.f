20110202 19:28:37 nbsp Both George and Sergio are AWESOME! My roommate and I have gotten tattoos from both of them and their work is immaculate. Ive gotten tattoos from other places and been really uncomfortable with the tattoo artists, but George and Sergio take the time to make you feel at ease and like youre among friends. Sacred Tiger is the nicest shop Ive seen in this area for sure. You can tell how dedicated Sacred Tiger is to the tattoo community and that both artists have a passion for what they do. Both my roommate and I are DEFINITELY going back. :) Users/ChristineHo

20110513 13:38:17 nbsp Sergio is in my opinion the best at script that Davis has to offer : ) Users/dnm12

20110522 22:53:51 nbsp I went today and Brent was really helpful! A friend recommended I come here, and it was definitely the right choice. When I want another tattoo done, especially one that is highly detailed and intricate, I will certainly come here. All of the tattoo artists there were really nice and supportive, as were the other customers. Just FYI, its cash only.  Users/AllieF

20110714 15:06:47 nbsp I enthusiastically recommend George Hernandez and Sacred Tiger shop.

The shop is clean, well organized, with a friendly and nice atmosphere. They have also a good selection of books, that can be a source of inspiration if you dont have a clear idea of the style you are looking for.

George has a solid knowledge of traditional Japanese art, that he is able to reinterpret with elegance and care for details. He tattooed a half sleeve for me and I couldnt be more happy about his work. I have had several tattoos done by other artists and I can certainly say that the work done by Sacred Tiger shop was one of the best Ive had.

I also think the price is fair and it is what you should pay for a good piece of art.

20110721 12:58:52 nbsp Sacred Tiger has some of the best artists in town. George and Sergio do amazing work! The shop is clean, has a great vibe and everyone is super friendly. If your thinking about your next tattoo stop in and chat it over with any of their artist and youll be glad you made the trip.  Users/KayceM

20110912 10:48:13 nbsp Gabe did an amazing job on a couple red roses I had added underneath a skull. The style is great, the color is bright and the placement around the skull is perfect. Id definitely recommend these guys to anyone and I will be going back to Sacred Tiger for future tattoos. Great guys... and a big thanks to Gabe for the work he did.  Users/AlliePrather

20111114 01:01:52 nbsp Mike the destroyer just kidding! is new, and he is awesome!! He spent the time to draw out a script tattoo for me, and added his own flair which I loved. He was super nice and talented, and didnt mind when my friends were playing paparazzi and documenting every moment. ( The price is right, the artists are friendly and talented, the place looks clean and inviting..I think I found the place to recommend everyone to go to in Davis. Users/verenakwan

20120225 22:37:30 nbsp I was TERRIFIED to get my first tattoo. I waited 15 yrs to get a tiny symbol on my wrist tonight. After seeing Sergios breathtaking portfolio, I cant wait for more work!  I recommend Sergio 100%. He patiently listened to my nervous jabber. The minimum is 60 which is reasonable. AND the other artist were friendly.  Definately recommend Sacred Tiger! Users/TheDavisPerkins

20120316 21:55:52 nbsp Got a piece done by Sergio that was a bit of a coverup and a bit of a complete redo. He did an amazing job on it, and Im definitely coming back to him for anything new I want! Everyone in the shop is awesome, they really make a point to make you feel comfortable. Highly recommended. Users/cjwilcox

20120323 11:01:38 nbsp MONEY MIKE! Hes amazing. First, he freehand sketched my owl tattoo  he put so much detail into it. His work is incredibly precise; he took his time and worked every last detail into my tattoo. My finished tattoo is better than anything I had in mind.
On top of doing incredible work, all of the guys at the shop are awesome in general. Easygoing and so fun to talk to  which is good if youre there for a few hours getting work done.
Best tattoo shop around. I wouldnt go anywhere else.  Users/AlliePrather

20120323 18:50:31 nbsp Got a tattoo yesterday done by Mike (pretty sure that was his name.. his desk is in the front on the right of the shop. anyway, ive been to Urban body and primary concepts (multiple times) for tattoos, but so far, this is my favorite out of all 8 tattoos i have) SO much effort and detail went into a beautiful rose piece he did on my arm.  Honestly makes the other artists work look preeeety shitty cuz its so nice. I LOVE IT> &&&& only costed $100! he worked almost 3 hours on it too! At urban body i got two pieces done and it took 1 hr total and was $200. I could just tell way more effort was put into the one i got here. I by far recommend this place over all other tattoo shops in davis. BEST WORK AND AFFORDABLE!! go to MIKE/guy at front of shop on right. ^^ Users/MarissaMie

20120410 17:15:55 nbsp Mike gave my girlfriend and I our first tattoo. He is incredibly talented and I am now heading back for more. Great, friendly and helpful staff! Users/Joelgossett

20120806 20:54:59 nbsp I walked in to get a tattoo done on a Saturday evening and Mile had no problem taking me without an appointment. He also spent a good amount of time personalizing the picture I brought in to make sure I got exactly what I wanted. My tattoo turned out GREAT!!!! It was very reasonably priced and Mike was awesome to work with! I will definitely head back here when Im ready for my next one! Users/KathleenIvie

20120930 12:13:59 nbsp Just got a tattoo from George last weekend. I got the Philadelphia Eagles logo and I love the interpretation of it that George made for the tattoo. Phenomenal tattoo, great price, George is excellent. I will be going back to him for some more work. I highly, highly recommend this place! George is awesome. Users/BigJay
