The http://safeparty.ucdavis.edu/ Safe Party Initiative was launched on http://www.news.ucdavis.edu/search/news_detail.lasso?id7481 Sept. 27, 2005
 What is the Safe Party Initiative? 
The Safe Party Initiative (SPI) aims to reduce problems related to college student drinking at parties in the Davis community. It focuses on creating safer party environments by building a closer sense of community between students and neighbors, promoting safety at parties and increasing enforcement of alcoholrelated laws and policies. This initiative is a collaborative effort between the City of Davis and the University of California, Davis.

The comprehensive initiative arose from an initial fiveyear, $6.9 million study of alcoholrelated problems at 14 California universities, funded by the National Institute for Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse (NIAAA). UC Davis was one of seven intervention campuses asked by the Prevention Research Center to develop a coordinated campus community strategy for reducing highrisk drinking and the problems it creates. The research project seeks to reduce violence, property damage, injury and car crashes that result from highrisk drinking and outofcontrol parties.
