The Safety & Parking Commission (SPAC) is one of several City Commissions that advise the City Council on ways to improve existing accident prevention programs or implement new programs in order to reduce untimely deaths, crippling injuries and economic losses caused by accidents.  They also review and makes recommendations on traffic safety proposals and parking issues. SPAC is also charged with making recommendations to the City Council on matters relating to pedestrian and auto safety, including such items as speed limits and appropriate regulatory warning devices.

Any resident who lives within Davis city limits may apply for a four year appointment to this commission during the summer of evennumbered years and when other vacancies occur.

http://www.davisvoice.com/2010/01/citycommissionsinthepeoplesrepublic/ Two http://www.davisvoice.com/2010/02/mobilitycommissionmovesforward/ columns on The Davis Voice in early 2010 first publicized an ongoing discussion about the future of transportation planning in Davis.  The concept being discussed is the creation of a Mobility Commission. This commission would fold together the Bicycle Advisory, Safety & Parking, and Unitrans commissions to emphasize a more holistic planning approach to transportation.  The current City Council has expressed support, but the details of the proposal have yet to be finalized.
