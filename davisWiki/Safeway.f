Safeway is the only Open 24 Hours 24hour supermarkets supermarket in Davis. Sometimes people invent exciting games to play in aisles past 3AM. Some of these games can get you permanently banned from Safeway. But dont worry  they just ban you one location at a time.

The South Davis store is larger than the North Davis store, and has a wider selection of prepared foods (e.g., roast chicken, sandwiches) available 24/7. It also has selfcheckout statons. The North Davis store lacks selfcheckouts, which is especially unfortunate since they are usually severely understaffed. Expect to wait in long lines any time after 5pm, and dont hold your breath if youre waiting at the customer service desk.

Safeways policy is that if you ask how something tastes, they will offer you a sample. This includes fresh cakes which they will cut you a small slice and then throw the whole cake away. While its free food, it shouldnt be abused. If youre not into samples or public appearances, you can also order online and have food Delivery delivered for a small charge.

According to the http://www.usps.com USPS website, both stores sell stamps. Both locations have a Coinstar machine, Redbox DVD, Bluray, and video game rental machine, a Wells Fargo branch and a Starbucks. It is Safeway policy for employees to not accept tips. It is in their contract, and they face termination if they accept tips. Please do not tip the Starbucks baristas in a Safeway or grocery delivery people as it puts them in a difficult situation that could lead to termination.

If you have to get to the stores by public transportation, you can take the 42 Yolobus line, or the G, J, P, or Q Unitrans bus lines to the North Davis Safeway.  For the South Davis location, you can take the W, P, Q, or M Unitrans line.

It is also part of store policy to offer you either a wiki:wikipedia:raincheck or a different brand of the same product to any discounted item. For example: Safeway brand brownie mix is ten for ten dollars, but they happen to be out of the mix. You can either ask the cashier for a raincheck (and wait until another shipment has arrived) or bring a box of Betty Crocker brownie mix of equal weight and ask them to charge you for the price of the Safeway brand.

Safeway has paper and reusable bags for sale at the checkout. Plastic single use bags are banned by city law. Their plastic bags were especially thin, which was problematic if the store clerk didnt double up the bags on heavy items. They have a plastic bag recycling bin at the front of the store. The paper bags are smaller in comparison to those at Save Mart and Nugget and minus the handles. It used to be the case that if you brought your own bags to the checkout (reused paper bags or canvastype bags), they credited your bill at a rate of 3 cents per bag. You got the same discount if you use their bags or those from a competing store.

Safeway has a mediocre selection of decent Beer beers, Wine wines, and Liquor liquors.  Their IPA selection is particularly lacking; most of the time they only have two or three varieties.  They frequently run out of some of the more popular mixers, such as Sweet & Sour or Bonedaddys Margarita Mix.  Keep an eye out for big sales on beer and wine; sometimes youll find $23 off of pretty nice beers, dropping the price below $6 for a 6pack.  If they run out of stock on the shelves, you can have a look in the walkin behind the beer fridge for more.  You can find plenty of cheap beer.

The North Davis Safeway has a photo copy machine which is open 24/7 which is good news if you are desperate!

Sometimes youll find their shopping carts have Wandering Carts wandered away from the store and need help getting back.

Weekly Ads
Safeways http://www.safeway.com/ifl/grocery/WeeklySpecials Weekly Ads are posted online. There are also http://www.safeway.com/IFL/Grocery/Coupons online printable coupons. Here are http://www.bountynsavings.com/category/safeway/ sales and coupon matchup specific to the Davis Safeway from Bounty and Savings.

At the end of October 2010, Safeway implemented a new webbased coupon system.  As an introductory offer, when  you first signed up online, you got a coupon for a free dozen eggs.  With the new system, they have a fairly large selection of coupons, apparently updated weekly, which you can click on to add to your Club Card to be applied automatically while shopping.  They also have personalized prices for things you buy frequently with your club card.  Many products appeared to be around 810% off at first. However, this program is as complicated as it is frustrating. Customers do not want to go to the Safeway website every single week and click on coupons just to get sale prices. If you forget to click on the coupons, you dont get the discounted price. Safeway is just making people go through hoops just to get sale prices and customers end up getting charged more because the system is so complicated to use. Other supermarket chains dont use club cards and give the sales prices to everyone.

Trivia
One of the former employees at the North Davis location is Lamar Heystek, a former ASUCD ASUCD Senate senator and current City Council guy. More than one wiki editor believes that Safeway isnt Safeway without Lamar Heystek Lamar.

The North Davis Safeway was originally built as two stores to circumvent a Davis Ordinance that limited the square footage of Grocery Stores.  The South Side was smaller and housed the deli and liquor departments.  Eventually the ordinance was lifted and the two stores combined.  That is why the doors on the south side are a bit further out, and there is a set of doors permanently closed in the floral department.

Safeway has been in Davis for ages, but the company has an ongoing habit of closing one store and relocating to a different part of town each time a new development/shopping center opens. Former Safeway sites include the area that became State Market State Harvest Market (Harvest) Market (now Cost Plus World Market Cost Plus), the present location of the Davis Food Coop CoOp, and the present location of the Nugget East Davis Nugget, to name a few.

Albertsons Takeover Of Safeway in 2014

Things were going very badly financially for Safeway over the past several years. In February of 2014, Safeway announced that it was actively looking to be sold to another company. Credit Suisse speculated that an outright sale to Cerberus or Kroger would be in the best interests of shareholders. Cerberus is the owner of Albertsons. It was 2006, when Albertsons was the company that was failing and ended up being bought by the acquisition hungry private equity firm Cerberus. Like a vulture it swooped in and bought what was left of Albertsons and proceeded to close stores and run their Albertsons stores into the ground. However, under the control of Cerberus, the new Albertsons chain slowly went back to its old ways and became more and more aggressive. Albertsons recently bought the following supermarket chains: JewelOsco (biggest chain in the Chicago area), Acme(MidAtlantic), Shaws and Star Markets(New England states), and United Markets of Texas. Albertsons is on a vengeful conquest to become the largest supermarket chain in the nation and control the supermarket business across the entire country. The locally owned Safeway chain will cease to exist, and power would move to the corporate office of Albertsons in Idaho.

The owner of Albertsons announced on March 6, 2014 that it was taking over Safeway, although Albertsons CEO presently states they will keep  existing retail footprint of both companies intact http://www.progressivegrocer.com/topstories/headlines/nationalsupermarketchains/id41158/safewayalbertsonstomerge/ (source).  With one powerful swoop, Albertsons will dominate the supermarket business practically from coast to coast creating an evil empire of high priced supermarkets.  Of course, that  empire is only a tiny sliver of the megalithic Cerberus Capital Management that is the owner.

When Albertsons bought Lucky in 1998, Albertsons also said they would keep the Lucky brand. They changed their mind and rebranded all Lucky stores as Albertsons one year later in 1999 including the Davis Lucky store. The CEO of Albertsons back then was no stranger to making promises he could not keep. Lucky was the low price leader and Albertsons promised increased savings to customers and lower prices once the takeover was complete. The opposite happened. When Lucky became Albertsons, prices went through the roof and many loyal Lucky customers switched to Safeway which was less expensive than Albertsons. If you believe that the merger of Albertsons and Safeway will bring lower prices, you have not been paying attention to the history of the lies of Albertsons. Albertsons killed the Lucky brand and brought high prices. Now Albertsons is taking over Safeway. History is repeating itself, and the public is being taken for a ride again.

20050629 22:46:11 nbsp South Daviss Safeway is MUCH better, and the workers are much nicer. Users/AnnieSirrah

  Not really... the thing about certain Safeway workers is that theyre terribly insincere. Who could blame them though? Its not that some of us arent honest workers, its just that we arent compensated enough, not even decently.  Users/HD

20050629 22:47:45 nbsp Actually I find the workers at North Safeway are pretty damn cool.  Maybe cause I see them so often, but even at 2 or 4 or 6 in the morning they are pretty chill.  But South Davis is newer and nicer, agreed. And they have a lot more of the salads near the deli, the North Davis one always runs out.  Users/EdWins ES

The lines are always incredibly long as every undergrad in town is stocking up on Doritos and booze.  Users/JanelleAlvstadMattson

20051112 01:04:39 nbsp The workers always seem miserable, especially poor overworked Lamar. This particular chain stopped carrying a rare item that I couldnt find anywhere else, and the baggers were always a bit ditzy. Going in after 11 at night always ensured us a thorough display of the stock clerks clowning around loudly to the local rap and hiphop station, usually attempting to catch some poor females eye. At least the store was orderly. Users/TarynHornen

20051216 04:41:56 nbsp Who cares?  The South Davis location is convenient, fairly priced, and has a reasonable selection.  That matters more than whether or not the employees have a good bedside manner during the 60 seconds you actually converse with them.

20051216 22:44:43 nbsp Its not the 60 seconds Im in contact with them that bothers me, its the fact that I dont like shopping at a place where the employees are disgruntled.  If theyre not being treated fairly by the management, why should I support the store? Users/DudeNude

20051217 15:19:17 nbsp Get off your high Coop horse. If you truly didnt want to shop where employees arent treated fairly, you wouldnt shop at any retail location anywhere. Is it fair for Nordstrom to charge $200 for a pair of jeans and pay their workers $8.50 an hour? Or OfficeMax to sell thousands upon thousands daily while paying their employees as little as minimum wage in some markets? Or Staples, a Fortune 500 company whose starting salary is right above $7.15/hour in most markets? Retail is not fair, thats a fact. Safeway employees bring in a fortune compared to most retail stores (because of the union).  Users/DomenicSantangelo

  Granted if the Safeway employers all worked a guaranteed 40 hours a week, youd be right about bringing in a fortune. Thats also considering youve worked for Safeway for eternities.  Users/HD

20060804 11:01:46 nbsp The remodeling is somewhat inconvenient, but on the other hand, they are remodeling it so it looks more like the South Davis Safeway. Which seems to be a main gripe here. However, I do hate it whenever any store shuffles around their merchandise.   Users/MatthewTom

20060830 19:24:12 nbsp I suppose that, due to my stillnewbieness in Davis (entering sophomore year at this time of writing,) the North Davis Safeway is more or less a Godsend.  I lived in Castilian South and Ill be moving into Alverado for sophomore year, and close proximity of the place, along with the 24hour openness, means that its really, really convenient to go for 2AM food runs.  Not to mention theres no cars anywhere in the parking lot and the store is so quiet its almost...surreal. Users/AlexanderHo

20070812 21:08:37 nbsp while i do like safeway much better than albertsons, does anyone find it odd that the express lines are 20 items or less (shouldnt they have like at least one 10 item or less isle).  Secondly the signs are like 10 feet in the air, hanging from the ceiling (ive seen many of short people in the express line mistakenly, me included). Usualy the signs at other grocery stores are just above eye level.  In fact it would be impossible to see the sign at safeway if you were actually in the line since the sign would be right above you.  Just thought that this design was a little odd. Users/MattHh

20070828 21:51:29 nbsp Does it count as greeting the customer if you look up for half a second without making eye contact?  The store is fine, but it has the overlong line problem that probably every supermarket has (though at least Savemart has a self checkout). Users/MisterProfessor

20070909 23:26:23 nbsp The South Davis Safeway is reasonably clean.  The employees are reasonably nice and the prices are decent.

20071028 22:59:05 nbsp I do not recommend shopping here at all unless you are looking for something unique to safeway. The problem is that it is much more expensive than Winco or Grocery outlet, and you can spend a fortune here just getting a few items. They have a good selection of flowers, but flowers are usually cheaper at SaveMart (but not quite as nice). For food, make sure to get your moneys worth and go to Woodland for Grocery Outlet.  Users/AnnaF

20080201 15:11:09 nbsp i hate the north davis safeway. for some reason they are almost always out of tofu or dont stock it even though they have a huge section for it. its one of the main reasons i go out for groceries so its pretty aggravating for them to nearly consistently not have it when i go. Users/MiranPark

20080201 16:17:30 nbsp I completely agree with you about the North Safeway. Never go past 5 pm, because they are out of all their ad items and when you ask an associate if they have any more, they simply reply, sorry, were out. Who runs out of their ad items in the middle of the week? Do they not know how to order? I worked in grocery for 5 years, and we would have been fired had we treated customers this way. The unfortunate thing about big chain stores. Users/BrandonBarrette

  Safeway management terrible. Tell all your friends. Its the reason why Safeway doesnt cater to customers, even when the 60 year old lady comes in complaining about how the paper bags dont have handles, and the Nugget does. Its all about saving money for the company and not for bringing in business.  Users/HD
  Actually, Safeway gets new shipments of items every day, in the wee hours of the morning. Thus, if an item is out, there is almost no chance of it being in back. The back part of a standard Safeway is very small, and usually only contains a few things like cereals or soda, so an employee can usually tell immediately if what a customer is asking for has any chance of being in back. Also, your average courtesy clerk has absolutely no say in what gets put into the ads, or what gets restocked each morning.  Users/JoePomidor

20080218 18:05:27 nbsp The North Davis Safeway is the devil.  Whenever there are liquor sales advertised in their circular, by the time you go to the store they are ALWAYS either sold out or maybe have only one bottle left  even if its the first day of the sale.

Also, when I asked for a Safeway card they actually wanted me to stand there in line filling out the lengthy application, despite the fact that there were 3 or 4 people behind me in line.  At the old Albertsons they gave away discount cards like candy and would never inconvenience their customers like that.  Save yourself a hassle and go to SaveMart or the Coop. Users/AlexPerkins

  Or you couldve chosen to fill the card at home and bring it back at your next check out. You couldve even filled it out after the checkout, and just handed it back to the checker and you wouldve been fine.  Users/HD

20080322 13:46:29 nbsp I LOVE this Safeway. Yes, there are days when it seems like theyve been picked clean, often making me feel like a catastrophy is immenint and Im the only one that didnt know about it. However, the staff is always helpful and pleasant. The guy and gal that run the sushi station are always willing to make a sushi tray to order. I think the best feature about this Safeway, is the starbucks. I love that no one corrects me when I order a LARGE drink. Every other starbucks makes me feel like an idiot when I dont use the appropriate lingo.  Users/MamaLoebs

20080328 15:36:17 nbsp I just discovered Safeways Signature Chicken Salad.  You can find it in the deli and it is delicious!  Its a perfect chicken salad and they dont drench it in too much sauce.  Its the right amount.  I just bought a pound of the stuff today.  Its cheap and good. Users/CurlyGirl26

20080402 11:01:36 nbsp I had the unfortunate experience of shopping at the north Safeway just last week.  I am personally partial to the Nugget, since I worked there for several years before I got my “big kid” job, but I was open minded and had a few gift cards I had won in a raffle to burn.  The store was clean and I actually ran into a few people I knew, since I don’t live in Davis, I was surprised.  I found everything I needed and my trip was going well.  Since this was my last stop after many errands, my 1 year old son was becoming less and less cooperative the more I wandered down the aisles, so I broke down and gave him an Easter balloon, which I intended to buy.  By the time I got the counter for check out and after placing all my groceries on the belt (which is a huge pet peeve of mine!) I proceeded to watch the woman scan my groceries.  She asked if I had “paid for the balloon in floral?” I said no (didn’t know that was an option), she said, “OK then I need to scan it”.  Now picture me, a Mom, trying to pry a balloon ribbon out of the hands of a 1 year old in need of a nap was not going to have the outcome anyone wanted to witness or be a part of.  So, I told her, “it says $3.99 right here, can you just punch it in manually?” she responded with, no I really need to scan it.  I said oh ok and attempted, once again, to pry the ribbon from my son’s hands, at the moment I realized the bar scan was on a sticker that was removable from the ribbon, I said “I got it, here it is”, instead of taking the sticker, she walked away to get “another” balloon to scan.  When she returned she scanned the new balloon and I looked and her and said, you apparently do not have children, paid and left.  I will not shop at that Davis Safeway again; I don’t care if they are giving away free stuff. Users/mzscott911

  How unfortunate for you. The checker couldve just input the price manually and use the Managers override and you wouldnt have had to go through the epic ordeal of fighting your son for the balloon.  Users/HD

20080416 22:49:37 nbsp Christ, the Safeway in North Davis is the worst Safeway in America.  Every time I go there, theyre always out of what I want plus they dont have as much selection.  Even though this Safeway is more convenient (for me), I think Im going to trek across town and do my shopping at the South location.
 Users/CurlyGirl26

20080609 19:48:38 nbsp I like to get the chinese food, but they put way to much rice and not enough meat. And the sandwiches are good, but only a couple people who work in the deli actually know how to make a sandwich. Users/Adaleen

20080612 16:19:39 nbsp OK, I have to share this story.  I went here with my girlfriend to do some shopping. We loaded up on a bunch of food to last us a while. She was still unloading the basket when I looked at our total. It was around 300 something. I figured that it  would go down when we ran our Safeway card. It did, but only by about 10 bucks. Our total was around 360. I then asked the cashier if that was right. His response was. yeah, foods expensive these days(Im paraphrasing). In utter shock, we walked out of the store but stopped to have a look at the receipt. Lo and behold, we were charged 187 dollars for a stinkin bell pepper!! And we didnt even buy any bell peppers!!! We got our money back, but the moral of the story is, dont take the cashiers word for it. Users/GabeDavis

20080630 18:33:20 nbsp For those who do not want to have their real name spoken by the cashier when using a club card, you can try the phone number (408)5550153. It is a card made with the address of the Paper Street Soap Company from Fight Club with the name of Tyler Durden. Users/Jedron

20080630 18:47:51 nbsp Safeway employees are constantly told to be nice to customers, for fear of the dreaded Secret Shopper. I worked as a Courtesy Clerk at a Safeway in my hometown, and I still shudder at the memory of it. Suffice to say, decency is a two way street, and many customers seem to forget that. Users/JoePomidor

I think that the above comment is probably one of the most considerate things Ive ever heard in regards to Courtesy Clerks who work at Safeway. Too often comes the day that the angry customer whos had a bad day takes out their anger on the innocent employee whos doing absolutely nothing wrong. I think its also offensive when customers come in and demand respect when they dont give any to begin with or are condescending simply because they think people who work at a grocery store are beneath them. Honestly, people just need to get over it. What it comes down to is something everyone should learn at a very young age, treat others with the same kind of respect that you want to be treated with. Users/JonathanMartinez


20080812 16:57:05 nbsp The lines in the north Davis Safeway are horrible no matter the time of day. They need to get more cashiers on shift so people can get through a line in under 10 minutes.

20081216 23:41:37 nbsp Me and my friend went into North Safeway to buy a duraflame log around 9pm on a Sunday, the line was about 20 people long and only one checker was their. As we walked in, the checker just stared at us as we walked in, and than called her manager to the front over the P.A. and as we looked at the logs, a man who worked their (manager maybe) asked us if we could use any help. He looked very annoyed with us for whatever reason and I have NEVER been asked if I needed help in any supermarket anywhere, so we told him we had what we needed. As we walked away, he walked over to the logs and gave it a once over than opened a new lane just as we got to the front. He told us he could help us than told the 15 other people who jumped behind us that he was only helping us as we had an issue.

20090108 18:19:32 nbsp I bought a loaf of bread here the 3rd that was dated the 7th, ate two slices, and ended up with food poisoning the next day. I look at the loaf later only to see the entire bottom half was moldy. Really gross. It was obvious but only on the bottom side so I couldnt notice at the time of purchase. When I went back I saw many remnants of those little date stickers, so I really hope they dont switch those out. I will definitely be more careful to thoroughly examine the food I buy.

You get out of it what you put into it so if you worked there and were lazy or you just think you know what it is like to work there guess again (that was in 2004 so maybe its not like that anymore). Ill admit that all the employees arent always very friendly. As far as prices go, yes its cheaper to go to Woodland and shop at Food4Less. You can get a pallet of cheezits for like 2.99 but for the students whose mommies and daddies didnt buy them a car, for the students who walk or ride bikes and need an accessible supermarket 24 HOURS A DAY Safeway is extremely convenient and not horribly expensive. If you know how to shop and use the ad you can leave with a lot of food and not spend a lot of money. They have great deals every week including BOGOs. The lines are long, its a very busy store. If you go in at night and wait in huge lines, Im sorry it does suck but thats the manager NOT scheduling nearly enough people as we need to get those people out the door and everyone takes it out on the checkers. So for those who are in line yelling at the checkers or dropping your groceries and leaving all pissed off, take a minute to call in to the manager or write out a comment card because if enough people did, maybe something would change. Believe me, all the checkers have tried to tell them. Anyway Im done ranting.  I get annoyed when things are out of stock constantly too they need to work on that, but if they dont carry something you want, they will order it for you, just ask. Users/dvntboy

  About the first part about it sucking to work at...I got a job at Safeway a couple years ago and the wages they were offering and the scheduled raises wouldnt have put me anywhere near $20 after 2 years.  I think after 2 years it would have been closer to about $10.  I was thinking what the hell, I thought Safeway employees got paid well?.  Apparently that is no longer true due to a new union contract.  It may have changed since then.  The point is, there might be employees there that are only making a few cents over minimum wage.  That might help disgruntle them.  I cant comment about actual working conditions, though.  I got offered a better job before my orientation thing, so I never ended up working there.   Also, to everyone who complains about sale items not being available...thats pretty much true about every store.  When things go on sale a lot of people tend to come in and buy them.  Sometimes the whole point of a sale is to get rid of the items.  Users/BradBenedict

20090202 19:37:45 nbsp Be careful locking your bicycle near the South Davis Safeway and also watch where you park. The employees that smoke like to hang out near the bikes and the parking lot and smoke up the area with their nicotine. Disgusting. I have resolved to park my bike at the Rite Aid now. As far as parking my vehicle, I dont know. Just this evening I was parked in the Officemax parking lot next door and sure enough there was a Safeway employee with friend, seated on the curb right in front of my truck. I had to walk through their cloud of cigarette smoke to load the groceries. Safeway is totally ghetto!! Users/G.L.

20090216 16:06:42 nbsp Whys there so much hate on the Safeway in North Davis? I buy my bread, rice, eggs, dairy, juice, meat, and produce there. I dont bother with the convenience foods (deli & frozen section), because I cook everything myself from scratch (save for baking bread and rolling my own pasta).

Never had a problem with spoilage; my bread always outlasts my housemates, who get theirs from the coop. Never had a problem with sale items being sold out; I usually go after class, which is on most days 1pm3pm, but even when I make the inevitable night run, I always find what I need. Rarely wait for more than three minutes in line; more often than not I get a tap on the shoulder I can help you over here. Admittedly Ive never been to the South Davis branch, but I fail to see whats going on up here that warrants the complaints here. Users/HJH

20090302 13:58:03 nbsp I know what is wrong. Kids living on their parents dime thinking everyone should wait on the hand and foot. Read enough of the comments and that is clear. What business doesnt have employees that go out and smoke, its not illegal, but it is to do it inside. I dont smoke, but let them if they choose.

As I post this, Ive been in line for the single open checkout line for over 10 minutes with a dozen people ahead of me and more behind.  No one has opened a second register.

20090324 15:15:06 nbsp I work at the north davis/covell location, Im the pale gangly white guy with the just got shocked hair that works graves.  The reason were out of sale items at the beginning of the week is actually due to the time of day shopping is done, not the day of the week.  We get full trucks worth of groceries in every single night, you guys do a good job of gutting us every day, but we thank you for it, sales  payroll  good.

General grocery stocking happens between the hours of 11pm and 7:30am, davis is full of college peoples looking for good food deals, you do the math.  Unfortunately, Safeway has a self auditing system that involves shops in which they rate their clerks and overall shopping experience, those can only happen between the hours of 8am and 89pm?, hence, in the proper evening, there is like no one checking and the lines suck super bad because payroll has sucked up staffing those earlier hours.  :/

We night shift have to split our time between ringing up the party people and putting stuff on the shelf for the next day, unfortunately some clerks get cranky and sometimes the party people miss out on a pleasant shopping experience.  :(  Typically we have 3 people to run the registers, do an inventory of the store, order 5001000 pieces (cases of items) and throw the pieces ordered from the night before, then face the store up to make it look pretty.  Its a crunch every single night.  We do our best though.

I honestly get a kick reading the trash talk on the wiki, so Ill probably go back to lurking away after this.

To the star with the paparazzi following her around, you were the most positive customer of the evening and made my night last shift, even if you had to visit us twice.  Thank you for that!

20090424 15:27:00 nbsp Comment on the Sushi available here:  I think its a good deal for the price/quality ratio.  If you get there during the hours when it is staffed, I know the people who work there are more than willing to custom make your sushi with whatever ingredients you want.  The lady who is there around 430 on weekdays does an especially good job, making me some cream cheese/shrimp/avocado rolls fresh when I asked (and thats not one of the menu options).

You can get I think 12 pieces for about 6 dollars.  Its not as fancy as Zen Toro or Sushi Unlimited, but everytime Ive gotten it made its tasted fresh  definately fresher that Mermaid Sushi at the Coop in my opinion, and usually other places are a bit more picky about letting you customize your rolls (That Ive seen at least).  I cant vouch for the sushi sitting in the isle, as the freshness would depend on how long its been there (I think its fresh made daily though, and everytime Ive picked it up around 46pm its been tasty and fresh). Users/C.T.
  A note on the Sushi:  Alex and/or Christina make the Sushi fresh throughout the day.  It sells rather well and nothing really ends up sitting out for too long.  The stuff you find out after hours is made last thing before they take off for the night.Users/robnightcrew

20090509 01:01:04 nbsp um, i have to confess my love for the <i>south</i> davis safeway. even though its farther from me, they carry soy ice cream (purely decadent) which means that crazy vegans with crazy soy ice cream cravings at crazy hours of the night can have their dreams answered even when the coop is closed. sure its a tad more expensive. but i get to eat cookie avalanche soy ice cream at 3 in the morning. thank you south davis safeway. i love you.

20090518 10:36:37 nbsp Ok you bitchy, gripey people. I have to admit, when I first moved off campus to S Davis I was not happy with the customer service at the S Davis Safeway. They do not kiss ass like in N Davis. However, there are DEF cuter guys workin in S Davis, and they are funny as hell, and love to flirt! You wanna p/u a cute guy? Yeah, hit up S Davis Safeway! Talk about customer service! LOL! You should see their service AFTER work hours! :) But seriously, once you are a reg customer, they take real good care of you, they just take a little more warmin up. The meat and fish departments are a huge disapointment though. Nothing local or organic. Coop and Nugget much better for that. However, S Davis meat dept guys rock! They will do just abt anything you ask short of ropin and killin the cow you want! :) I dont eat the sushi there though, but who the hell eats Safeway sushi anyway? Hit Moshi Moshi across the street, or Zen Toro, or if you like Korean style, nothing beats Kims downtown. You can get 21 pieces for $4, and she makes it fresh everyday. Granted, nothing raw and exotic, but cheap, tasty and healthy! Back on subject... Safeway employees do get paid well, and they stay a long time, so it cant be too bad. They are just very short staffed and busy, but they work hard and do their best. But dealing with drunk college students and crying 3 year olds day in and day out isnt gonna make anyone overly pleasant. But be sweet to em and theyll take good care of you! ;) Users/sthdvsgrl
  The idea that Safeway employees (at least those who have been there less than 7 years) make decent money is a myth.  Ive been on the Night Crew at North Davis almost 3 years now, I make $10.40 an hour and stay up all night, every night.  For the record, Im nice to people because I genuinely like to make them happy, not because Im trying to kiss ass at ridiculous in the morning.

20090526 21:13:57 nbsp Yesterday My girlfriend and I bought a bread (7 grains french bread)at South Safeway with the due date of May 28th. At home we opened to eat and we found that there was white mold on the surface(we couldnt see it before because the mold was on under the first slice of bread). The mold was not only on a slice but rest of the whole bread. We were upset and disguisted about it so we brought it to the customer service. The employee there just gave our money($3) back and didnt say sorry or anything. She was like, here you go. and gave us the money back. That was it. Dont buy bread at South Safeway. You might find yourself eating moldy bread. YUCK!!!!!!!!! Users/kjhjzang

20090527 00:09:35 nbsp I have to say I have never seen white mold on bread at Safeway. I have bought their uncut french bread, and it did have a coating of white flour on the bottom of the bread. I think it is used to keep the bread from sticking to the oven. Safeway french bread is baked daily. Safeway guarantees their french bread to be fresh at 5PM or it is free. I doubt mold can grow in that short of a time period. However, at another Safeway that was not located in Davis, I bought freshly baked wheat bread which grew a little green mold after several days of sitting unrefrigerated (around 3 or 4 days at least). I believe it had to do with the freshly baked bread not having preservatives and the fact that the bread came in plastic bags which trapped moisture. You should freeze the bread that you cannot eat in one day. Dont leave bread sitting around for more than a day. I trust the french bread to be fresh, but not the Safeway precut sliced loaves of Whole Wheat bread baked in the store that is packaged in plastic bags. Users/MaxLucas

20090608 00:43:25 nbsp I dont usually have strong reactions to what I see on the shelves at supermarkets, but what I saw tonight at Safeway really upset me.  The boxes of cereal are now about 1/4 to 1/6 the size that they used to be.  Its not the hidden (massive) price increase that bothers me so much as the fact that Safeway is now selling cereal in boxes that hold only enough cereal for 23 breakfasts, thus greatly increasing the amount of packaging that must be used, the number of trees that must be cut down, and the amount of trash that will wind up in landfills.  What a horrible waste of resources!  I used to buy one box and it would last me two weeks.  Now one box might last me for 2 or 3 days.  If I continue to buy just one box, I have to make twice the number of trips to the store, wasting energy.  If I buy more than one box, I create much more paper waste.  I think that shopping at costco instead of safeway may be in order now  at least they carry reasonable sizes of food...

I dont know if this is actually Safeways fault, or a change in product packaging for cereal makers to hide the massive increases in their products over the past few years.  But I would encourage shoppers to consider buying their cereal at stores that respect their shoppers and the environment by carrying products in reasonable sizes and packaging. Users/IDoNotExist
   Ive noticed this in a lot of the big grocery stores over the last several years. (Safeway, Albertons, Ralphs, etc).  Seems like the 12.5oz box or whatever it is (10.5 for the healthy cereals with berries ^_^) is becoming the main size.  I think it generally was 14 or 15 or 16.5oz prior depending on the manufacturer typically, with the family size ones generally being 20oz+?  I might very well be off on my sizes, Im rather sleepy.  I almost always buy my cereal at Target  its far cheaper, and typically the larger boxes.  More selection than Costco...   Also IDNE, http://www.yumsugar.com/2753959 this is a bad link but Kellog is testing out  a spacesaving box that is expected to fit into pantries more easily. The ecofriendly design holds the same amount of cereal but uses less materials.  Hopefully similar things are at play? users/edwins ES

20090617 12:17:05 nbsp Dear Safeway Grocery Baggers and Cashiers:

Please stop smashing my fruits and vegetables!!!  If you want to smash produce and put it back on the shelf that is one thing, but once I have paid for the things in my shopping cart, they belong to me and as my property they should be treated as such.  If YOU had paid $5 for a bag of apples, or $4 for a bunch of bananas I know for a fact you wouldnt be smashing them.

Here are a few simple guidelines for bagging groceries, since it is apparent that Safeway refuses to train you properly.  If you cannot understand how to follow these rules, then please just get out of my way and let me bag my own groceries thanks:

1.  SOFT THINGS GO WITH OTHER SOFT THINGS.  Hard things with hard things, and heavy things with, thats right you guessed it, OTHER HEAVY THINGS.  Some heavy things just go it alone, because they are either too big for a bag, or too heavy, or would be a waste to bag at all.

2. If I have 3 canvas bags this does not mean all of my groceries should fit into them.  Sometimes I buy more, sometimes less, if I have more I would like some plastic bags.  If I have less you shouldnt put all of my groceries into one bag (see rule 1).

3. If I have a large canvas bag this doesnt mean you can load 20 lbs worth of groceries into ONE BAG.  I have to carry this from my car to my house and would prefer to have an even distribution of weight per bag.  To be honest you have no clue how people carry things home so you better pack in the most evenly distributed manner possible.

4. Layering is very important, as things come down the line put the heavier and more sturdy items in first and then lighter and more easily broken, bruised and squished items on top or last.  Watch out for sharp poking objects.  A bag of chips ARE NOT a cushion for 6 cans of soup!!!

Seriously folks, if you cannot bag groceries how can you expect to move up in the grocery business?  Let alone the world?  How would you like it if I came over to your house and sat on your cereal, stomped on your greens, practiced juggling with your pears, used your bananas for a hand cushion and threw tomato cans at your mushrooms?  Seriously.  I will do it and you dont have to pay me a cent.

Let me reiterate for the last time, if you cant bag groceries, dont even try.  I prefer to do it myself because I am a control freak and if I am paying $75 for basic necessities I want them to actually be EDIBLE when I get home.  I would also appreciate it if you did not act like your soul has been crushed when I say I would like to bag my own groceries. No offense, I dont trust my juicy perishables with just anyone.

Sincerely,
Users/CarrieBishop


  Seriously bag your own groceries then!! I shop their every week and they never do that to my produce... quit complaining
  I think there are probably a lot of people who dont appreciate the subleties of grocery bagging, and I agree with Carrie, this is absolutely their job. A lot of people complain on this site because they were being jerks and got treated like a jerk, but I think this is a legitimate point regardless of what happened in Carries particular situation. The advice is relevant to all grocery stores, employees, and customers.  Users/NickSchmalenberger
  I agree with the general point; but personally I care more about the checkers/cashiers.   If they pack it poorly, I tend to readjust it right when Im walking away and usually theres no harm at all.  Most of the time, they get it right.  But the cashiers/checkers, ugh.  I get that youre trying to do your job.  I get that there might be people in line behind me and youve been working a long shift and youre tired.  Go ahead, slide those cans and jars, I know theyll be fine.  But dont slide them into the cushion of my bag of chips. That doesnt happen often, but what happens way too much is them practically tossing or bowling my fruit down to the bagging area.  Dont toss my bananas, and dont roll my apples and oranges or what have you.  I hate mushy fruit, and that it really drives me nuts that in trying to be an efficient cashier and speed me through my checkout, you do far more damage than the rare (for me, apparantly not so rare for Carrie) poor bagging job. Most bigger grocery stores tend to have this problem, but it used to be a frequent thing for me at the Davis Safeways.   users/edwins ES
   I dont have this problem 100% of the time I go, some baggers are better than others.  But for whatever reason it is always the single point of extreme annoyance for me about grocery shopping to get home and see juice oozing from my fruit or my lettuce reduced to a green slimey mess.  I could care less about waiting in line, people clogging aisles, etc.  But when I get to watch someone manhandle my bananas I cringe.  I have been doing my own grocery shopping since I was 18 and not until I moved to Davis did this even become a big deal to me.  Is it a lack of training or a lack of interest in customer satisfaction?  Hard to say.  But I once again say they are my groceries once I pay for them, as such they shouldnt be thoughtlessly abused.  Please see a copy of my above letter also posted in Nugget Market, its not just a Safeway problem in my book.  Users/CarrieBishop

20090621 02:18:32 nbsp Went in the N. Davis location this afternoon and got busted by the head clerk and her regional manager for using internet coupons. Apparently even the management are not following their own http://www.safeway.com/IFL/Grocery/CouponsPolicy Safeway Coupon Policy. She told me theyre not taking internet IP coupons because they could be copied, and told me rudely not to come in here gain, since theyll not be taking those coupons. I am using legitimate manufacturers coupons printed from safeway.com, for Gods sake (only 2 coupons are allowed per computer)! I said Im calling corporate and she told me this is their corporate policy. Hello? Read your own company website! I was more amused by the ignorance of the head clerk and some regional manger she talked to on the phone to confirm this policy. Im bringing my business elsewhere. I have a feeling that Davis is such an affluent community that they dont see many couponers :( I got trouble at Rite Aid for using coupons too. Its stupid of them to treat coupon users like criminals since its the manufacturer that are going to pay them!!    Users/val


20090621 02:18:32 nbsp I bought Eating Right™ Eggs from the Cowell location. Their eggs have the Safeway S stamped on every egg. Personally, its disgusting to me. How can I be certain when I crack the eggshell that no shards would land on the yolk. And is their stamp edible? I would never know. Why did they need to stamp S on every egg in the first place. Advertisement?  Users/WengFF

  Do you mean to say that there is a stamp on the eggshell or the egg yolk/white itself?  If there is a stamp on the egg, then unless you are cracking the egg improperly, there should be no eggshell shards that would land in the yolk.  Also, if my assumption is correct, then Im wondering why you would be eating the eggshell at all.  If I am wrong and there is a stamp on the eggyolk/white (which doesnt seem physically possible), then I have no idea.  But considering most people dont eat eggshells (which are nearly all washed properly prior to shipment), I dont think stamping the shell has any effect on the egg.  Users/SunjeetBaadkar
  In some states, they have the date and origin farm stamped on them.   Its pretty nice.  Im not sure why youd complain about that or the fact that they print on the egg carton too... you dont eat either the carton or the shell, and the stuff you actually eat or use isnt printed on. jw
  Security.  Cashiers are supposed to pop open any carton of eggs you buy, the obvious reason being to make sure none of the eggs are visibly broken.  The other big reason is to verify the purchase, the right number and type of eggs (ie, if they pop it open and see six white eggs and six brown ones, something is wrong).  I dont know what Eating Right eggs are specifically or if theyre costlier, but I bet you one purpose of the stamp is to distinguish them from other normal eggs, making sure theyre packed in the right carton and not switched into others.  If youre concerned about the stamp itself, a dab of alcohol or vinegar and wiping with a napkin should take care of it.  Its a bit of an annoyance, but its pretty harmless. users/edwins ES

20090817 13:31:32 nbsp I haaaate buying sushi from the North Davis Safeway. I would stand in front of the sushi selection trying to decide which kind I like (unakyu or california, brown rice or white rice) and the chefs keep saying its fresh. i just made it. theyre all the same. I tell them that Im just deciding what kind to get. Then they repeat its fresh. i just made it. theyre all the same as if I was being picky or something. This happens EVERY SINGLE TIME and annoys me so much that I dont bother buying their sushi anymore. They should just let their customers decide in peace. Its not like im lifting all of them and criticizing their quality. Users/julpham

20090830 14:22:56 nbsp Some comments about North Davis:

1. I needed help reaching something on a high shelf and it took me a very long time to get someone to help me.  Theyre clearly understaffed.
2. Believe me, Ive worked retail, and I know customers can be horrifically rude sometimes.  But thats no excuse to ignore the customer youre currently helping to vent with coworkers about a customer that came in five minutes ago.  Its extremely inappropriate, and made service even slower than it already is.  I dont go to Safeway to hear 4 middleaged women gossip.


3. A word to customers:  STOP parking your carts in the middle of parking spaces! How would you like it if a cart rolled into the side of your car and made a nice scratch or dent? How much does it take to just WALK ten feet and drop your cart off where youre supposed to.  Dont you think the poor kid who has to wear black pants and a heavy button up to collect carts for hours in 105 degree weather already has a hard enough time?  Not to mention the fact that the parking lot is already hard enough to park in, wasting a space for a plastic cart is just ridiculous.
 Users/JesBisagno

20091124 20:33:41 nbsp Definitely understaffed.  The lines at the Safeway next to highway 113 are horrendous!  Furthermore, their produce section isnt even funny to look at, 99% of the time they are out of stock on half of their produce and about 50% of the time I go here, the produce I get turns out being old or partially moldy (grapes, strawberries, potatoes, cherries).

FACT: Davis tries to be a small town, but the problem is: there are too many people.  Davis is not a small town, it has a lot of people and all the city council does is enforce strict parking and driving laws that keep Davis congested with angry city dwellers who dont look out for each other, but instead look for how to get in front of each other, where it is in line or on the road.

20091219 13:40:03 nbsp Gosh, this is all starting to look like a complaints forum! If you want to whine and complain so much, hit up /b/. Honestly.
Ive been going to the S. Davis Safeway since it first opened, literally. Its near my house and on my route to both school and work, and thanks to my hours (and sleeping habits) I tend to make thorough use of theirs. My early morning shopping adventures have always been met with good service and a generally friendly attitude for the 10 years or so that Ive been around the place. If Im in around 6AM on the way to work I tend to get a chuckle out of the usual cashiers since they know me as a regular... always bananas and milk for the hotel I work at under my mothers management. Just this morning, Doing your moms shopping again? Hows business?

To the payment vs. service issue, it is of my opinion that the customers are just as much responsible for the service they recieve as the employees. I make a point of being polite and personable, even for such a short time, expecting and almost always recieving the same in return. I expect to get what I pay for, as well... cheap products are cheap. I know about what I should get for my money so youll never see me complain bitterly about a $3 sandwich that turns out to be worse than one from Subway... though Ive honestly never had that happen. :) Safeway is the reason why Ive not been inside a McDonalds in over 5 years... cheaper food that is real food. Whaddya know.

ANYWAY. </rant>

Ive discovered the wonders of hot, fresh cheese bagels at 3AM and curses on my lactose intolerance, Im darned well going to get them!
As far as living on a student budget, the store has been a godsend. I work all weekend long but if I grab a couple fresh baguettes, cheese, and whatever else I feel like having with it I can nosh on those for three days when Im too tired to do anything else. $15 or so for 3 days worth of food (for a big eater at that). Not too shabby. Ive been known to obscenely dangle my baguette of the day in the face of some poor victim just to feel proud of my victory over their Wonderbread. Take that, bland, prepackaged fiend.

20100117 17:59:23 nbsp I tend to have bad experiences at the N. Safeway so I prefer the s. safeway.  Today was another bad experience at n. safeway, I got home and notice on my receipt that I was charged for safeway water that I didnt buy:( and it just wasnt worth the time or gas to drive all the way back to ask for the money.  Oh, and this isnt the first time I was charged for an extra item, which gets annoying b/c it adds up $$$.  Other times its short handed staff or bad customer service.  Anyone ever noticed the short haired brunett chick who wears the high collar dress shirt (I think shes assistant/manager?) shes kinda snoutty, I notice that everytime Ive been in the checkout line with her (trust me I try to avoid her)she doesnt acknowledge me which makes me wounder if she does it to students and people of color.  It happens everytime Im at the checkout line with her, where she would greet the ppl in front of me and thank them, but doesnt acknowledge me not even after I pay she doesnt even say thank you (not that I expect her to, but its just good customer service)and it happens everytime, which makes me think shes snobbish and provide selective customer service.  @ 1st I thought maybe Im just takin it out of porportion, but no!  Ive actually said hi to her once at the checkout stand and before she replied, swear to god, she looked me up and down then said hi. This is just one example of the ample times of poor customer service.

Ive been shopping more and more @ the nugget who has superior customer service and honestly the price is comparable.  Ive been trying not to shop @ safeway b/c I just dont want to support a place of business that treats that customer so poorly. Users/kikao

20100118 23:21:25 nbsp I lived just a couple of apartments away from the north Safeway for more than 4 years and did nearly all of my shopping there.  During peak times, the lines can get pretty long (and late night, which is grossly understaffed)

Ive since moved a little farther away, and now that I typically drive to the store rather than walking, I find that its usually a lot easier to cruise the extra couple of miles to Nuggetespecially at peak times.  I do most of my shopping there now, only using Safeway when I just need one or two things and want to make the trip very quick.

That said, I still dont mind Safeway.  I think that if the parking lot at the Marketplace didnt suck so terribly, Id be far more likely to go there more.  That place hurts my brain... as do a great many of the people walking and driving in it. Users/TomGarberson

20100525 11:05:33 nbsp The Davis management runs their crews ragged and shows them no respect. I met a nice girl who is working in the bakery of north Davis store. She was helpful to me, but a supervisor reprimanded her while she was assisting me. She had to excuse herself and when she came back she looked like she had been crying. She continued to cheerfully help me but I had a rotten feeling for the rest of my time inside that store. Is this a usual practice for bosses to pick on staff or what??

20100731 20:50:08 nbsp Just went to the South Safeway second time after 4 years, (I lived somewhere else and was visiting Davis). I liked the fact that the store still is as nice as it was 4 years ago. Took a club card first from a cashier (who from the dress was at least an Asst. Manager., very helpful and patient. Saved 40 bucks using the card while buying groceries to last for a month (25% saving on the total bill). Groceries were bagged and delivered till the car by a smiling bagger, nice touch. After a 2 day 1700 mile drive, I sure wasnt in a mood to haul my own groceries into the car. Look like I will be visiting this store often in the next few years. Users/snehalt

20100805 18:53:27 nbsp The North Davis Safeway seems to be going back downhill in terms of service and produce selection.  6 or 7 years ago, it was absolutely terrible.  They managed to improve it dramatically, though, and it was perfectly decent for most of the time I was living nearby.  Over the past couple of months, though, Ive fairly regularly run into grumpy or silent employees, horrible management queue management, and poor stocking.  Last week, for example, I was headed to the checkout lines.  There were three lanes open, two of which were 15 items or fewer.  There was one person being checked out in one of those lines, and the other was wide open.  The other lane, with no item limit, had 3 full carts backed up.  I asked the checker in the open lane whether shed take 20ish items.  She said no, 15 item limit.  I was a little annoyed, since she was just standing around.  I got in the back of the normal line, though, and waited my turn.  The lazy checker checked out one person then stood around some more, talking with the other 15item checker who was also freed up.  By that time, the line for the one normal lane was a whopping nine people long, all with full carts.  They actively turned away 3 other people who asked if they could check out with more than 15 items.  Once there were nine people in line, one of them finally said, I guess I should switch to another lane, huh?

Sigh.  I guess I just need to make the trek to Nugget.  I prefer shopping there anyway, its just quite a bit farther. Users/TomGarberson
  The late night people are more friendly in my opinion. Or the early morning. Just whenever is not a prime shopping time. Users/hankim
  Not to defend them, but it might be a principle thing. For example, what if the person behind you had 19 items and then after the 15item attendant checked you out the 19item person asked to also be checked out, and so on. Sometimes they have corporate policies that disallow employees to do things like that. It might even be a possibility that the item limit check out computers actually stop them from ringing up more than 15 items. I have no idea really, but I do find it amusing that people get so impatient when waiting in line at grocery stores. Users/SunjeetBaadkar
   I agree with that, but IMO when there are that many people waiting, they should open up another line (and not wait until their are nine people waiting!).  I get impatient because sometimes I have stuff melting in the cart.  Some ice creamoriented desserts are very temperature sensitive, and milk is another thing I dont like sitting in the cart too long.   Users/CovertProfessor

20100907 20:11:51 nbsp I just went to the North Davis Safeway in the search for some dinner, and the sushi really caught my eye. Yes, it is still in the little plastic boxy packaging that kind of makes it look like those premade Costco sushi things that taste pretty nasty and mushy...but when I looked inside, it looked pretty fresh and legit. The presentation was slightly better than the costco sushis that they used to have and they didnt look like they had been sitting out all day...they actually looked really fresh! The sushi chef was real nice too. I think he might be new? Who knows. But he offered to make something fresh to order for me if I wanted. Well of COURSE! Fresh is always better! So I asked him to make me an Avocado salad roll that I had seen earlier but never tried. It was surprisingly tasty :) Im going back tomorrow to try the sashimi and sushi platter because the prices arent bad at all. Oh plus, I was there around 7:30 at night and this guy was the only person in the deli area still working. So, Im thinking its probably good place to get a quick and tasty dinner in Davis :) Users/jfong252

20110530 00:03:32 nbsp I dont understand why they dont provide more staff at night.  The store is filled with students buying what would appear to be higher margin items.  Tonight it was so bad that I left in frustration.  I think they would increase business considerably if they ensured at least two (and maybe more) checkers at all times.

Also, I dont understand why they dont hire more courtesy clerks.  They can pay them less than half as much as a checker while effectively doubling a checkers speed.

The slow checkout often drives me to Nugget (where I know I pay more, but also know that they will always call more people to check and provide a lot of courtesy clerks rather than having customers wait. Users/RMS

20110611 16:55:02 nbsp I had a terrible experience in the Safeway at North Davis today. There are currently tons of high school students and college students graduating. I went to Safeway today morning at 10AM and asked them politely if they could give me one of those huge graduation balloons. One of the three girls there wasnt even interested in helping and just told me that I would have to wait 10min because they had several orders. I agreed to come back and I decided that since their flowers were ugly looking (Looking sort of about to die, even when we are in an important date where they should have fresh flowers) that I would go to Savemart.

I had to walk all the way to Savemart and found beautiful Leis, flowers, and a big balloon. I bought this and went back to Safeway for the other balloon, and the girl rudely tells me that I have to wait 2030min because they ran out of Helium. Seriously, Safeway should hire people who can give GREAT customer service and treat customers politely. She didnt care that I wasted my time WALKING back from Savemart to Safeway, or that I even went to Safeway in the first place. She didnt even apologize, and just had this attitude of I dont care that you had to wait.

On top of that, for a time when everyone is graduating, Safeway should be prepared to have enough helium tanks and fresh flowers. 10AM and they ran out of Helium? And the girl didnt know this until the last minute? I could have saved my time and gone to Savemart where they are indeed polite and have fresh flowers as well! This girl should be more considerate of others times considering the fact that I had a graduation ceremony to attend. She should have known what she can offer and what she cant. There are super nice people in Safeway, but this time, it was a HUGE fail. I will NOT be returning here to buy flowers/balloons. No sense of good customer service at all.  Users/CC

20110916 20:09:24 nbsp Well it looks like the N. Davis Safeway has its deserved share of bashing.  Im a resident of West Davis and a mom.  I HATE this Safeway.  Ive complained to corporate about the terrible management, but of course, they dont care.  The store is terribly stocked, there are never enough checkers, and the customer service desk is never, ever staffed.  I have to wait ages to return anything, and then I have to go over to the registers and wait in line there too?  Ridiculous!  With so many bad reviews, I wonder why nothing has changed in the 4.5 years Ive lived here.  Davis residents who are fed up with this terrible store should BOYCOTT all Safeways, even though the South Davis Safeway is fine.  We need to get a message to corporate that Davis residents deserve better. Users/SarahHughes

20110925 23:41:34 nbsp North Davis safeway is tiny, and without the self checkout you might as well not even bother going at night because the line for the one check stand will go all the way down an isle.

If you want the basics its fine, but make sure to go before say... 5 pm? Late night (after midnight) is okay too on week days.

Also, if youre in South Davis, pay for your groceries at the self checkout by pouring coins into the coin slot instead of getting ripped off by coinstar, or being limited to Starbucks/Amazon giftcards! Its a little slow so if it starts spitting out your coins just feed them back in after waiting a few seconds and the machine will take them.   Users/sundeimasu

I try to avoid going at night after 10pm because theres this one guy who always works the cash register during this time and he is so rude. He does not greet you or even tries to be friendly.

 I actually find the employees (at least in North Davis) really, really pleasant, and pretty efficient.  The service problems that Ive run into have had to do with understaffing.  Unfortunately, they seem to have cut back on staff in the past 6 months or so.  Prior to 4 or 5 years ago, lines were a minimum of about 10 minutes any time after 4pm.  It got a lot better, but the past half dozen times Ive gone after work there have only been a couple of lanes open and 810 people waiting in each line. Users/TomGarberson

20120621 17:09:16 nbsp I finally wrote to Safeway to complain about the long lines (West Covell store).  With the understanding that we are very privileged in this town to have 2 24 hour stores, its incredible that in a college town, after 9 PM, they always only have one damn checker available (@ West Covell).  Great people working there, just totally understaffed and undersupported.  How many people walk into the store, only to turn right back out and leave after seeing the long line? Wonder how much they lose to other places (like CVS next door), just because they wont keep an additional checker on site between the hours of 9 PM and midnight? Surely the amount would be more than enough to cover the cost of having an extra employee there to help.  I see so many people getting so fed up with this @#$%&, and yet management wont (cant?) do anything.  God forbid you ever have to run to the store for a couple things after 9 PM... better be prepared to be in line for at least 1520 minutes.  Nothing like angering the customers in your community, just to save $40 or so in salary costs.  Save yourself from pain, avoid this store whenever possible... Westlake market is open until 11, and you can get most everything (outside of produce) at the 24 Hr. CVS next door.  Sorry for the rant, just finally got fed up. Users/OldDavis73

  They sure dont... they could really use (at least) one though.  I heard one of the employees mention that there wasnt room for them, I dont know about the validity of that statement.  Plus, you apparently still need 1 additional employee to babysit the selfcheckout... which based on their typical staffing levels, this is something the North (West) Davis store seems to have no interest in doing.

I recently went to the Starbucks in Safeway on Cowell Blvd. I placed my order and the barista, Amy started my drink. While she was preparing my drink I saw her pull back a bloody bandaid to see if one of her fingers was still bleeding. Disgusting. Where do they find these people? During this recession there are plenty of people who are looking for work. It wouldn’t take much effort to find someone with some common decency, hygiene, respect for their job and the customers. Users/Douglasx

20121124 15:37:35 nbsp Using www.wiki.com I searched for an article about the relationship between Coinstar, Redbox, Starbucks and any other ibusiness relationship that Safeway may have generated over the past several years. After all you can’t go into a Safeway or just about any grocery store these days without there being a local bank, a movie rental, and coffee shop within the bounds of the store. This is a perfect example of business going “I”. Safeway was once just a grocery store and with the discovery of a better “one stop shop” for their customers, that’s just what Safeway did.

The wiki that I pulled up described some of the nuances of the two Safeway stores in a small area in northern California called Davis.  There is a store in North Davis at 1431 West Covell Boulevard and another one in South Davis at 2121 Cowell Blvd.  The wiki describes some differences and similarities of the two stores to include the size of the store.  It further explains a typical experience at these stores from the beer selection, the “free try” policy at the deli and bakery, weather you will get offered paper or plastic and even if you can recycle the bags at the front of the store.

This wiki doesn’t necessarily talk about the evolution of Safeway transforming into an ibusiness however it does state that both of the Davis stores have a Coinstar machine, a Redbox DVD, BluRay, and video game rental machine, a Wells Fargo branch and a Starbucks.  This is clearly evolved from the need for the busy consumer to be able to stop at one place and get all your shopping done. These relationships are not symbiotic, however they benefit from each other significantly.

20130118 14:43:37 nbsp NORTH DAVIS SAFEWAY IS THE WORST PLACE TO SHOP IN DAVIS.
Every time I go in there I encounter the same things: LOTS OF LONG LINES. They have 810 checkstands, but only 12 are staffed at any given time. I run into this problem at all hours of the day. Try to stop quickly at 9am? Takes 20 minutes to buy one thing. Going after 5pm? FORGET IT, you will never get out, because there will be at least 2 lines stretching almost to the back of the store. It ALWAYS takes me longer to wait in line to pay for things than it does for me to get all the grocery items I need. In addition to the horrendous wait times, the staff is completely incompetent. They cant figure out how to enter coupons, they dont ring up all your items in one transaction, they mess up the whole transaction and have to redo it, etc. Theyll even stop in the middle of checking you out to call a colleague to their checkstand and then chat with them about leaving something for them in the breakroom, a party the last night, or gossip about some other colleague. Really? You have to do that NOW, with a line of 10 people waiting to finally pay for their groceries so they can leave? And all of this dysfunctional shit occurs every fucking time I go in. So really, just dont go unless you have a LOT of time to waste. Users/mellibean

20130223 20:13:58 nbsp I enjoyed the south Davis Safeway. I especially love the just for you program. I have saved ridiculous amounts of money with the coupons. The only problem is that you need to check the expiration dates on the items you buy, which is pretty tedious. I accidentally bought expired medicine at this location. They exchanged it for me but there were several other packs of expired medicine on the shelf still. Also, their deli chicken is not very tasty. The selfcheckouts were nice.  Users/LoriOrf

20130816 06:15:33 nbsp Im a cashier at CVS and every day I get customers pissed off at Safeway employees because their lines are too long, so they take their business to CVS. I dont appreciate their unkind words about the Safeway staff AT ALL. Every experience Ive ever had at Safeway has been awesome, the employees have always been kind to me as well as helpful. I appreciate their hard work and dedication to a job that treats them like crap. If you have ever worked for a corporation in your life you will understand how difficult it is to receive little to no staff on a daily basis. As a customer you are nothing more than $$$ marks, the sooner you realize that the better.  Users/CatherineOgas

20140114 23:46:30 nbsp I went to the North Davis location once when I used to live in North Davis, and that time I went there, I never experienced the ridiculously long lines that almost everyone above me is talking about. I think I only had to wait about 5 or so minutes behind some people in front of me (who had shopping carts filled to the brim with their groceries) before it was my turn. Now that I live in South Davis, though, I go to their other location, and I agree that it is much bigger and has more selections than N. Davis Safeway.  Users/MichelleNguyen

20140123 13:06:37 nbsp I made the mistake last night of popping in to the North Davis location to get one or two things.  2 lanes open.  No express lane (20 items or less).  Lines 20 people deep.  It is my conclusion, based on observations made over a 3 year period, and after expressing and hearing a myriad of complaints directed to the store manager, that they are simply unwilling (not unable) to make any improvements in customer service.

Again, I have to emphasize that this is (mostly) not a Safeway corporate issue, rather it is the management of this particular store.  I feel bad for the staff (who are very nice) and customers.  Sadly though, it has come to this: I live less than 2 miles away from the North Davis location.  If I want to go to Safeway, I will simply go to the South Davis location.  If they are busy, they will open another check stand.  The manager will come out and bag (with a smile) if it gets busy.  You can use self checkout.  Same company, completely different experience.

My advice is to avoid the North Davis store at all costs.  It will take you longer to wait in line (and make you angrier), than it will to go to any other store in town.  If for some reason you have to visit a store in the Marketplace shopping center, go to CVS. Users/OldDavis73
  I was there last night, too. There was one line and it was practically down the whole aisle. I asked an employee if he could open a second line for everyone and he said he couldnt, but maybe the manager would if I asked. Two reactions to this: First: why should I have to walk around the store looking for the manager instead of getting in this humongous line? Shouldnt the manager be aware of the problem? (So I requested he find the manager instead of me, and he assented, thankfully). Second: why cant this employee open a checkout line? Seriously management, train him on the register (its not hard) and pay him an extra few dollars an hour. The way they run this store isnt fair to the workers and its certainly not fair to the customers. So sick of it. Megan
   It just amazes me how the store manager really cares nothing about angering customers.  How many people have walked out of that store furious, abandoning their potential purchases out of pure and utter frustration? I know it wont likely happen, given its convenient location and those ignorance of (or indifferent to) this issue... I would just like to see some negative financial consequences for this store, based on the managers apathy.  I truly believe thats the only way the issue would be addressed by corporate.

  That must be a Safeway policy, because the ABC does not require asking grumpy 62yearolds for d.o.b. unless they look to be young.

  I have worked in retail before. The computer asks for a date of birth so that it can confirm that you are selling it to a person over 21. If you dont type a date of birth the computer will lock up and the sale will not be completed. The employee could type in a fake date of birth, however if the customer looks under 40 the employee must get a correct date of birth or risk losing his or her job. Users/MaxLucas

20140124 16:23:42 nbsp Usually shopping at the South Davis Safeway is an OK experience.  Not today.  The checkout clerk was really sick, coughing, sniffing and wiping his nose with the back of his hand and then handling and packing my groceries.  Yuck.  The manager should have sent this person home or not allowed them to come to work in the first place.  Its seems to be a total lack of consideration for the health and well being of the community in general and the store customers in particular.  This happened a couple weeks ago at Whole Foods and most everyone working there got sick.  Of course its hard to know how many other people get sick as a result.  The managers can do better than this.  Users/AnnieOakley
