Sagat is the CEO of Crepe House Uni Corporation, USA, which owns the Crepe House Uni franchise in California.

Often mistaken as a male due to her first name and the low tone of her voice over the phone, Sagat would be mentioned on newspaper and magazine articles as a he after phone interviews. She was first featured on Hong Kong Economic Times in 2001 for designing web sites free of charge for nonprofit organizations.

She started her first business in 1999 as a web designer when she was a freshman in college. Later, she owned a European automobile parts import company. She also worked as a computer programmer, a pet groomer, a floral designer, painter/mechanic at a body shop, and lead vocal/guitarist in a band and performed in numerous states.

She is wellknown by her friends as a perfectionist and a germophobic.

Sagat is an animal lover and a proud owner of three dogs, a cat, and a betta fish. One of her dreams is to own an animal shelter for abandoned and stray pets.

Her father was a wellknown chef in Hong Kong, and taught her to cook for the first time when she was at age 5.

Her personal goal is to make the world a better place.

One of her quotes is (recently became a motto of Crepe House Uni), If you dont want it, dont give it to anyone else.

20081007 22:46:54 nbsp Hello Sagat... I just wanted to offer a couple of my bikes to hang in the Crepe House Uni.  I build custom bikes, but specialize in Colorful Fixed Gear Bikes.  Check out my wiki page APEX Cycles.  No charge, just some exposure for me, and more color for your store.  Let me know what you think. Users/Aaron.Curtin

20081020 10:32:57 nbsp Hey Sagat! Thanks again for chatting it up with me while I got a chance to watch you spin! The crepe was SUPER THIN, very enjoyable. Users/StevenDaubert

20081020 22:53:54 nbsp I was outside of uni today and I saw you sitting I yelled hello and waived! Users/StevenDaubert

20081029 00:59:44 nbsp Thats quite a variety of businesses!  How do you decide which business you want to pursue next? Users/IDoNotExist
 I think Uni is by far my favorite, because I get to meet different kinds of people. It is extremely rewarding to see customers smile while enjoying our food and/or hanging out with friends, or just by offering them a place to study/get on the internet. It makes me feel that I am capable of making a lot of people happy. So I think I will stick with the restaurant business for a long time. Users/Sagat

20081029 17:04:01 nbsp How did you wind up in so many different businesses? Users/IDoNotExist
 I just love to learn. I love to gain more knowledge and find out what I am capable of. I always keep an open mind to every single thing and learn from different experiences.

20081030 21:33:23 nbsp Hi Sagat!  My girlfriend and I were in your shop last night and we had the pleasure of tastetesting a new recipe that was being perfected.  Was that you we were talking to? Users/JonathanLawton
 Yes, Jonathan. It was very nice talking to you, and thank you very much for trying our new product and giving us valuable comments. I got a couple customers told me that it would taste better cold. Do you agree? Users/Sagat
  I thought it was good the way it was, but trying it cold would be an interesting experiment since the pie is usually served cold.  Also, the filling is much thicker in pie, my guess is that this occurs during baking?  Playing with the consistency might be interesting, too.  But, really, it was quite good the way it was.  Have you considered a sweet potato pie filling?  That would be also be very Thanksgivingesque.
   Thank you very much! I shall try to make the sweet potato pie and see how that turns out. Users/Sagat

20081101 23:25:17 nbsp can we get a picture of you in one of the UNIforms? Users/StevenDaubert
 May I ask what the picture will be used for? Users/Sagat
Looking at! Maybe even putting on this page with a tagline of Sagat looks good in a UNIform as well! Users/StevenDaubert
 Sure! But well have to wait until January, because my uniform shrunk too much (after being washed so many times) and I am having my new sets made. I need to go pick them up when I travel to Asia in December.

20090120 22:43:52 nbsp I hope that business is going well! I shall do my best to come to your restaurant again as soon as I am able! Users/DanielHill

20090521 16:09:05 nbsp I would like to make a small recomendation regarding the Crepe House Uni page.  The comments section is quite cluttered and seems to be only getting worse.  Perhaps, when responding to commenters, you could put your comments on their user pages instead? Or at least place and indent your entry so that it is abundantly clear to whom you are speaking.  I am going to attempt to prune the comments in such a manner that all comments are still available, but also not overwhelming.  Input on the matter would be appreciated.  Users/MasonMurray

20100327 01:26:14 nbsp Hi Sagat! I was so sad to hear that CHU closed down! I was an avid patron of the business when I was living in Tokyo, but I didnt have the pleasure of visiting the Davis store before it closed! Is there any chance it may return to us? Otherwise I hope business continues to go well for you in Hawaii and Asia.  Users/ArianeMetz
