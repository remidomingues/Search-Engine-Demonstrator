Sals Tacos is a far cry from Ernestos Mexican Food or Zocalo, Sacramentos local chain restaurants that serve trendy CaliMex cooking at inflated prices. Sals is a neighborhood taqueria that just serves your standard platos. The food is fine, but what is truly unique about Sals is the owners mosaic fetish, which he has managed to merge with his Sacramento Kings obsession. From the looks of it, Sals used to be a drive in, ala A&W. Sal Galvan has managed to get away with adding on various seating areas, probably long before West Sacramento was incorporated... back in the Broderick days.

The salsa is fine and the tamales leave much to be desired, but they do serve horchata and beer, which any selfrespecting Mexican restaurant must have available. Otherwise, the food is good but not spectacular, and will run you from $5$10 per entree. Curiously, theres a neon beer sign attached to the ceiling above one booth and parallel to the table, which makes one wonder whether this might be the drunk booth.
