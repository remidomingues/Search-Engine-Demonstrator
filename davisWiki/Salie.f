Hello!  My name is Salie.  I moved here to Davis as an undergraduate but now fully immerse in this community.  I am involved with the Odd Fellows and do a lot of photography.  Please browse my site, I love to take pictures and looking for every opportunity to do so.  Aside from nature and landscape photography I also provide services in model portfolios, family/portraits and events. Thanks for reading!  ~s
