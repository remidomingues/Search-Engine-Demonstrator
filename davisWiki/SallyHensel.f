Im Sally Hensel.  You might know me from my past threeyear stint as cheese gal at Davis Food Coop the best cooperativelyowned grocery store in Davis. Now I think lots about Third Space Art Collective (3SPAC) Third Space.  Maybe weve taken a Film Studies class or Anthropology two together.  Perhaps youve seen me in my Robot Rocket Residence old backyard or my Robotmedia http://youtube.com/watch?valjvbTwxNYQ thing.  Or maybe weve just seen each other around.  Hello to you, reader of this daviswiki page.

I call Davis home.  (But I grew up in Fresno, like http://imdb.com/name/nm0001603 Sam Peckinpah!)

Also, Im so halfJapanese I dont even know what to do with myself.

Ive had my bike stolen THREE times in Davis.  Where did those bikes go?

20050513 03:00:05 nbsp The arlen theory is pretty much this: make a page that is likely to piss someone off and let them fix it later. it is a weird yet effective way to get new people involved in the wiki. Users/RobRoy

20050513 08:30:32 nbsp This probably isnt the place to discuss the arlen theory but whatever. In my experience, more people are turned off completely from the wiki than are encouraged to start participating. Proof in point might be that so many of the pages are still around. When I flyer or otherwise publicize the wiki Ive heard multiple times oh yeah, thats the place they talk shit about things. my. 02 Users/JackHaskel
