20070810 21:41:19 nbsp Aubrey Suleiman, the owner and stylist, is really great.  Ive sometimes come in with specific ideas, sometimes without any ideas at all about what I want, and Ive never once had a bad haircut with her.  Shes super nice, too.   Users/CatherineFung

20090715 18:38:02 nbsp Aubrey is amazing! I have thick unruly hair and she did an amazing job adding all these layers and really making it beautiful. Shes super nice and friendly and knows what shes doing with a pair of scissors. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! ) Users/JenniferGreen

20091001 12:25:03 nbsp Casey Callahan is amazing!  I am a man with long curly hair and she is the only person I would trust with my hair.  I tried a couple of places in town after being let down by letting my family members deal with my hair I gave up.  It was only after letting my hair grow for more than a year that I would let somebody touch it again and that somebody is Casey.  She rules.  Get your hair cut by her today! Users/Ericmoose

20091028 17:44:07 nbsp Aubreys been cutting my hair for four or five years, and her work is exceptional. I cant imagine anyone doing a better job. Shes given me breakup haircuts, celebration haircuts, Ineedtochangedirection haircuts... I hope Salon Blonde continues to grow and support her well.  Users/calvin2

20100216 12:27:44 nbsp I got a haircut with Casey one week ago and I am extremely happy with the results. I was looking for a big change and wanted her input on the style that would work for me. We decided to cut about 6 inches and to add layers to emphasize my natural wave. I left thinking it looked great and crossed my fingers that it would look great when I did it myself  and it does! My hair looks so much better than it did before she cut it and also better than it ever has when cut in similar styles in the past. Casey was very friendly and accommodating. She didnt mind that I had to bring my baby with me and was very patient when I had to get up to take care of the baby occasionally. Users/RachelD

20100414 12:55:39 nbsp I got a cut from Casey Callahan at Relay for Life when I donated hair to Locks of Love. This is the best haircut I have ever had. I just told her to have fun with it and I have never been happier with a haircut. Ive got fairly curly hair and this cut cannot look bad!! Users/BrendaDeely

20110203 14:09:21 nbsp I love this place.  I have had my hair cut here 3 times and have been happy with every cut.  Casey did a beautiful job and I left feeling great.  I cant afford to go to the salon every month and she cuts my hair so it still looks good as it grows!  I will be back and recommend this shop to anyone who wants their hair to look good! Users/Britva613

20120202 13:07:35 nbsp I usually dread getting my hair cut, but I give this place 5 stars our of 5. My stylist was Casey and she put me at ease and had some god ideas for my hair. I love my cut! This place is really lowkey, but professional which I love. Definitely going back next soon! $45 and worth every penny.

20120210 21:46:21 nbsp Liz Robson is my go to gal! Im constantly changing my hair color, practically every month, and Liz always does an amazing job. Whether Im going dark or light, and she is the fastest stylist Ive ever had to do a highlight! Usually it takes almost 5 plus hours with other stylist, Liz can usually get it done in about 2 & it always looks amazing! She also has really great & affordable pricing! Im never going to anyone else!!  Users/LaurenMcNamara

20120218 19:50:08 nbsp Liz Robson has just done the most fabulous job on my hair!!! I am so picky and like natural hair products and she made that happen for me!
I am a mom and full time student, so getting my hair done feels like going to a spa with a gentle touch and personal care!!
I have been coming here since last year and wont go any where else!!!

20120510 12:20:37 nbsp Casey Callahan has been cutting my hair for years. When another place butchered my hair, she turned it into the best cut I could have imagined. Shes a expert with color, a genius with the bright, funky colors. Users/SovietSonya

20121029 12:15:00 nbsp I get my eyebrows waxed and hair cut by Casey and she is the best! Shes patient with me when I try to do my own eyebrows and screw them up and shes accomodating to my crazy work schedule when Im desparate for a hair cut. Shes great with color too and my hair is always so healthy because of her care. I never get a bad hair cut here and she always offer to fix it if I dont like it, but thats never been necessary. The other ladies in the salon are so friendly and kind. Users/ChardaeJones

20121130 15:37:43 nbsp Liz is the best. I started going to her in June, and got a pixie cut for the first time. She spent a lot of time looking at the pictures I had brought, discussing what was best, and then afterwards recommending what types of products to use in my new hair. Ive gotten countless compliments on my haircut, both from strangers and friends/family. She also offers complimentary neck and bang trims  I just went for a neck trim and she went above and beyond, cleaning up not only my neck but around my ears. Highly recommend! Users/MeggoWaffle

20130722 11:36:17 nbsp Liz is fabulous!!!  I went to her for a pixie after reading the reviews here and was not disappointed!  She talked with me before and during the cut, to make sure we were on the same page, and she spent a long time to help me work out what would look best on my face shape, and I think also because I was wanting it very short but never had it that way before, etc. and she was just great.  She also did my color and made really insanely fine thin foils.  I couldnt even tell where they were placed.  Took forever but was worth it, my hair looked so fabulous.  Got loads of compliments.  Am glad to have found her. Users/JessS

AWESOME EXPERIENCE.

I was quite nervous as it was my first time getting my hair dyed. I wanted the lower half of my hair to be a light blue/teal, but then Liz suggested to go with a more darker purplebased because itll last longer. The process didnt take too long (a little under two hours). She was patient with me and she was very thorough. She knew was she was doing! The blue is an extremely pretty color. Liz mixed in different blues and omg the color came out so freaking awesome. It looks amazing in the sun :D Thank you, Lizzzz! Cant wait to come back here for another color (:
