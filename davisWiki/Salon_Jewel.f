20120808 17:08:28 nbsp I attempted to get a mani/pedi at Salon Jewel but was unsuccessful. I sat in the waiting area for over 10 minutes but was never acknowledged by the staff. Despite being noticed by 3 people working there, I never received a May I help you?, Someone will be with you in a second, or Sorry, this is an appointment only establishment. I guess they dont want new customers.

On an unrelated note, their indoor decor is cute, but the outdoor sign advertising the salon is nearly impossible to see from the parking lot. The whole set of buildings look more like  apartments than stores or office buildings.  Users/LSquared
