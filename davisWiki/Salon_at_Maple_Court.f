Formerly known as Hair Saloon, Salon at Maple Court was a Beauty Salons and Barber shops beauty salon, offering haircuts, hair color, and hair texturizing. The building was remodeled during the last year of the salons tenure.

Sharon Jackson opened her salon 7 years ago with friend Sherri Cowden. After Ms. Cowden sold her half of the salon it was owned soley by Sharon Jackson (Gamble). The salon personnel then consisted of Sharon, Cecilia Scott, David Martin, and Tenaya Freitas. Sharon, Cecilia, David, and Tenaya all have extensive training in cuts, color, colorcorrection, and hair texturizing.

The stylists at Salon at Maple Court would often help clients with High Fashion Color, Foils, Weddings Wedding work, Photography Photo Styling and the latest in Avant Garde looks.  Their aim was to offer a friendly, sunny atmosphere.

The salon closed in January of 2010 because their lease was not renewed (the spot was taken over by Lil Bit Sassy), and the 4 stylists moved to Cobalt Salon & Gallery.

A short documentary telling the story of business owners Sharon Gamble and Sherri Cowden and their dream to own a hair salon in Davis, was featured at the 2005 Davis Film Festival. The film is called “Common Hours,” by Elaine King.

20080109 11:13:47   Kelli (now working in Sacramento) does a super job! She is professional yet friendly and casual. If you want a good haircut and style in a salon that isnt pretentious or overpriced (but also not bargainbasement), this is the place. —users/NoelBruening
