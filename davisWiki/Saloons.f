A saloon was a type of bars bar popular in the American West prior to the Prohibition. There were many saloons in Davisville up until 1911 when they were finally banned due largely to the efforts of the Womens Christian Temperance Union. Many of the saloons had bad reputations and were associated with violent crime in particular. Two saloonkeepers were shot in the head by angry customers on separate occasions, but both somehow survived and made full recoveries.
