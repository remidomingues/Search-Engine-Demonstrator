 Background 

Salt & Battery was a Aggie Cartoons comic strip in The California Aggie which ran from January 2005 through June 2006.  Drawn by Hunter Lower, the comic featured two main characters: Hunter himself and a fictional comicrelief character named Super, who wore a cape and had various super powers. The style of Salt & Battery was mostly random observational humor without any kind of recurring story between published strips.

The strip first ran in January, 2005.  It was originally drawn in pen on paper, then shaded in Photoshop.  When the strip was recomissioned for the 0506 school year, it switched to mostly shaded pencil drawings.

The last regular strip ran in the Aggie on June 5th, 2006.  Although technically a short, experimental story arc continued in the newspaper through the summer of 2006, this is not considered by the cartoonist to be an actual part of the Salt & Battery series.
