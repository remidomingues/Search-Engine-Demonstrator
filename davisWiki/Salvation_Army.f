There is no longer a store in Davis.


The store that used to be in Davis was quite quaint.  You could usually find great deals on bikes and other random, and I mean random, house wares. The store, its customers, and employees were kept in the dark about the closing of the store until two weeks before it closed. They were then told that they would either be working in the Sacramento store or the one in Woodland.

Users/Jondsouza and Users/Lisadavis were looking at the space to make it into a venue for music and art. The space that the store used to occupy was recently bought by neighboring store Little Prague and will be an expansion to the restaurants space.

The Sacramento store is much larger in size with a much larger inventory. The prices are also cheaper. Great place to find cheap couches, tables, and costumes for a I Love the 80s theme party.
