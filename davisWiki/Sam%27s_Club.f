Part of the empire that includes WalMart, Sams Club is similar to Costco as it is a giant warehouse of glory, selling many things in large bulk quantities. Great for buying food for parties, such as chips and salsa. But sometimes items arent as varied as you would find at other stores. Shampoo, for instance, will only come for fine hair at Sams while Target or Safeway will have many types; for oily, dry, or mosturizing or volumizing, etc.

It is worth noting (if you care about such things) that Sams Club ranks very low in terms of employee satisfaction and benefits, while competitor Costco welcomes unions and negotiates employee agreements every three years even in nonunionized stores, resulting in one of the best reputations for employee benefits and care.
