Sams offers arguably the best falafel in Davis, and really friendly employees.  It seems to be an authentic familyowned and run restaurant. On Mondays, if you order the falafel you get a free soft drink!  This is an incredible thing and should not be missed. On the walls inside Sams is a painting of a Mediterranean countryside.  They also serve very good cheeseburgers, hummus, dolma, baklava, and shawarma. They play Arabic music as well, which as we all know is the best music in the entire world.

Everything on the menu is halal food. They might be the best halal serving restaurant in Davis and also might be the best restaurant in Davis Halal or not.

Sams is a block away from Ali Baba, which is also on 3rd Street  offering similar but different food(they have one halal food which is made of lamb also).  Some swear by Sams, some by Ali Baba.  Users/CovertProfessor Some people perversely insist on liking both.

Sam is also known to give frequent customers some leeway if they find themselves short on cash, giving a free meal or taking an IOU.

Menu and Specials
Every weekday they have a special dish, it comes with a free drink.

20090228 14:51:04 nbsp That is a HUGE complement for Sams!  Ali owns Sams direct competitor, Ali Baba. Users/IDoNotExist
  Lucky for us they are both great places to eat!   Users/CovertProfessor

20090228 19:25:38 nbsp I completely agree.  Both are great.  :) Users/IDoNotExist

20090228 19:48:03 nbsp I LOVE the shawarma. I eat here almost once a week. Users/MattBlair

20090305 13:21:57 nbsp This place is great.  I just recently discovered it and Ive already had the chicken shawarma, chicken kabob, and falafels  they were all delicious.  I just left the place and Im already trying to plan out my next visit to Sams.  Way to go! Users/j0liefllle

20090308 16:09:03 nbsp I love it here!  The food is great and the workers are so polite.  Id choose Sams over Ali Baba any day. Users/strawberry

20090405 17:02:30 nbsp The cheeseburger here is to die for. The food is relatively inexpensive. The staff is also nice. Beef schawarma is my number 2 favorite.  Users/JanethN.

20090409 19:39:44 nbsp I really like it here, the food is great but I wish they would not close earlier than the stated time :/ Users/melah

20090815 22:19:53 nbsp Beef Shawarma with spicy tahini sauce is always my choice Users/lajolla4joya

20090822 17:14:24 nbsp Menu is small and limited.  I had the beef shawarma.  It was delicious.  It was a little more expensive than I had hoped for, but it was still pretty tasty.  Will be returning.   Users/BenLee

20091013 12:31:41 nbsp Best PALESTINIAN food in Davis!!!!!!! chicken shawarma with yogurt is my favorite. the shawarma over rice is really good and really filling also.

 Users/daviswikiuser2006

20091031 18:11:20 nbsp The chicken shwarma, fries and hummus are all really great at this place. That being said, I think Id go twice as often if Sams introduced some sort of sampler platter that had a combination of smaller portions. As the menu is now, you have to order hummus or dolmas or falafel, etc. Each is a meal by itself.  Users/DavisCritics

20100104 15:32:11 nbsp I had the Falafel today and it was really good and comes in a HUGE pita. For $5.43, it kept me going for the rest of the day. It was really moist and from just coming back from New York over winter break, it is comparable to the east coast. Seems like everyone ordered the chicken schwarma though while I was waiting for my food, probably will give it a try next time. :)  Users/MissAmyQ

20100121 15:33:20 nbsp Sams is one of my favorite restaurants (not just in Davis) and I think that they have the best hamburger in town. I know for a fact that they have the best french fries in all of yolo county.

That said, everyone who works at Sams (especially Sam himself) is extremely nice. One of the happiest places in Davis. Users/Mr.Mateo

20100122 23:29:54 nbsp I went here once in December and a friend suggested the Chicken Sub, DELICIOUS! I went again today and had the Chicken Shawarma with yogurt and spicy. The young lady taking my order was very friendly and nice (assuming Sams daughter because she said something about Dad to him), when she asked if I wanted tahini or yogurt, I said spicy and she said, okay but do you want more sesame or yogurt has cucumber or something to that effect. Anyways, being that I dont know much about the food, she was super at explaining it. The Chicken Shawarma was also AWESOME!! Id highly reccomend this place, and prices arent outrageous. Users/redbike

20100307 19:39:02 nbsp i am addicted to this place! i could eat a chicken shawarma w tahini all day every day! love goin there cuz everyone is so friendly & makes me feel so welcome! Users/cparnell

20100323 10:22:17 nbsp Thanks for filling the holes in the back!! Users/Missy415

20100414 14:37:41 nbsp I frikkin love their falafels! Users/thisisht

20100425 11:26:11 nbsp SAMS has the best pita sandwiches within a 50 mile radius. They are enormous and absolutely fresh and delicious, priced at around $5.50. The girl that runs the counter is super cute and also very sweet. Honestly, I am a huge food snob and their swharma pitas are one of my favorite foods ever, ask for both sauces! Its amazing! Users/mollyringwald

20100430 15:01:38 nbsp I went here for the first time and the food was very delicious.Chicken shawarma made my day,will go back and try more on the menu and not to forget awesome service with a smile. Users/jasen

20100521 15:54:11 nbsp Great place. I had their chicken shawarma today and for a small price, it was a good portion.  Users/psychstudent

20100730 18:39:16 nbsp Mmmm, this is good. I came here yesterday for lunch and had the beef shawarma and it was so good I stayed longer with my laptop and had a falafel also. I <3 Sams!!!! Users/NickSchmalenberger

20101031 12:13:43 nbsp This is definitely my favorite place to go in Davis. Its a shame theyre closed on Sundays and only take cash though. I recently tried their turkey burger and it was very good. I also prefer their burgers over Burgers and Brew. Their shwarmas are delicious as well but their beef shwarmas taste nothing like beef. Is it fake or lamb? It is still good though! Users/Kenny0427

20101215 01:18:14 nbsp Friendly, and quick. I had the chicken shawarma over rice, and it wasnt as good as I hoped for, but my bf absolutely loved it. Next time I go Ill probably just get the shawarma sandwich because it seems like the most popular item, for good reason Im sure.  Users/jwieland1989

20110106 18:43:52 nbsp Absolutely love the chicken shawarma and chicken sub!!!  Tried the cheeseburger recently as I have seen many positive comments here on the wiki, it was good. I do prefer the chicken shawarma or sub, but the cheeseburger was good.  Fries, of course, are yummy! Users/redbike

20110113 13:24:08 nbsp Love this place. I usually get falafel with the spicy sauce and have never had a bad experience. The owners/workers are always patient and kind. The chicken kabob & beef shawarma are also great. While I still love Ali Babas Aggie Kabob, Sams falafels are much moister and tastier.Still cash only. Users/Sar58

20110213 23:04:57 nbsp chicken shawarma on a pita is soo delicious... wish they accepted credit cards... Users/tneeley

20110302 00:15:23 nbsp Tasty food and good people. Cant go wrong!!! Users/thelonepiper555

20110416 17:58:22 nbsp I didnt even know about this place until today! Im really loving the chicken shawarma!
The fries are good too! Im surely coming back here!
p.s. The portion to me was pretty big! Ate half for lunch and the rest for dinner and was satisfied ;) Users/LuuKyu

20110423 11:46:25 nbsp The best shwarma around. When my brother visits from San Francisco he always insists on going to Sams, as he says its even better than any shwarma in the cityget both tahini and tzatziki on your shwarma. Great customer service here as well. Users/BrentKago

20110426 18:57:36 nbsp Sams restaurant has the best food in town bar none.  They are very generous with their portions, and use only the freshest ingredients.  The service is always very quick; and, the staff is very friendly and personable.  They have plenty of tables outdoors under the shade.

20110529 17:03:55 nbsp If I ever leave Davis, Ill miss Sams beef shawarma the most.  Users/ChristyMarsden

20110617 13:33:01 nbsp F#ck I like this place! We get the Shawarmas with both sauces and are never disappointed. It totals out to around $14 for two people and is a lot of deliciousness. My vegetarian friends (bleh) swear by the falafel. They put hot sauce on it if you ask.  Users/MikeyCrews

20110822 07:26:06 nbsp Love the Shwarmas, the fries, and the friendly service. Sams has become a sort of comfort food for me as I seem to return here right before a big midterm or final. Users/KurtG

20110901 11:07:27 nbsp Their hours have changed and they now close at 7:30pm. I was sold on Sams but because I went there at 7:35pm yesterday they were closed so I went across the street to Ali Babas for the first time. That was very good too. We often eat a little later, especially when its hot so Ill be at Ali Babas more often now. Also... its confusing that they have decreased their hours just as the students are starting to come back for the academic year. Users/BorgilVino

20110923 10:51:22 nbsp @ BorgilVino  It does seem odd that Sams would cut their hours as the students come back but it could be because they simply dont get much business in the evening.  When students want to eat in downtown at night, they usually go to the center of it (Woodstocks, Burgers N Brew, etc).  Id be willing to bet that a lot of Sams business comes from students going from campus to downtown during the day.

As for my review, I used to go only to Ali Baba for their falafel but over the last few months, Ive noticed that the falafel there has become mushy in the center, whereas I like the more cooked, dry falafel that can be found at Sams.  I ALWAYS get the spicy falafel, you just cant go wrong.  Ill be trying the Shawarma today!

20120207 23:00:39 nbsp This comment is long over due, but I just created my daviswiki account.  Ive been picking up lunch for myself and coworkers(uhm...and dinner) from Sams a couple times per week for the past few months.  I cannot comment on the other food because I am addicted to the shawarma.  It is unbelievably good I got my wife hooked to.  The owner and staff are very friendly and run a great business.

Quick Tip: Opening time is listed as 11:00 AM...but, if youre looking to get a jump on your lunch break, give them until about 11:15 or 11:20 to open the doors. Dont panic they are not out of shawarmas. Users/gmca642

20120505 02:35:19 nbsp This place is delicious! I miss this when Im on summer vacation.. Users/AndreaA

20120516 21:33:44 nbsp I had never had a shawarma before, so I wasnt sure what to expect. I ordered the beef shawarma and my girlfriend had the chicken shawarma. The cashier was very nice and friendly and when he asked what sauce we wanted, we told him we had never had a shawarma before and asked for his recommendation. We had tahini with the beef and cucumber yogurt with the chicken. It was delicious. Both shawarmas were amazing combinations of savory meat, crisp vegetables, and tasty sauce in a warm pita. I have to say the beef shawarma pulled slightly ahead of the chicken because it was seasoned so well, but I would recommend both. The service is really fast and we had our shawarma within 5 minutes of ordering. They also have baklava and my girlfriend said it was great.

Given the amount and quality of the  food for the price, this was an amazing deal. Ill definitely be back soon for another shawarma.  Users/AlexHirsch
 Yep. I think if I had to choose one food item in Davis, it would be Sams Chicken Shawarma, both sauces, extra spicy.  users/mikeycrews

20120609 09:36:19 nbsp I love their prices! And the people there are so damn wonderful and friendly! <3 Users/AnnaF

20130223 09:16:18 nbsp The food here is awesome, Sam is the nicest guy in the world too.  Support this place!  Users/bunsey

20130711 10:13:55 nbsp The best food and restaurant in Davis.  The food is cheap and consistently excellent.  The fries are subpar about 50% of the time but the meats are perfect.  The cash only option is annoying but something I get used to for Farmers etc.  I wish they would accept foursquare or another noninvasive payment option.  Does Sams do catering? Users/shraken
  Yes, Sams will do catering.   Users/CovertProfessor

20130801 18:20:01 nbsp This is a place serving very very delicious foods with very good prices. The prices in the April 15 2011 menu are still the same. Also why andbody didnt mention I dont know but all foods of this place are halal. I think the best place for the halal food in Davis as I have seen so far. Users/BatuhanBahadır

20140209 21:55:10 nbsp Ive been here a few times, and the service is great. I LOVED the beef shawarma, but the chicken one was okay. Would love to come back! :)
 Users/YoungResident

20140615 16:00:39 nbsp Awesome family owned place, which is reflected in the personal service! The shawarma is amazing and the falafel is pretty tasty too! If only they were open on weekends... Users/IdaFischer

20140730 11:06:33 nbsp The food here is amazing.  Ive been coming for YEARS, and it has always been consistent in flavor, in size, and in price.  They do not skimp at Sams!  My favorite is their beef shawarma with both tahini+yogurt+spicy sauces.   Users/j0liefllle
