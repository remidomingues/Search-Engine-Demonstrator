20070719 22:57:30 nbsp Hi! I wanted to add to something to what Users/Davidlm mentioned in his last message to you. As a loyal client, you would be one of the best people to expand on the services Spa Central offers (currently there are only a few pictures and not much more). Also, yes, there may be bitingif not vindictivecomments on many pages, but if I am like some other dwiki users, a few things about Users/ElisaWellers comment will stand out: first, its very angry (and not just the Oh, my soup was cold and the waiter forgot to refill my water kind of angry). Second, shes a new user (blank User page). This combo would prompt me to check her other http://daviswiki.org/Users/ElisaWeller?actionuserinfo contributions where we find. . . well, there are no others. Just two attacks against one business. Granted, not everyone will check every dubious comment (though it only takes a few clicks to do), but some may. For the rest, a nice positive Reviews review would likely suffice. Users/KevinChin
