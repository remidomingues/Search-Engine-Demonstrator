 Sam I am! 

I graduated from UC Davis in 2004 with a BA in Anthropology and a minor in English.  I stayed in Davis for two years after that (work and play...you know), but recently moved to Portland, OR. to live the big city life.  I used to live in The 230 with the hottest bunch of women in Davis.  It was probably the best year of all six, and to say that I miss the girls very much would be an understatement.  Davis, you are loved.

20050325 14:17:32 nbsp Sam, remember to preview before you save  saving too much ties up the server. Also, be sure and tell us what you change with the comment box. Users/ArlenAbraham

20081021 22:07:37 nbsp Hi Samantha...just completely new to Davis Wiki and wikis in general except for Wikipedia....stumbled accidentally on your page and thought you might enjoy checking out my website (Im not spamming, I swear!) and Im not sure if its okay even to put in a live link here but go to handsonsnakes dot com.  Im over in Sonoma County and helping my friend Julie get her wiki up for her massage school.  (massage therapy institute) I have a few snake good stories on my site...I like yoma, reverse okatees are my fave corn...we have a reptile bazaar over in petaluma and I know you guys have BARS over here....I saw a great herp lecture about 15 years ago in Davis with a couple of great big northern pines....pines and bulls and milks/large kings and rats are my favorite. Just putting together my profile now here.  cheers! Users/DouglasHall
