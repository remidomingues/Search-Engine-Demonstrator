I just visited Dr. Samers office for a regular checkup and was so pleased with my experience, I thought Id tell all you other people struggling to find a good dentist who takes SHIP insurance.  The first time I went to this office (he shares with James Childress, DDS), Dr. Samer was just starting out and did the cleaning himself and it was generally a fine experience.  Now, there are excellent hygienists who are in charge of the cleanings, and Dr. Samer comes in at the end to do a professional inspection for cavities etc.  My hygienist, Deirdre, was great: very thorough, knowledgeable and informative.  She also was generally friendly, if not a little talkative.  But who knows, maybe that helps distract people who dont enjoy all the scraping and prodding.  Though I walked away with 3 cavities, the front office was helpful in guiding me through the insurance details and giving me a clear printout of prices that I could expect to pay for everything on followup visits.  Beware, however, this office is not for the faint of heart.  They use ultrasonic techniques to start, but then a serious amount of manual scraping. I personally dont mind, as Id rather know that my teeth and gums are wellcleaned.  But Im sure this would bother some people.  In general, I highly recommend this office to anyone looking for a qualified dentist. Users/KatherineMacLean

20080430 16:48:42 nbsp I liked all the people here, but I have found that there are two types of dentists: Those who want to fix everything, and those who will wait on minor problems. I prefer the waitandsee approach, but Dr. Samer falls into the former category, so I dont think Im going to stick with him. Users/JoePomidor

20080430 16:59:40 nbsp Love Dr. Samer.  I went to Dr. Samer after not having dental insurance for four years.  I was so anxious about my visit and was extremely worried about my teeth.

Hes knowledgeable and professionals.  I highly recommend him. Users/CurlyGirl26

As a specialist in town, I have worked with Dr. Samer for over 7 years and appreciate his gentle and caring manner along with his comprehensive and sophisticated knowledge of modern dentistry. The dental work I have seen him perform in patients has always been excellent and the work he has performed on me personally has been awesome and much appreciated. Users/DavidJolkovsky

20090303 19:44:26 nbsp Dr Samer does a great job!  Very professional, did a great job on my cavity fillings.  They are uptodate on technology too, with digital xray equipment and an intraoral dental camera. Users/JTan

20130326 18:45:40 nbsp This guy is GREAT! I saw Dr. Samer (as he is known) for the first time today.  I had not gone to a dentist for 2 years because of horrible anxiety about pain and suffering after some pretty nasty experiences.  I knew I was in for some ugly news today. Dr. Samer was beyond patient with my prattling, nervous chatter.  He took all the time in the world to explain my options for a painless cleaning, and was not at all hesitant to offer me nitrous oxide, even for a simple cleaning.  He did a very thorough workup using the most modern techniques and personally measured my vitals and administered the nitrous.  His RDA did a great, painless cleaning job, and he then met with me to work out a treatment plan that would accomodate my busy schedule and international travel.  He is an excellent communicator, and I am not the least bit worried about seeing him next week for an extraction (gulp) and 2 temporary crowns.  Highly, highly recommended. Users/FreddieOakley
