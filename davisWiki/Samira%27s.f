20071106 14:47:32 nbsp I would shop here if it didnt smell like mothballs and mildew...  Users/Shelly

20071204 20:12:12 nbsp Shelly: the distinct odors in the shop come from the silks as well as the dyes used for the clothes. We carry about equal quantities of rayon, cotton, and silk textiles. There being such a great quantity of silk, the smell becomes quite noticeable, unlike when youre dealing with only one piece at a time. As far as the dye, the smell is greatly diminished when we steam the clothes before putting them on the floor. But since we cant put every piece through a washing machine, the smell cant be completely eliminated. Congratulations on your great nose! Most people dont notice the silk smell even when we point it out. Users/StephanieStudebaker

20080518 00:32:20 nbsp Cute shop, but the dye on the dress I just bought is rubbing off. Bad sign........... Users/eda

20080601 21:17:48 nbsp Eda: Many of the clothes in our shop are quite saturated with excess dye, especially the batiks and indigos. We recommend washing everything in cold water and hanging to dry to get rid of excess dye. Like I said in reply to Shellys comment, the smell (and concomitantly the amount of excess dye) is reduced or eliminated with washing, but we dont have the facilities or resources to wash every piece of clothing that comes through the store. Its worth a mention that if the dress you bought was dyed with indigo, it will continue to rub off, since indigo dye is lessthanpermanent. Users/StephanieStudebaker

20080726 13:19:41 nbsp My favorite place to buy any type of clothing! whether its formal wear, yoga wear, casual wear, they have it all and its all organic ecofriendly material, for REASONABLE prices.  including some really cute and comfy mary janes right now.   Users/KatieD

20080923 20:21:44 nbsp Katie, thanks for the recommendation and Im glad you like our stuff! I should make the disclaimer that although we carry natural fiber clothing, not everything is organic. We do carry Blue Canoe (which is organic) and Liberty Graphics (we usually stock a few of their organic cotton designs) brands for those who are looking for organic options. Cheers!
