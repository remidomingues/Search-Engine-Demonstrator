Then describe the Wiki Animals animal here!

We adopted our sweet Sammy in November 2011 from Yolo County SPCA.  Initially quite shy, Sammy now loves playing with dogs her size (usually at Toad Hollow) as well as running through puddles, destroying anything that squeaks, and will gladly go through her entire bag of tricks for a treat (hopefully chopped hotdog/lunchmeat). When she is not doing one of the aforementioned activities, youll find her sleeping/snoring for 19 hours/day (approx), usually under the ottoman.  Her feet also smell like corn chips/popcorn!
