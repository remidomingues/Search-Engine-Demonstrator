This is a sample net post for Wiki Promotion on the internet.

{{{Hello!

I’m writing to invite you to check out DavisWiki.org

DavisWiki is a place to record Davis culture, places, spots — everything!
This is an experiment in community and a project that will be fruitful for years to come.

Anyone can edit the wiki. Anyone can contribute, change, and add without knowing
anything about websites. Most websites you go to are static — you only read them.
This is a very different place.

DavisWiki has already become a stupendous success, making it the best place to find out what is going
on in Davis.

If you are interested in leaving your mark on the fastestgrowing community resource
in Davis or simply want to learn more about our beautiful city, come visit DavisWiki.org

Have a great day!}}}


  This is mostly an amalgamation of different stuff from the wiki. Im going to SPAM Facebook and some email listservs with it. Maybe itd make a good flyer as well. Any input?  Users/JackHaskel
  Stress that it gets better the more people contribute/diversity of opinion?  Also, bragging about hits is lamesauce because most people have no idea how that sort of thing translates.  I think if youre going to get people on facebook and listservs to know about it you should try to slightly personalize the message  e.g. mention a topic that they would be interested in?
   Agreed. Want to edit it?
