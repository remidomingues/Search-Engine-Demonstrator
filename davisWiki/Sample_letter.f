Below is a sample letter to hand out to people when tabling, etc.  Current pdf found http://daviswiki.org/cool_files/what_is_davis_wiki.pdf here.

What is Davis Wiki?
Davis Wiki is a Davisoriented Web site located at DavisWiki.org. Davis Wiki is a nonprofit, communitydriven effort to create a resource for anything relating to Davis. As a unique twist, anyone can edit the Web site. That means you can contribute new information, add to previous content, or actually change previous content! You can only read most other websites. Davis Wiki is a very different place.

We record Davis culture, places, spotseverything! This is a community experiment, a fruitful project to archive all that is old and new in Davis. So, go grab your camera and find something! Write a review of your favorite place. Tell us about a fun thing to do on Tuesdays. Provide a picture of your street. The topics are endless. Daviswiki.org is what Davis means to Davis.

I can edit DavisWiki.org?
Yes, you can!  Because anyone can edit Davis Wiki, that means that it is constantly growing, changing, and improving. All material on the site is created by Davis community members like yourself who donate a few minutes/hours to improve the site. Explore DavisWiki.org, sign up, and start contributing knowledge, information, and opinion.  The more people who contribute to the site, the better it will become!

Do I need to know HTML or something?
Davis Wiki uses a simplified code, so you dont need to know anything about HTML or how Web sites work. Editing and creating pages is simple. Most editing is as simple as typing an email. Just click Edit on a page and begin typing!

If anyone can edit the Web site, doesnt that mean it will be vandalized?
The Davis Wiki works on the principle that there are more good people than bad people. It is just as easy to restore a page as it is to vandalize it.  Because vandalism doesnt stick around for more than a minute or two, it doesnt persist. Attempts at vandalism are useless, because a mature and caring community focuses on keeping this site focused and useful.

Who started this thing?
Davis Wiki was started by two UCD undergraduatesMike Ivanov and Philip Neustromon October 27th, 2004.
