At Samplistic Records, we are committed to publishing electronic music that we believe to be original, interesting, explorative and engaging. We  will never underestimate the listeners intelligence and are committed to bringing the highest level of detail through our recordings. Music is a form of communication and our mission is, not to be the biggest, but to produce worthwhile idiosyncratic music with the understanding that we indeed can please some of the people, all the time.
