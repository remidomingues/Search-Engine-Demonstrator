Hello Samuel.

Given that youve made an unusually big number of edits  about 130 on the same page so far today  and without any comments, Im wondering if you know that you can click to preview your changes, then scroll down the page to view them, then scroll back up to continue editing. Users/BruceHansen

Yes, Im aware. Thanks Bruce.
