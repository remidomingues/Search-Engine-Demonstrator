wiki:sf San Francisco is a large city some seventy miles from Davis. SF is in many ways the heart of the Bay Area. Many students, tiring of the The Dairy bucolic existence offered by Davis this town, gaze longingly westward. San Francisco is often called the City by residents of Northern California. Calling SF Frisco is a http://www.notfrisco.com/nortoniana/notfrisco.html high misdemeanor and will result in a hefty fine of $25, payable to 5505 Discordian Convergence the Imperial Treasury. Most folks will figure out what youre talking about, no matter which way you refer to San Francisco.  Its a huge place with many different kinds of people.

 Things to Do 

 Class A Tourist Traps 
  Alcatraz  Go once
  Ghirardelli Square  also avoidable. Visit, sample, and go buy identical chocolates at the local Safeway for less money.  The hot cocoa at the restaurant is pretty darn tasty on a chilly day, though.
  Fishermans Wharf  Tacky tourist shops and overpriced seafood on Pier 39, you can do better practically anywhere else in the city. Pier 23 has the http://www.ssjeremiahobrien.org/ S.S. Jeremiah OBrien and the http://www.maritime.org/pamphome.htm USS Pampanito, both very cool. The OBrien is especially cool when the engine is running.
  Union Square  It was pretty much destroyed when the Powers redid it in 2001 to make it less attractive to protesters, etc.  There is some excellent food right there, though.  If you feel like leaving your life savings behind, try http://lecolonialsf.com/ Le Colonial.
  Lombard Street  Come drive the one curvy block, just like everyone else.

 Class B Tourist Traps 
  Fort Point/Chrissy Field  very nice
  Coit Tower  the best part are the murals
  North Beach  food, yay!
  Chinatown  Dim Sum, cheap goods, chickens hanging on hooks
   The Fortune Cookie Factory  meet the guy who types up all those fortune cookies
   If you want Chinese stuff without having to elbow people out of the way, head over to Irving street in the Sunset district or Clement street in the Richmond district. Youll pay a bit more but its less crowded and has better parking.
  wiki:SF:Palace of Fine Arts  The Exploratorium is cool, the architecture is pretty, and on weekends you can play count the wedding party photo shoots.
  HaightAshbury  See hippies
  Broadway east of Columbus  Mass Nakedness
  Golden Gate Park  Its a REALLY big park.
    There are quite a few homeless people camped out in the park so its best to be vigilant when exploring trails that look to be off the beaten path.
    If you tire of the park, theres a nice beach just west of it. While its cold and gray 90% of the time, its quite nice the remaining 10% of the time. See Ocean Beach in the next section.
  The Audium  The most underground music experience in SF
  wiki:sf:Metreon  Shopping Center with the largest multiplex in San Francisco

 Where all the cool kids hang out 
  wiki:SF:Exploratorium  Hands down the coolest place in SF, probably the whole Bay Area; dont miss this.
  The Mission District
  Bars and Clubs
  Castro  The West Coast Gay Community Gay Mecca
   http://www.thecastrotheatre.com The Castro Theatre  the Castro Districts beautiful old movie palace built in 1922; theres always an interesting film festival or event happening there; the theatre is also host to the annual http://www.silentfilm.org San Francisco Silent Film Festival.
  http://shopstonestown.com/html/index3.asp Stonestown Galleria  the Mall. The only place to hang out thats west of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Peaks,_San_Francisco,_California Twin Peaks.
   If you tire of the mall experience, theres another nearby hangout: Walk down 19th Ave. to the SFSU campus and check out the http://sfsustudentcenter.com Student Center; theres usually something going on during the week.
  http://www.sfmoma.org SF Museum of Modern Art  Very good, very active museum; great place to spend a Saturday; located just off Market and short walk from Powell or Montgomery BART stations
  Ocean Beach  A beautiful, if usually freezing cold, break from city life that runs from The Cliff House restaurant to Daly City. Youll see diehard surfers in the day, bonfires at night, and the wonderful smell of the ocean at all times.

 Transportation 

 Getting there 
 By Public Transit 
By Amtrak train, purchase a ticket from Davis to Emeryville and hop on an Amtrak shuttle bus to get across the Bay Bridge.  The shuttle bus is also called the Route 99 Motorcoach Connection, if youre looking at a Capitol Corridor train schedule.  It will drop you off in a few places in downtown San Francisco.  They are (headed westbound):
      Financial Building  Hyatt
      Ferry Building Annex
      Pier 39
      Shopping Center @ 4th and Market
      Moscone Center
      Caltrain Depot
Keep in mind that Route 99 doesnt hit up each of those six stops every time  youll have to check the schedule for details.  Each of the bus stops is marked by a sign reading Amtrak bus stop so you know youre in the right place.  If you dont have a ticket, youll just need to show an ID to ride.  Depending on the time of day you travel, it will probably take 3045 minutes between Emeryville and San Francisco.

Alternatively, you can also connect to BART via Amtrak at the Richmond station where the train platforms are connected.

Take the http://www.baylinkferry.com/ Baylink Ferry from Vallejo for a scenic trip to San Francisco.

 By Car 
To get to the city by car, simply follow Interstate 80 west. There are two toll bridges on this path: the Carquinez Bridge and the Bay Bridge. The toll for the Bay Bridge varies throughout the day and over the weekend; with it being $4 before and after rush hour, $6 between 5am10am and 3pm7pm, and $5 all day Saturday and Sunday. Fare for the Carquinez Bridge is only collected on the way back towards Davis, the fare being a flat $5. To save a toll on your return trip, take Highway 101 north to Highway 37 east Vallejo to connect up with Interstate 80 eastbound. Of course, youll probably use up the same amount of money in gas, though this alternate route is quite a pleasant drive.

If traffic is heavy on Interstate 80 westbound, exit Highway 37 west in Vallejo or 101 south in Novato  it takes a little longer, but generally has less traffic on weekends. The Golden Gate Bridge toll going into SF is $6. This is a fun route to take tourists on their first trip to the city. It is a more dramatic entrance, plus you can go up into the highlands and take some killer pictures of the city and bridge. Be forewarned however: Highway 37 is one lane each direction, and can get backed up, especially if there is an event at Infineon Raceway just off Highway 37.

One can also drive as far as Martinez and connect to BART at the North Concord/Martinez station just over the Benicia Bridge; a oneway fare to SF starts at $4.60 (North Concord to Embarcadero).

 By Bike 
To get to the city on your bike, see the Bicycle Rides page.

 Getting Around 
The best ways to get around the City are bus/streetcar, http://www.sfmuni.com/cms/mms/home/home50.htm Muni, and BART, a superb public transit system by American standards. There are also a lot of taxi cabs available.
