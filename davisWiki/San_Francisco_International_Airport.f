San Francisco International Airport (a.k.a., SFO) is one of the major airports that provides service to people from Davis. While Sacramento International Airport SMF is closer to Davis than SFO, the latter offers many more direct flight destinations.

SFO employs millimeter wave advanced imaging technology, purportedly for security screening of passengers. These machines, unlike the wiki:wikipedia:Backscatter Xray backscatter xray machines used elsewhere, do not use wiki:wikipedia:ionizing radiation (a known carcinogen).

 Transportation to SFO from Davis 
Suggestions about the best and cheapest ways to get there from here (or here to there):
 Airporters 
   Davis Airporter Takes you to and from anywhere in Davis directly to the airport. You may ride with other passengers.
 Taxicabs 
Taxi Services Taxicabs are more price competitive if a larger group is booked and may be more convenient without the picking up or dropping off of other passengers.  (SFO is more friendly to taxicabs than the pretentious Sacramento International Airport.  There are no required radio tracking devices and charging for dropoffs or pickups.)
 Trains 
   BART heavy rail goes directly to SFO.  The easiest BART parking is at the El Cerrito station.
       Avoid most traffic.
       Meet entertaining people.
   BART+Amtrak Capitol Corridor is another good idea.  They share a train station station in Richmond, so transferring is a snap.
       Avoid all traffic
       No Tolls
       Some Amtraks have wireless internet.  All trains have electrical plugs for laptops.
       Bathrooms
       They sell alcohol.
       NOTE: While the Capitol Corridor is VASTLY more on time than your usual Amtrak, sometimes other trains that share the track cause delays.
       The Amtrak leg of the trip is slightly more expensive than perhaps it could be.  Remember your AAA discount.  Also theres a student advantage discount possible, too.
BerkBus Shuttle + Bart
Catch the Davis Berkeley Shuttle BerkBus Shuttle to UC Berkeley.  When you get to Berkeley, walk a block or so down/West on University Ave. Catch a left/South onto Shattuck Ave. Get on a BART train heading towards San Francisco.  Unless you can catch a ride on a train straight to SFO, plan on waiting for a transfer at the Balboa Station in SF.

20130527 17:44:22 nbsp Another option is to drive to Walnut Creek Bart(45 mins  1hr depending on traffic). Bart has a long term airport parking rate of $5/day. You pay online & display the permit in your car.

Take the yellow line Bart from Walnut Creek to SFO(inside the United Terminal), no transfers required. This trip is usually about an hour.

Walnut Creek is one of the safer & better stations on the BART line.
