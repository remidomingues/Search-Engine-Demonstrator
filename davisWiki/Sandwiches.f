20050205 19:45:56 nbsp the #2 panini from the nugget will change your life!! Users/KrisFricke

20050205 19:48:10 nbsp the food coop is a great deal for your money because you can pile on as much stuff as you want for a flat rate. this often results in delicousness. Users/ArlenAbraham

The CoOp makes great sandwiches, I used to work there and have made many of them. Quiznos is not that bad either  try the veggie with black olives and guacamole. And the Delta of Venus has a wonderful vegan sandwich which is only $3.50  Users/CristinaDeptula

The BLTCC on Dutch at Posh Bagel is the best damn sandwich.  Plus their rolls are the right size  not too large, not too small, stuffed with good ingredients.  I like the food at Delta, but it varies a bit (and I dont like the marinated onions on their sandwiches)  Users/JabberWokky

The California Aggies Adam Tanguay did a review of the sandwiches in May of 2005, however the online article appears to have been taken down.

20060306 16:57:07 nbsp Zias is the best sandwich in Davis.  Anyone who says otherwise is lying to you. Users/ZacMorris

20070319 13:47:05 nbsp i certainly agree that zia is good, and perhaps consistently the best (if you dont factor in price).  However the COHOs grilled eggplant and roasted red pepper sandwich is the best single sandwich in town for the price at $4.30 (since houng lan went out of business) Users/MattHh

20090925 22:08:41 nbsp Anyone know of a good place in Davis to find a decent Philly Cheesesteak? Hopeful, but not optimistic Ill find one, but just asking.  Thanks! Users/DrStrangeLove
  You mean with canned spray cheese? jw
  Im looking for this also. Ive had them at Redrum Burger and Burgers and Brew but they were too expensive and not good enough. The best one I remember was at Norms Pizza, too bad theyre closed. :(  Users/NickSchmalenberger

20110330 19:14:13 nbsp The BLTCC at Posh Bagel doesnt compare to the BLT at Ciocolat. Though Ciocolats BLT is somewhat dryordering additional spread on it fixes thisCiocolats BLT has much more quality and distinctness to its flavors that the Posh Bagels BLTCC does not. Users/MichaelFiglock
