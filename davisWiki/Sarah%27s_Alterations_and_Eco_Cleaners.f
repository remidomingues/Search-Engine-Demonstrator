Sarahs Alterations and Eco Cleaners is a quiet little tailoring tailor shop tucked away behind The Mustard Seed. Its a little hidden but if you walk around in the complex, youll find it. Apparently, they also offer Laundry & Drycleaning cleaning services.

Hans Tailor was previously at this location.


20110702 11:20:42 nbsp I thought Id give Sarah a try after having several good experiences with Han. Unfortunately, she was unprofessional  criticized another tailors work on  a piece that I brought in. That tailor did the work well (in my view) and at a reasonable price. I dont expect the same from this facility. Currently in search of a new Davis tailor. Users/Kdogs

A few months ago I had one dress dry clean at this store since it is quite close to my place. I did not check before I brought it back. After a while when I wanted to wear it, it had a spot which was not cleaned...Since I did not check it carefully when she handed me the dress, I did not bother arguing (obviously a mistake!!!)
Last week I brought a NEW WITH TAG $250 silk dress to have its zipper replace and this time when she handed me the dress, I took the lesson of last time and checked and found some part of the dress was torn...I talked about it and she became very defensive and kept saying You can not blame us because we did not do it; I asked whether she replaced the zipper or one of her assistant did it, but she did not answer but just repeated the same sentence...I pointed out that the dress is brand new and she became very angry and said I should not bring any clothing to her store next time....I did not want to throw myself into an unreasonable argue and so I just walked away with my broken dress and ended up posting comments in wiki.
Hope someone can learn from my experience. Users/StephanieMai

20140717 15:54:23 nbsp The laundry service at Sarahs is the best in town.  Her prices are lower and the quality is higher.  Plus, she is very nice and greets me by name.

I have tried the other cleaners and often find wrinkles in the shirts from the way they are pressed.  Ive never found that at Sarahs.   Users/RMS
