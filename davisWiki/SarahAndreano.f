So, I dont actually live in Davis anymore.

I did, however, go to college there. It was a great, challenging, growing, amazing four years, and somehow or other, I came out on the other side with a Bachelor of Science in Psychology, and minors in both English and Religious Studies.

But after graduating, I moved. To go to grad school in a new and different state. And that was that.
