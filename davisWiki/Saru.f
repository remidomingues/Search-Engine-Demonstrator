An animal lover who decides to stay in Cows cow town for a while... 0.0

Super environmentalist!!

Planning to become Vegetarian Options vegetarian soon!! I want to travel around the world and eat all the good stuff before that!!

I love Japan and I have been there for 10+ times

Currently employed at Crepe House Uni and LOVING the crepes~

Lastly, I am not Sagat (Since I saw people responding to my post and assuming that I am Sagat because we share the same IP), I pay for my crepes when I dont work so that makes me a customer as well, deshou?!~  ^^

Always looking for good food around the world so please give me recommendations!!
