Mission: To create and share, wholesome, vibrant, and profoundly nourishing food.  No cans, no concentrates, no animal products.  Original recipes only.

About:  With much sadness Sasha left her beloved home in the Bay Area to follow me, her husband, to School of Veterinary Medicine veterinary school at UC Davis. Her surroundings may have changed but Sasha still loves to make delicious, nutritious food for her friends and family. Nothing brings her more joy. Every week she makes a soup from all natural, fresh ingredients and delivers them around Yolo county. I designed this website in an attempt to support her venture.

Ordering Protocol:  Each week I will send out what the soup of the week is via email.  If you are interested (and please do not ever feel ANY pressure), then reply no later than noon on Friday.  Sunday night I will delivery deliver the soup anywhere within Yolo County.  Pay me in person or through paypal.  Enjoy the soup at your leisure, and please save and rinse the container so we can keep using it.  Referrals, requests, and constructive criticism are all highly encouraged.
