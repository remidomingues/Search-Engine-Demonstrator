20120909 00:36:44 nbsp Really nice staff when I went in. She helped me pick out products to mend my damaged hair. They have a wide selection of hair products and I was very impressed with all the OPI nail polish!  Caveat is that it is pricey but Im not sure if it is much more than you would pay for a bottle at a salon.   Users/SKbear

20130121 17:54:28 nbsp Michelle is AMAZING!  I first went to Michelle when she worked at Lucis and have followed her to Sassafras.

I am from the east coast (NY and Boston) and am definitely used to high quality haircuts.  When I first moved to Davis I always drove to SF to get my hair cut for $100 or so.  Michelle does just as nice of a job and for far less $$ and without the hassle of driving.

I have thick straight hair which I typically keep shoulderlength or shorter.  I am superpicky about my haircut because I love to be able to wash and go sometimes.  I like a more traditional haircut with layers to add some movement.  I am sure Michelle would do fabulous with other types of hair and styles too!!    Users/daviscagradstudent

20130201 01:16:47 nbsp Honestly I never liked this place as pure beauty, but they have become even worse as sassafras. I just go for nail polish so I cant comment on all the hair products and the salon, but their collection of polish has become even smaller and the customer service ten times worse. Save yourself some money and rudeness and drive to ulta if you can. Users/ArtoonCartoon

I apologize for your negative experience at our store. We do carry the entire OPI nail polish collection, but have not yet been able to expand to other lines. Over the past year our business has gone through numerous changes and I hope that you will consider coming back in again soon so that we may have the opportunity to change your opinion.
