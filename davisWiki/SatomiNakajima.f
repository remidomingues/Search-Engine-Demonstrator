SatomiNakajima:

Satomi Nakajima is a UCD Alumni as of June 2010, receiving a Bachelor of Science in the awesome (and apparently unaccredited) major of biomedical engineering.
Her advice to undergrads: Job searchings a bitch, kids, so do research/internships during your school years to network & get experience.

Satomi and her fiance Mario found their lost cat Calli through DavisWiki and its kind users last year. Lost Pets Calli. Calli gave birth to 3 healthy kittens upon her return, two of which found good homes. The remaining one, Tigger, stayed with us and turned one years old on Oct. 3, 2010. The two cats take great care of our newly adopted 2month old kitten, Kairi.
