For the first time, the city is considering selling a Greenbelts greenbelt to a private developer.

Please help by writing to your City Council members to urge them to follow existing policy, which calls for all feasible alternatives to be explored before a greenbelt is converted to another use.

Please also visit https://www.change.org/petitions/savedavisgreenbelts the online petition, and be among the first to petition the City Council to create a policy specifically governing the sale of greenbelt.

Such a policy must be in place before any greenbelt is sold. The sheer number of saveourgreenbelt petitions at change.org suggests that greenbelts need our protection. Please join us.
