About Me:

       Hey everyone! What it do? Im Michelle and its good to see that people are interested in me, or that they have nothing really to do and are just cruising around on Davis Wiki. {{{^__^}}} Well anyways, Im currently a sophomore at UC Davis majoring in Animal Biology. Hopefully that major could get me into vet school if I can manage to keep my grades up (Stupid chemistry..). Im a layedback kind of gal who enjoys having fun with friends and family. One of the best ways to do that is to play in the California Aggie Marching BandUh Cal Aggie Marching Banduh! and play rockin, kick ass tunes! Other than that I like doing the usual things of staying home and enjoying a relaxing day or going out there and play a quick game of basketball. Other than that you can check me out on Facebook and give me a message. See ya! {{{^__^}}}
