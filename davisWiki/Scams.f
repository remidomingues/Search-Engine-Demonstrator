Scams are an unfortunate part of life in Davis.  On occasion, people try to take advantage of others by tricking them out their money.  The following is a list of scams that have been reported in Davis:

20070418: The Davis Chamber of Commerce has just been informed of a phone scam directed towards local businesses.

A Chamber Member was contacted by phone this morning to support the Davis High School Volleyball Team by placing an ad on the teams volleyball poster. This Member knew the Coach of the Team and was ready to sign on until they asked for prepayment with a credit card. The Member said she wanted to contact the school first and the solicitor said theyd call back tomorrow. After calling the High School, the Member found out that there was not a poster for the High School Volleyball Team.

The Davis Police Department is actively investigating this issue. Please call them at 5307475400 if you have any information.

(Received in an email from the Chamber of Commerce)

20100502: A young lady of short stature and blonde hair is running what is most likely a street scam.  She lures people walking around downtown in with a sob story of being kicked out of her boyfriends mothers house and she needs money to get a ticket to San Diego via Amtrak.  She gave out the phone number: (707) 3012275, it is most likely a fake.
 This girl is also mentioned on the Con Artists page, and includes a photo.  It may or may not be her, but its worth looking at.



20120221: Some guy is apparently going door to door asking for people to contribute to a fundraiser to raise money for a hospital and states that he is from the UCDavis Lacrosse Team (also identified himself as Will). The person that was contacted by this guy called the UCD Lacrosse Head Coach and asked about the fundraiser, to which the coach responded that they were not running any fundraisers nor did they have any players named Will this year. You can find more information on the UCD Mens Lacrosse Team Facebook page or their http://ucdlax.com/slide/ucdavislacrossefundraisingfraud/ website. They are instructing anyone contacted by these people to ask for their information and send it over to the lacrosse team.



20100502: I ran into this young lady with my girlfriend.  I distinctly heard her say why does this street suck so much? on the phone.  She quickly hung up, gathered herself and presented her tall tale to us.  I was suspicious and pressed for more information for two minutes.  My girlfriend was about to give her money, so I told her to go get picked up by her friends (who couldnt help her get a ticket).  We told her to meet us at Amtrak in 20 minutes, giving me time to get cash for her.  Bull, she never showed.  A similar thing happened to two freinds of mine, who gave her $5 and she disappeared.

20120417 13:23:47 nbsp There are these scammers in town, they hit my rental house last year. Theyre back! They claim to be fundraising for a trip to (insert location here, last year it was Cabo... this year its Germany apparently? Who would want to go to Germany?) and want you to order magazines from them. They all seem to be tweakers of some sort, kinda hyperactive and all that I have seen have been heavy smokers by the smell. They talk about public speaking project, boys vs girls, etc. The girl from last year (there was a guy too but I didnt bother) asked to come in, talked us up. We trolled her for a bit, gave her false information and eventually a check which we cancelled immediately after. No one ever contacted us back and some research into the business name they gave us yielded several other reports of scamming on a national level. Seems that they travel town to town collecting checks, some of which are reported to never have been taken out according to some of the suckers. Others have said the payment was taken but the magazines ordered were never received. Overall its shady. Beware for the next couple days at least. Currently they are going around East Davis, well see how long they stick. Users/KBathory
