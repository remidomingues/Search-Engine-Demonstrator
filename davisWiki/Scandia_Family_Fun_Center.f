Despite the prevalence of golf and disc golf options in Davis, there is no forum for miniature golf inside city limits, or even within Yolo county county lines.  Thus the Scandia Family Fun Center is the closest miniature golf venue, with two nearequidistant locations in Sacramento and Fairfield, both about half an hour away.  Both locations offer two 18hole miniature golf courses, as well as a large Arcades arcade, laser tag, batting cages, bumper boats, gocart track, and snack bar.  The Sacramento Scandia also features the http://www.sacbee.com/static/newsroom/swf/may07/scandia/ Scandia Screamer, a 168foot tall giant rotor that reportedly spins at 65 miles an hour, while the Fairfield location has a 25foot rock wall and extreme air trampolines.

One round of minigolf costs $8 for adults at the Fairfield location, while adults can purchase an Unlimited Golf Pass for just $8.95 at the Sacramento Scandia.  Prices for other activities vary, but there are a myriad of multiattraction package deals and group rates.

From the Sacramento Scandia website: Scandia was founded in 1977 by three Scandinavian families, the Larsons, Madsens and Jensens. Sacramento was the first Scandia ever built, followed by Fairfield, Las Vegas, Victorville, and Ontario.  In the past 30 years Scandia has donated millions of dollars to local, value based organizations and its owners have been anxiously engaged in philanthropic causes such as running orphanages in Mexico and supporting Christian missionaries.

They have hosted small video game and anime conventions run by local groups.
