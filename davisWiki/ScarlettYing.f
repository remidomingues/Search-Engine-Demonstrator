Scarlett currently resides in Davis, CA at La Salle. She moved here from Los Angeles when she decided that she wasnt getting much enjoyment out of big city life anymore. Initially hoping to transfer to UC Davis from a Los Angeles college, she decided to move up to Davis a year before her transfer and is now finishing all her transfer requirements at Sacramento City College. When she transfers into UC Davis, she will be an odd combination of a Political Science and Film Studies double major. Most of her time outside of class is spent at Swirl Frozen Yogurt, her workplace. She enjoys activities such as perusing the Davis Farmers Market, making frequent trips for Nobu Hiro sushi, Yolo County Library  Davis Branch reading, and watching $4.25 Movie Tuesday movies.
