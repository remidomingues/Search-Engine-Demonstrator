If you dont know what a scenster is already. Then youre hopeless. Go shove a spike into your crimson heart and weep in the shadows of your ignorance. And then pray youll be resurrected in a Thrift Stores thrift store.

Sarcasm aside, another popular wiki:WikiPedia:Wikipedia wiki has a X great X deleted wiki:WikiPedia:Scenester definition of a scenester.  A scenester is not to be confused with a wiki:WikiPedia:Hipster hipster, which is somewhat different;  this phrase better describes individuals who refer to themselves as being http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?termdeck deck. Scenester seems to be more of a pejorative than hipster, though this all depends on your Social Structures social group. Scenesters all try to look different in the same way.  The sarcastic news source, The Onion, ran a funny http://www.theonion.com/content/node/46691 parody of these terms.

For example, if you want to criticise a friends look for being too trendy:
  (sarcastically) Those shoes are very scene of you.

Since wikipedia seems to have deleted the Scenester page (they arent scene enough), heres the definition from the web archive (GFDL licensed):
 Scenester is a term used to describe an individual who participates in the clothing styles, hair styles, and general lifestyles that revolve around certain Subculture, particulary pertaining to music. These Subcultures created are referred to as scenes. Scenesters generally are found in, but are not limited to, hardcore, Metalcore, electr0cl@sh, and Emo music. The noun scene is many times used as an adjective to describe scenesters. Scene can also refer to the underground party scene and its followers.

20050131 13:13:37 nbsp Context Im seeing it here in seems pretty insulting.  And I thought it was not an insult Users/KrisFricke

20050316 17:02:17 nbsp I have no idea what is going on.   Users/GeorgeLewis

20050418 20:26:01 nbsp Well I thought it was more of a description than an insult but then I got chewed out by a friend of a KDVS DJ and use it in a purely derogatory sense. That being said, if one admits to being scene, does that lift the derogatory connotation? Or are they merely being ironic and pandering to the nonscenester that had the ignorance to call them on it?
