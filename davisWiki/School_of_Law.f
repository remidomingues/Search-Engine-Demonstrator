The UC Davis School of Law teaches law. From its founding class in 1966 whose students were actively involved in legal, political and social debates of the late sixties to its current student body, King Hall has been actively focused on public interest issues and is today recognized for that heritage. King Hall has moved to the forefront of legal education in the United States, establishing accreditation from the American Bar Association, membership in the Association of American Law Schools, and recognition from the Order of Coif, the national honor society for lawyers. It is one of the highest ranked small public law schools in the United States and is regarded as the best law school established in the last fifty years, consistently ranked by U.S. News & World Report in the firsttier of law schools since the inception of the national rankings. The schools diverse student body sits among the top ten small public law schools in the US when it comes to diversity.

Generally, California law schools are amongst the finest in the nation and towards the top of this list are the four renowned UC System University of California law schools: the School of Law at UC Davis (King Hall), Boalt Hall School of Law at UC Berkeley, UCLA School of Law, wiki:sf:Hastings College of Law, and UC Irvine School of Law, which opened in fall of 2009. Of the five UC law schools, UC Davis is generally regarded as the third most prestigious school, closely following Berkeley and UCLA.

Despite the notoriously difficult California State Bar Exam, King Hall boasts one of the nations highest bar average passage rates over the last twenty years. In fact, it took Governor Jerry Brown (Yale) two attempts while former Governor Pete Wilson (Boalt) had to try four times! Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa (Peoples College of Law, unaccredited) of Los Angeles never managed to pass after failing four times. Areas in which King Hall excels include International Law, Environmental Law, Business Law, Intellectual Property Law, Human Rights & Social Justice Law, Public Interest Law and Immigration & Civil Rights Law.

 King Hall FAQ 

http://faqs.netesq.com/kinghall/part1.html The King Hall FAQ was last updated in 1996 and is an interesting time capsule of what life at King Hall was like during the mid 1990s.  Its author also published the thenuseful (but nowamusing) UCDavis Usenet FAQ at the same time.

 US News Rankings 

These rankings are extremely controversial. For one, their methodologies arent very strict, subject to all sorts of variations, and essentially boil down to a nonstatisticallyvalid measure of reputation rather than quality or rigor of education. However, for better or for worse, they influence perceptions of law schools among potential applicants and potential employers.  Over the last 15 years, Davis has performed fairly comparably to Hastings.

San Diego ~65, Pepperdine ~77, Santa Clara ~77, McGeorge ~90.

 Bar Exam Rate Discussion 

Despite King Halls very high overall bar pass rate, there was a dip in passage rates at one point. In 2009 it was back to 90%.  Still, it is usually among the topperforming schools in the country.  In the 1980s and early 1990s, the bar pass rate was consistently above the 90% mark, earning UC Davis a commendation of the California State Senate (which is framed in one of the hallways at King Hall).  However, for a while around 2005 the pass rate slipped to the http://calbar.ca.gov/calbar/pdfs/admissions/Statistics/JULY2005STATS.pdf mid 70s, something that Users/JaimeRaba one alumnus believes is rooted in the lowering of academic standards which culminated in the altering of the forced curve.  The old curve is discussed in the antiquated http://faqs.netesq.com/kinghall/part1.html King Hall FAQ, and because a passing examination answer was supposedly correlated closely to a passing bar examination answer, there could be some relationship.  The examination vs. bar examination difficulty correlation likely disappeared prior to the forced curved being altered, but this change, something perhaps emblematic of this shift in grade policy. Users/JaimeRaba

  The bar passage rate for King Hall graduates taking the July 2005 exam (as first time takers) was 76%.  Users/SamanthaGrant
  For July 2009, we had 89% for the California  bar exam (first time takers), 90% overall (meaning other states).  Really fantastic!  Users/TomGarberson
