  UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine was set on an accelerated inspection schedule (meaning they would have to be reevaluated sooner than normal) due to a 1998 AVMA inspection that deemed their classroom facilities too old and inadequate.  The school started work on a few new buildings with brand new stateoftheart equipment.  On March 9th, 2005 UCD School of Vet Medicine regained full accreditation after meeting the AVMA requirements set for vet schools. http://www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2005/03/09/FrontPage/VetSchool.FullyAccredited.Again1319878.shtml Aggie article
