Schoolapalooza is a fundraising event for the Davis Joint Unified School District as part of the DollaraDay Campaign, organized by the Davis Schools Foundation (DSF) together with the Davis Downtown Business Association.

April 24, 2010 was the 3rd such event,  from noon to 4:30 PM.  Activities were centered at the E Street Plaza.  In addition to musical entertainment and raffles, fiftythree Davis businesses donated a portion of their proceeds to the DSF.  Some businesses extended their special deals beyond Saturday.

Nearly $75,000 was donated during the 2010 Schoolapalooza.

Some features of the event:

  Two stages for performances, one at the E Street Plaza and another one in front of the Varsity Theatre.
  A fashion show, with junior high students modeling items from Lilys Fashion Lounge and Outdoor Davis. Both stores gave 10 percent of their Saturday proceeds to DSF.
  Jazz bands from all three junior high schools, the popular youth band Hotwire, and the Davis High School Madrigals and Advanced Treble Choir.
  Raffle tickets at $1 per ticket or 25 tickets for $20, purchased at the E Street Plaza and then placed in raffle boxes for prizes at shoppers favorite stores.  The business owners drew the winning raffle tickets after Schoolapalooza ends and contacted the winner; there was no need to be present to win.
  If you brought in a flier from Caffe Italia or Cultive Frozen Yogurt Cultivé, the restaurant would donate 100 percent of its sales from 11 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. to DSF.  If you brought in a flier from Chipotle, it would donate 50 percent of burrito proceeds.
