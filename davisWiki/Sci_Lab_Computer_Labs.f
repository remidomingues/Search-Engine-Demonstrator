The Science Laboratory Building Computer Labs (SciLab 2060 and 2020) are computer labs located on the second floor of the Sciences Laboratory Building which is across the street from the Academic Surge Surge buildings and right next to Haring Hall and the Silo bus stop. The are considered computer classrooms and may not be available for open access.  Check for availability http://clm.ucdavis.edu/rooms/available/ on the website.

Sci Lab 2060 has:
  2 black and white printers
  37 sit down PC stations
  Projector, whiteboard,  and instructor station for classes
  Class software (see http://clm.ucdavis.edu/rooms/classsw.html for current list):
   Mathcad 14, CN3D, Rasmol, GeneDoc, BSL Analysis, NanoDrop ND1000, ChimeX files for Bis102, and Deltagraph 4 (PC #120)

Sci Lab 2020 has:
  2 black and white printers
  41 sit down PC stations
  Projector, whiteboard, and instructor station for classes
  Class software (see http://clm.ucdavis.edu/rooms/classsw.html for current list):

This lab is generally less crowded than most due to it being more out of the way than places like the MU Station lab.  Most of the software for science classes can be found in these labs.

2060 is generally open access most of the time while 2020 has more classes in it.
