Scientology is an applied Religious and Spiritual Organizations religious philosophy founded by http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._Ron_Hubbard L. Ron Hubbard, the notable Science Fiction Author. The Church of Scientology is controversial. There have been allegations that Church teachings lack merit and the organization is a cults cult. However, there are sincere Scientologists who believe in their faith and are part of our community. Consult the links below to weigh the evidence and form your own opinion. The first church was formed in 1954 at Los Angeles.

It is referred to as an applied religious philosophy as no one is asked to accept anything on belief or faith. Rather one studies the writings and works out how they can apply the philosophy to their life and observe the results for themselves.

Scientology is an applied religious philosophy in the oldest traditions of religion in its recognition of the human spirit. It holds certain fundamental truths that man is an immortal spiritual being with experiences that extend well beyond one lifetime, and its goal is the attainment of one’s own understanding that he is himself a spirit.

There are presently more than 7,700 Churches, Missions, and groups in 164 countries worldwide.

In 1993 the Internal Revenue Service granted full religious exemption to the church after an extensive and thorough examination of its records confirming the Church’s religious nature, at least as far as the IRS is concerned.

The founder, L. Ron Hubbard, is a widely published author as evidenced by his recent inclusion into the Guinness Book of World Records with two awards as the most published and most translated author of all time.

There is a Scientology mission in the Court N Cedar building at 231 G Street. AJSmith works in the office across from it and has yet to see anyone there. They handed out treats and Scientology information from this location for Halloween 2008. Note that this is the same building where the Christian Science Reading Room is located. Despite the similarity in names, the two are different religions, and located in separate suites. Sacramento has a http://www.scientologysacramento.org/ branch. They may also have a branch in Woodland, as they occasionally host stress tests (their instruments measure wiki:wikipedia:galvanic skin response which may or may not correspond to stress, depending on the situation)  outside Walmart.

They appear to be opening a new branch in downtown Sacramento at the corner of 6th and J.  There was some sort of grand opening event on the afternoon of January 27, 2012.

Scientologists had a rather large tent set up in the quad on 102005.  Scientologists had a Dianetics table at the Farmers Market on 10/01/05 with what looked like modified 1980sera battery testers, wiki:WikiPedia:Emeter used allegedly to read your emotional level.  The device registers the subjects galvanic skin response, similar to many lie detectors. They have also appeared at the Whole Earth Festival with emeters and discussed using niacin / detoxifying drinks to cleanse the body.

There are also those who are critical of Scientology as well, due to its wiki:wikipedia:Scientology_controversies#.22Attack_the_Attacker.22_policy shady practices, wiki:wikipedia:Scientology_controversies#Mistreatment_of_members mistreatment of members, and wiki:wikipedia:Operation_Snow_White infiltration of the U.S. government in order to destroy records that portray the Church in a bad light.

20080209 01:00:56 nbsp I would like to point visitors to the talk page. Users/JakeLosh

20080209 03:44:45 nbsp this page has little to do about Davis, although I did see a scientology tent at the whole earth festival, they were doing emeter tests Users/StevenDaubert

20080210 18:57:10 nbsp I like the current page setup best. Gives a few words about scientology, acknowledges controversy  around it, but most importantly, gives local relevance. Users/MattBlair

20080210 20:18:32 nbsp In the 1970s Scientologists were very active in Davis; one member told me the Davis group was one of the largest in the state. If you were studying on the quad or in the MU, you were very likely to be proselytized by a Scientologist, a member of Bill Brights Campus Crusade for Christ, or a passing group from the Children of God. The Scientologists rented a house on 1st or 2nd Street where they had meetings and conducted their audit sessions.  Users/DonShor

20080210 20:40:37 nbsp It is my understanding that Scientologists used to live at the old http://daviswiki.org/Sigma_Chi?actionFiles&doview&targetbldg_sigChi.jpg Sigma Chi house back in the 70s. Users/RobRoy
  You are correct RobRoy, Ive seen the huge universe mural in what used to be the meeting room  Users/StevenDaubert
         The Sigma Chis moved into the house near Cuarto, their were doors with rectangular holes at the bottom and locks that could not be opened from the inside of the room Users/JimSchwab
            This should be the sig ep house now  Users/StevenDaubert
                  It is now the Sigma Nu house.  Ive heard a few stories (Im not sure if theyre true or not) about some of the creepy things the scientologists left behind or did to the house during their stay.  Users/EvelynMerit


20080806 09:18:21 nbsp There is actually a scientology mission in davis. 231 G Street, Suite 25.  I work in the office across from it and have yet to see anyone there. Users/AJSmith
    They were there handing out treats and Scientology info for Halloween 2008. Note that this is in the same building as the Christian Science Reading Room, but upstairs and on the opposite side. JessicaLuedtke

20081005 22:13:45 nbsp Early last year Anon was making an effort to promote Project Chanology by putting up posters in Wellman (and perhaps other places).  I was a little disappointed to see it slack off so quickly.  Users/AndrewHarrison

20100616 10:50:17 nbsp I was sorry to see that Scientology is back in Davis. Did you know that a terrible being named Xenu took a bunch of people and froze them in propylene glycol, put them in bombers or spaceships (I forget which) and launched them into volcanos and that those little guys are now stuck all over your body and are the cause of all your physical and mental ills? Thats what you find out on the level called OT 3. Did you know that you are going to get pneumonia because you have seen what I just wrote? I was in Scn for 13 years (embarrassed to say) so I know. It costs thousands of dollars to find out this stuff. Many thousands. Its a bad, crazy cult. Stay away from it. Users/KarenKane
