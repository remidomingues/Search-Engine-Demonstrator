Ralph Nuno, aka the Scooter Cop (not to be confused with Bike Cops) is a very elusive figure.  He is a UC Davis Police Department police officer who is seen riding around on what might appear to be a larger version of the generic kick scooter, much like the kind that children play with. Its called http://www.digglerpatrol.com/ the diggler. It has 4 motorcycle batteries and can hit a max speed of about 32 mph.  You can sometimes see the cops playing with it around the UCD police/fire building and the West Entry Parking Structure Construction WEPS.  The Scooter Cop has been seen at the Memorial Union yelling at students to walk their bikes and at Aggie Stadium during Home Football Games football games.

With that minimum usage, it seems to some like a trivial usage of funds for the UCDPD.  While the Segway vehicles that various police departments use for similar events and purposes cost several thousand dollars more and dont have the speed burst, they add a lot of height, maneuverability and greatly expand the officers view.  Although it might have seemed better for the UCDPD to invest in a bicycle fitted with a stronger electrical motor, this scooter still does offer some height, probably didnt cost over a thousand, and gives the officer more freedom of movement (could jump off the scooter and run easier than one can from a bicycle). And come on, its neat!


20090810 00:14:43 nbsp It is actually an electric scooter that can get up to 35 MPH for short periods. You can sometimes see the cops playing with it around the UCD police/fire building and the WEPS. Why UCDPD bought it I dont know... It seems like a waste of money to me.  Users/ARWENNHOLD

20090810 09:28:06 nbsp Are you sure its 35mph, and not maybe 25mph?  Even that would surprise me, electric based tends to be very weak.  Vespastyle riding scooters in the 50cc gaspowered class cant top 35/40mph really, and electric versions cant top 20/25.   To think of a kick scooter, Im guessing a GoPed style, I really dont think that thing can get even close to 35mph.  And that is pretty fast, a lowslung long GoPed style scooter at that speed is pretty risky/unsafe.   Id bet it has a top speed of 20 to 25mph, maybe normally cruises around at 10 to 15.  Is it custommodified somehow? Or actually gaspowered?  Users/EdWins ES
    This comment is pretty much null after JA posted a picture.  It wasnt the sort of kick scooter I had assumed itd be. However, Ill stand by saying that even 32mph can be pretty risky for this thing, and that he likely tends to cruise around 20/25. users/edwins ES

20090810 19:46:21 nbsp Im just going off what I saw and the cop said. He could have just been trying to show off to the FD. It is electric and it does go pretty quick though.  Users/ARWENNHOLD

20090819 13:17:19 nbsp This is a great idea.  I like anything that gets the police out of their cars and into the community. Users/Graham.Freeman

20111122 21:22:11 nbsp This officer (Ralph Nuno) used to work for Oakland Police Department. Heres a little bit more about him:

After an investigation, the Department suspended Nuno for ten days for sexual harassment. Nuno appealed through the legal defense fund of the Peace Officers Research Association of California to an arbitrator.

The arbitrator reversed the suspension. The arbitrator concluded that not just Nuno, but a significant number of employees, engaged in the sort of sexual banter which formed the basis for one of the complaints against Nuno. The arbitrator held that since the City permitted such an atmosphere to exist, it had not placed employees on adequate notice that such conduct could result in discipline.

So he was suspended for sexual harassment, but the conviction was overturned because, well, OPD is filled with a bunch of cops who sexually harass women. So I would think twice when I look at that picture with the girl on his scooter. ftp Users/MK47
