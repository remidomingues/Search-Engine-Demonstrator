Scooter Man is none other than Users/DanielQuincy Daniel Quincy, an all levels Tai Chi (TaiChi Chuan (Taijiquan, Tai Chi Chuan)) instructor at the ASUCD Experimental College (EC), and in the Spring & Fall Quarters of 2005 also at the ARC (through their ARC Martial Arts Program).  He is also one of the coaches for The TAI CHI Club at UC Davis, and is the founder of The Willing Way of The Heart School of Tàijí quán (太極拳) & Qìgōng (氣功), GōngFu (功夫).

He is an older fellow, so he wears a helmet and a reflective vest when he rides his Oxygen King scooter. As for the bags hanging off his scooter, he likes to keep up with current events and holistic health news. Scooter man always has a huge smile on his face. He must be a happy man.

His EC classes are taught indoors in Winter, but in Spring, Summer and Fall some of his outdoor EC classes are taught on the East Lawn of the MU Quad on the UC Davis campus, or sometimes at the Central Park oak early in the morning (Wednesdays).

Next to being with his daughter, ILARIA, ...  Scooter Man is happiest when he is playing with the arms (... as Ilaria used to say when she was a toddler!),   that is, ...  playing TaiChi Chuan (Taijiquan, Tai Chi Chuan) Tui Shou (Tuishou, Tui Shou) or Join/ Push Hands and San Shou Sparring/Free Hands.   He does that a lot with the Tai Chi Club at UC Davis.

20051118 00:11:50 nbsp Ive talked with him several times. He is very friendly and smart, and knows a lot of random facts and trivia. Users/ThuHo

20051119 23:32:25 nbsp Older fellow sounds mildly offensive, it implies that hes different than us. Why not just call him Daniel Quincy instead of Scooter Man this sounds more respectful. Users/SteveDavison

20060328 16:13:04 nbsp Ah, but I AM getting older!   Raising a daughter for the past ten years (starting at 49) has been no joke, though the very best action I have done in my life (but good thing I restore myself practicing the TaiChi Chuan (Taijiquan) solo Form), ...  and, ...  when I found out I was Scooter Man on the DavisWiki, well it made my Year!   Thank you for your mindful concern, Steve.   I love you all. Users/DanielQuincy
