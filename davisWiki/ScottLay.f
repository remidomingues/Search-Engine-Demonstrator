Raised behind the http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362359/ Orange Curtain, Ive been a Davis resident since August 1994, and now live on D Street in Old North Davis Neighborhood Association Old North Davis with my wife Kara Ueda.  During and after law school, I lived in South Davis and in undergrad, I lived at Greystone.

Image(scottlay.jpg, 180, thumbnail)  I received a J.D. from King Hall in 2000 and a B.A. in Political SciencePublic Service from UC Davis in 1997.  For those that were around, I walked in 1996, and took a class and finally filled out my paperwork for my degree in 1997, about five minutes before the 1L barbecue at King Hall.  If youve been around Davis long enough, you might remember my illfated and illogical campaign for city council as a student in 1996. My consolation prize was law school, and Ive been happy with that series of events ever since.

Im now the President/CEO of the http://www.ccleague.org Community College League of California, which is the nonprofit association representing Californias 72 community college districts.  I have a wonderful staff that does great work that makes me look good, in midtown Sacramento.  I coauthored Proposition 92, the Community College Initiative on the February 2008 ballot, which died amidst budgetary angst.  I love Davis, although spend about 1/3 of the time in other parts of California, in which there are 112 community colleges.

I also dabble in technology and politics with my http://www.electiontrack.com ElectionTrack and http://www.aroundthecapitol.com aroundthecapitol.com websites.  If Im working in Davis, I can often be found at Cloud Forest Cafe, although my law school days were spent at Mishkas Cafe.  I cofounded and coauthored http://www.capitolbasement.com The Roundup for 3 years, but opted for a few extra minutes each morning and ended my participation in 2009.

When I am in Davis (about 50% of the time), I can be found almost daily (or, more likely, each evening) at the Davis Food Coop.  If you want to catch me in the morning, youll probably be lucky between 5:30 and 6:30 at the Davis Athletic Club, if I am in town.

As Old North Davis Neighborhood Association Old North Davis is not known for its sun, I maintain a plot at the Davis Community Garden.  Currently, I have tomatoes, peppers, beans and basil planted.

My favorite Davis restaurants include Tucos Wine Market and Cafe, Pho Bac Hoa Viet, Cafe Bernardo, Zen Toro, Thai Bistro and Ketmoree. Mustard Seed, while it has outstanding food, frustrates me with a codependent relationship (read comments on that page).  My old reliable Chinese place has been Silver Dragon, although the waistline doesnt allow for it as much these days.

Ive guess Ive become a Townies townie, but I couldnt have found a better place.  Whenever I get frustrated with town politics or any of the Town Characters, put me on a flight to Orange County and Ill remember how much I like it up here.


20100720 07:30:53 nbsp Hey Scott, I just noticed your complaint about Cafe Bernardo Bernardos substitution policy.  Theres nothing on that page about it, though.  Would you be willing to add some info there? Users/TomGarberson

20100720 07:32:09 nbsp Hey Tom...will do, although I havent tried it recently. Users/ScottLay

20100720 07:46:01 nbsp Thanks! Users/TomGarberson

20100721 19:35:24 nbsp Good King Hall news always makes me happy :)  I havent checked out her jurisprudence yet, but its still exciting. Users/TomGarberson

20100724 09:02:01 nbsp Oh, maybe he did graduate  Im not sure.  I think its notable for Davis when any student runs  and since the wiki is about Davis... So yeah, lets list Krovosa, too.  Its nice when our own stick around and do civic work.   Users/CovertProfessor
 Sorry, I just read the part that said that you ran.  I guess that was before my time.  List yourself too, then.  :)  We could even have a subsection if there are enough of you.  cp
  Well, so what do you think of the separate section idea?  That way the main list wouldnt get diluted.  Something like Alumni who have served or run for City Council.  If there are so many of you, then that is notable and interesting to me!  A good tidbit for the wiki to note and keep track of.  cp

20100724 11:58:56 nbsp That would be great!  Steal away! Users/CovertProfessor

20100724 17:39:01 nbsp Oh cool!  Well, nice to meet you... retroactively. Users/TomGarberson

20100821 19:26:33 nbsp My bad... I was hoping someone would verify for that for me, thanks. But when I was there a couple weeks ago there were no unsecured networks so thats why I thought they got rid of it. Users/jsogul

20110418 12:58:14 nbsp The squat rack at the Davis Athletic Club is the highest Ive ever seen. Im six feet tall and I cant go ATG on that. Users/hankim
 Yup...I always have to step out beyond the rack to go ATG, although some of the research now says that youre better stopping at 90 degrees.  Users/ScottLay
    Theres so much research out there when it comes to fitness that is complete bull so I tend to take it all with a grain of salt and go with what is normally accepted in the bodybuilding community. Users/hankim

20110809 20:06:03 nbsp I know exactly who you are taking about.  Users/NikhilDahal

20110809 20:08:10 nbsp We were concerned since she would stay literally from 11am1:30am at KetMoRee on certain days.
Management contacted police, police came and let her got about am hour later. Users/NikhilDahal

20111002 12:04:07 nbsp Aka was a more official name so with quotation marks may be a better unoffical name. Users/BruceHansen

20120828 19:30:22 nbsp Yep and done. I didnt say it was perfect, just that between the two I liked the one that was more aggressive in presenting the topic.  Youre right in that it was biased a bit in a direction that didnt seem borne out by the general public perception.  Thats also why I noted that most people (judging the comments) seem to think it is worth the price.  Adding more information rounds out the entry, adding community perspective.  It is a bit pricey for some, and noting that isnt bad (just as its not bad to note great deals).  I added some of your edits and shuffled stuff around a bit to add some priority to the info.  If theres anything I missed thats critical, feel free to add it.  Im not at all one of those people who feels my version good! your version bad!.  There can be a pleasant, friendly give and take to find a common ground... and often a bit of communication helps (for instance, I missed that your factual corrections had been wiped out). Users/JabberWokky

20130722 12:55:31 nbsp I always thought that it would be nice if there was an easier way to see the contributions made by a user when they reviewed a business or something, because lets face it, most people wont think to look at the user info to see if its just some ad hoc account to attack something. This would also let things be some kind of meritocracy on the Wiki. Users/hankim

20131013 14:26:04 nbsp discoveries owed so much money it wasnt even funny, and they shifted focus Users/StevenDaubert
