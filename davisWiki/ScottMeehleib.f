Thanks again for all the great history updates, and good to see you back on the wiki.  I am curious  what exactly does it mean to be a prochoice city, do you know?   Users/CovertProfessor

Welcome back!  Howre things? Users/TomGarberson

Thats really fantastic to hear, Scott! tg

Yeah, it is weird!  A nice little tidbit, actually, perfect for the wiki!  And I too am very glad to hear that you are feeling better overall these days.  As for Ruth and Sue, I seem to remember that Sue was challenging Ruth  if I recall correctly, she called Ruth a liar.  I also seem to recall that there was pretty good evidence that Ruth was, in fact, lying.  But many people somehow thought it was bad for Sue to call her a liar nonetheless.  cp

Selfproclaimed inconvenience is greatly exaggerated amused me. jw

I got Dobey as in the creature from harry potter, I get Dough Bey from Asian people, when I was younger I got Dogbert (not really an insult he is a cool character) etc etc

the thing that really grinds my gears is honestly Stephan (when its Stephen) but Im pretty sure that is touched upon in my blurb

Daubert



I was in traffic once and I saw him set up infront of aggie Daubert

Thanks. I really appreciate your point of view as well.  Users/MaxLucas


I havent put on the Wiki about meeting Clint Eastwood  in Davis. Users/BruceHansen
    I remember when Clint Eastwood would visit Dr. Donald Kincade, who was his long time friend and dentist.  The neighborhood kids would hand around their house hoping to catch a glimpse. Users/SueHjerpe


Check.  Albeit briefly. bh

 hows it going! Daubert

20110809 19:05:31 nbsp Well if you look at the first comment I deleted, it is completely baseless criminal accusation, even TomGarberson deleted a comment on PizzaGuys just a few hours ago about a baseless criminal accusation.

The second comment, is similar to another comment that is of same nature that is already on identity/abuse page.

I am happy you asked because I tried my best to explain on the comment about change but it wouldnt let me put a full explanation.  Users/NikhilDahal
 Im pretty sure neither of those comments were criminal accusations. Megan

go edit focus your energy elsewhere on the wiki and be productive you stick in the mud Users/StevenDaubert

20110812 19:27:59 nbsp Scott, I mean this in the nicest way... it might be time to take a wiki break if you call someone a literalist bitch because they correct an edit about whether someone was a mayor.   Users/CovertProfessor

20110812 19:35:24 nbsp Come on, Scott... I know youre angry, but this wont help. Users/CovertProfessor

20110812 19:41:27 nbsp I wouldnt say youre the lone voice in this.  Some agree with you, some (like me) are a bit on the fence, and some disagree.  I dont think anyone has proposed anything that we can all live with, so were in a bit of a limbo at the moment.  But that doesnt mean that you arent being heard or that its not worth your time to make your case. Users/CovertProfessor

20110812 19:47:09 nbsp Sounds like a good idea.  :) Users/CovertProfessor

20110814 20:13:25 nbsp Sucks that refocusing the yellow electric trike page didnt fly. Ive seen the guy around too, and I had really reflected on my view of him. At first I kind of thought whats with that guy? like others describe and eventually it seemed self explanatory that he is no more remarkable than other electric wheel chair users, and his vehicle is really the remarkable thing. If some wiki editor knows him well enough to say how the vehicle reflects his character, then we can write that about him, otherwise without even knowing his name... I dont think its about being PC either. PC is just a phrase for what people think others think they should do when they dont really understand the reason, so I can see why people would say that in this case. Maybe I should explain better or something so its not just PC? Users/NickSchmalenberger

20110815 00:47:10 nbsp Yeah, I think Im usually much more of an inclusionist here than others. With these sorts of pages though we should be careful. If this were a traditional message board even, old threads would be less prominent and its easier to gossip and then feel like maybe we shouldnt have gossiped about that without any further action. The wiki can really uphold gossip though and help some wacky or rude perception become conventional wisdom. A lot of people may think something (my perception is these are carpet bagging college students of power and privilege, thats probably wrong too) (lots of people probably find a cartoon interpretation of diversity convenient) wrong like that Officer Waltz is a midget and the wiki encouraged that for quite a while. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20110815 00:49:57 nbsp Also alot of the things Ive read about google lately, and the book Woman on the Edge of Time, have emphasized to me how important it is to refer to people as they like. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20110815 01:57:10 nbsp Hmm, rereading my comment, if I use words like privilege and diversity it sounds like PC claptrap. So really I think each situation must be considered separately and empathy may or may not be possible, but hopefully. Respect without empathy I think is what leads to the feeling of PC, and most people probably cannot easily empathize with many situations (I know its hard for me). I think considering the specifics though instead of general PC guidelines is important. Or something, blah, I still feel like Im being too anal about this. I guess I just happen to have some empathy for some of these situations that others dont I guess, Im not sure how else to explain anymore. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20110815 02:14:54 nbsp Also, while I have empathy for the situation because I think Ive felt like both sides in these or similar situations, I cant say I actually have empathy for those individuals whose feelings I dont actually know. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20110819 21:01:20 nbsp Dont worry about it.  As I said to CP at the time (because they were editing at the same time), I went sarcastic when I was upset, which is never a good thing.  The trigger was you saying how absolutely terrible certain things were  in front of the people who wrote them.  Virtually nobody wants to do the wrong thing here, and I know for certain that those entries have been given careful consideration over the years.  I do certainly apologize for the sarcastic and vitriolic edit. You didnt deserve it, because you are also one of the people trying to do the right thing.  I reverted that edit because I realized it was far too harsh as soon as I read it back.  My sincere apologies. Users/JabberWokky

20110903 23:42:47 nbsp Bruce most certainly is Bruce.  A fine fellow indeed.  Thanks for politely pointing out what I missed in the mess.  Im still curious as to what Wes heard that prompted this. Users/JabberWokky

20110919 16:12:49 nbsp Ive got a foam Blinky the dairy cow that I somehow acquired from some student housing authority figure when I was living in Tercero. Is that good enough for you? Users/WilliamLewis

20110920 18:17:04 nbsp Thanks.  Its easy to be upbeat in this project: for all the grief and annoyance, the vast majority of stuff actually goes along pretty smoothly.  Its easy to only see the times when things go pear shaped as the typical wiki, but there are lots of people contributing their views about Davis quietly and consistently all day and all night.   To me, thats the typical wiki.  Even when people do argue, its usually based on their passion to make sure the best thing happens: they just differ on how to do that.  Well, that and the occasional Davis dispute spilling into the wiki (,,pet grooming, ahem,,), which is a good sign that the wiki is integrated into the community. Users/JabberWokky

20110920 18:26:21 nbsp As an example, Lambda Omicron Xi is quietly putting up a photo of their 2011 formal.  Thats a win for documenting part of Davis in 2011.  Meanwhile, it looks like they got a new chef at Atria Covell Gardens who is improving the food for the senior citizens there, and The Trees Apartments has a manager communicating with their tenants.  Forget the fluff at Real Computers entry... thats the real wiki current.  Even the cab collision story and the various versions going around are healthy, as they are real aspects of Davis.  Emotionally charged, but they are the kind of things that happen in the community that the wiki should record. Users/JabberWokky

20110921 15:26:32 nbsp Actually, most Americans dont care about the constitution, as evidenced by their acquiescence to the modern, imperial federal government. Nearly everything the federal government does these days is illegal under the constitution. Sure, there is a century or two of rationalization for disobeying the actual text of the constitution in the form of case law to allow people to claim to support the constitution, but that doesnt change the fact that nearly everyone has contempt for the text itself.

Also, I think many people wish the 2nd amendment wasnt in the bill of rights. Users/WilliamLewis

20110921 15:56:58 nbsp Fair enough. ) Users/WilliamLewis

You also show a very strong compassion and concern for others, which I really respect. Users/CovertProfessor

20111003 19:42:06 nbsp Thats the point I suppose. I know Bruce is a decent guy, but I also know he can be gullible and allows people to take advantage of him and his generosity. It has happened time and time again with several of his drivers. In any case, see my most recent comment on the Friendly Cab/Talk page for further info. I am bowing out of the conversation.

Give beer to those who are perishing, wine to those who are in anguish; let them drink and forget their poverty and remember their misery no more. Proverbs 31:67

You have heard the law that says, Love your neighbor and hate your enemy. But I say, love your enemies! Pray for those who persecute you! In that way, you will be acting as true children of your Father in heaven. For he gives his sunlight to both the evil and the good, and he sends rain on the just and the unjust alike. If you love only those who love you, what reward is there for that? Even corrupt tax collectors do that much. If you are kind only to your friends, how are you different from anyone else? Even pagans do that! But you are to be perfect, even as your Father in heaven is perfect. Matthew 5:4348

20111101 16:59:46 nbsp Actually for a lot of the things the coop is the cheapest place in town.  Especially if you utilize the bulk food section for things like rice, herbs, beans, dried fruits etc.  What would normally cost me 3 bucks a bottle for paprika I can get for 60 cents from the bulk section.   Users/OliviaY

20111102 11:32:42 nbsp While I love the Coop (weve had people after we moved away from Davis comment on our Coop shopping bags), Pedrick has a bunch of bulk items and fresh fruit as well.  Again, not saying that you shouldnt go to the Coop, just giving a nod to another option.  Users/JabberWokky

20111102 18:31:15 nbsp No worries.  It takes some research and learning to figure out how to make the most of the coop.  Some things are going to be more expensive no matter what (like meats, but they are primarily local and free range which I love) but other things are super cheap.  There is a great variety of sprouted tofu that is cheap which I love and there is a clearance bin in the freezer section for meat.  I often get racks of baby back pork ribs for 50% off simply by checking this spot every time Im in the store.  Strauss Creamery has nonhomogenized milk (thick layer of cream on top of the whole milk mmm) from what I believe are free range cows.  The milk seems expensive the first time you check out but thats due to a 1.50 bottle deposit...they recycle glass bottles for the milk so when you bring the empty bottle back you get $1.50 credit on your checkout.  Plus the coupons they send out every quarter can be used on products even when they are on sale.  So today I got organic frozen corn that was already marked down a dollar for another 70 cents off.  Thats how you make the most of it.  It takes a little effort, but if you have the time it can be a really fun experience.  Produce is always expensive when its organic but I appreciate that there is more range in their produce department than any where else in town other than the farmers market.

Im a little coop crazy though and grocery shopping for me is like a religious experience because of how much I love cooking and food science.  So take everything I say with a pinch of pink Himalayan sea salt or something. Users/OliviaY

20111106 12:25:49 nbsp Utterly incorrect.  There actually was no ban, per se.  There was just a lack of licenses being given to produce or import.  You need a license to produce or import liquor, and none was given for a long time.  That resulted in a de facto ban, of course, but the difference is important to note.  Thujone never appeared in any significant quantities in period absinthe, and modern absinthe contains about the same amount. Wormwood has been used quite happily, with thujone, in a large amount of foodstuffs for the past century.  Theres a large cult around absinthe, with many misconceptions aimed at making it appear sexy, dangerous and exclusive. It turns out to just be a (very high proof!) herbal liquor that got a bad name awhile back. Users/JabberWokky
   Actually, looking it up, modern absinthe contains more thujone on average than original absinthe.  Im betting thats to market to the more is better and Im more sexy and dangerous if I drink this one modern mentality in their customer base. jw

20111106 12:37:53 nbsp Check the much more cited (and less prone to editing by absinthe groupies) wiki:wikipedia:Thujone article: skip to Thujone in absinthe.  Thats what I just read to add my follow up comment.  Much of what I wrote from earlier is from newspaper articles, a couple NPR interviews and a friend who operates a distillery in the Virgin Islands.  Theres a great, in depth article  probably in the New York Times  when the second US license was issued.  Sarah just walked in with lunch, however, so Ill be AFK for a bit. Users/JabberWokky

20111106 13:02:57 nbsp Well, again from the same article, A 2005 study recreated three 1899 highwormwood recipes and tested with GCMS, and found that the highest contained 4.3 mg/L thujone.  A liter of water is one kilogram, alcohol is similar in weight, thus the 10 mg/kg limit is very roughly two and a half times above the original early 20th century absinthe. However... the link that youre citing is from 2007 and no longer exists.  I.e., its preban information.   Users/JabberWokky
  Sarah did a glance over and thinks the limit youre talking about would work out to 7.89 mg/L  still over twice as high as the highest found in that study.  Its a quick guess, but shes a chemist, so her quick guess is probably better to go with than my rough approximation.    jw

20111106 14:01:31 nbsp Take a look at the sentence in between. Users/JabberWokky

20111106 20:11:29 nbsp Yep, except that I loathe licorice, so Ive merely tried it a few times.  I do generally like herbal liquors.  Theres an eastern European wormwood infused almond liquor that I find much more palatable.  Of course, thats even worse if youre intent upon saving people from choice, as it uses bitter almonds which contain cyanide.  Ive also had wormwood beer from a brewer in the SCA.  And parts per million is mg/kg (milli is thousandth, kilo is thousand, and 1,000,000 is a million  a thousand thousands), so it is saying the same thing, only using big terms.  Theres not much thujone in wormwood anyway, and as it in particular doesnt really add anything except a this was forbidden thrill, its a bit like seeking out bananas that are really radioactive.  Sure, all bananas are radioactive, but thats never really been the point of eating them.  Its the bitter herbal flavor of the wormwood that was cause for the original use, and wormwood was only demonized by somebody who was out to ban alcohol, blaming it for all of mankinds problems.  If he could have found something in Juniper berries and started a moral panic with them, wed have banned gin instead.  That doesnt mean youd be out seeking gin with really high levels of this minor irritating component that happened to be in the herbal extraction; youd merely be looking for good tasting gin with real Juniper. Users/JabberWokky

20111107 18:48:30 nbsp Haha yeah... http://daviswiki.org/Tragic_Events/Talk?actiondiff&version223&version122 that is pretty much why I started the talk page rather than just trying to make changes. Users/TomGarberson

20111109 06:38:50 nbsp HahHah! It will sound weird to say, but Chinese really isnt as difficult as people think.

20111205 11:58:05 nbsp I dont want to get into a metadiscussion about the Businesses page on the Talk page (Businesses/Talk/Talk ?), so I thought Id respond here.  I was a bit surprised when NB started turning the Businesses page into a Yellow Pages directory, given that a number of people had expressed reservations concerning the idea and given that there was no clear consensus.  I think under those circumstances, it should not be surprising when a number of those same people come back and say, hey, we still dont like this idea.  Or am I missing something?

20120119 12:36:52 nbsp That is a very unique view of AA.  I believe it is very disingenuous, deceptive and will mislead many people. Users/JabberWokky
 I believe that the spirituality info is accurate and is a pretty commonly held opinion about A.A..  There should be more info about A.A. other than what might here be considered the spirituality slant or intro. Users/BruceHansen
  That is my problem with it.  Reading that, its a spiritual group about submission to a higher power.  Great.  So, its basically Islam? jw

20120120 13:48:58 nbsp I said disingenuous because of bias. I dont think it is malicious bias (and I do apologize if the word disingenuous implied that), but your focus is on one single aspect and that wound up overshadowing the recovery aspect... which is thus misleading.  Personally, I also dont like the term splinter sects, and would say that there are meetings that vary from the norm to cater to the primary goal of active recovery, as supported in the fourth tradition.  Stating it like that would also probably be inaccurate, however, and so Id just go with the fact that meetings can vary in their approaches to fellowship and recovery. Personally, Im a little uncomfortable with this on the wiki because of the eleventh tradition.  But thats just me.  I would rather it be a simple declarative statement that it exists in Davis, meetings vary, and here is where to go. Users/JabberWokky

20120120 14:37:53 nbsp Yknow, Ill make it explicit: I sincerely apologize if you took my words to mean any sort of willful bad editing.

I completely believe you were editing in good faith, and I am sorry if I implied otherwise. Users/JabberWokky

20120126 00:02:55 nbsp I prefer not to dump too much crap on a new editor, and Im afraid shes getting some spillover from this ongoing thing with Bruce.  To be clear, I think that page is headed in a great direction.  There have been several great additions tonight, and I think its going to be really cool as more and more gets added.

My initial concern was twofold.  First, it looked like spam in its initial form.  Multiple links to out of town sales websites.  As she developed it more, it became clear that wasnt the case.  Second, Im concerned about any page that creates a precedent for bad pages.  Bruce has eaten up a HUGE amount of editor time creating messes that need to be cleaned up, then objecting when people clean them up.  He often points to other mess pages as support for new ones.

In short, I want to be welcoming and encourage new content without encouraging bad content (or pages with a lack of content).  I dont know whether Im doing a good job of striking that balance, but thats my hope. Users/TomGarberson

20120202 21:17:42 nbsp When I was at the Davis Beer Shoppe, I noticed some people bringing in peanuts or light snacks from outside to their table.

I dont disagree with your assertion, but a private webbug to measure and track web traffic is quite a different thing than wiki tools.

20120211 17:58:11 nbsp Thanks again for the info about the red bean buns at Kims.  I tracked them down and nuked them in the microwave.  Theyre huge!  Warning: it doesnt take too much to overheat them.  1 min is way too much, 45 secs still probably too much. (Then again, I have a really powerful microwave, so ymmv). I thought they were quite good, but a bit too much dough for me, though my partner disagreed and liked the amount of dough.

20120307 13:18:09 nbsp The ABC is often wrong. Remember the whole KetMoRee thing? A wikiite was told that her military ID wasnt valid for verification of age purposes. This is because the ABC told them all military IDs no longer met the legal requirements in California, not understanding there was a difference between the wiki:wikipedia:United States Uniformed Services Privilege and Identification Card (which met the requirements at the time) and the wiki:wikipedia:Common Access Card (a newer ID which didnt). I wrote to the ABC and they were ignorant of the fact that there are different types of military IDs out there.

20120501 14:24:56 nbsp Im glad to hear about the good treatment at de Veres.  I have never understood how or why any business wouldnt work to be accommodating to the needs of every reasonable customer.  You built out the entire freaking place and pay an enormous amount to staff to get people in and using your service.  A little extra effort for individual needs doesnt seem like a big deal in addition to all the rest.  It doesnt even have to be long term  even short term issues like a leg in a cast requires a little bit of courtesy and everything is fine. Users/JabberWokky
  Agreed.  Maybe we need a page for places that are accommodating and places that are not.  I foolishly assumed that all places in Davis would follow the ADA... rather disturbing to hear that that is not the case.   Users/CovertProfessor

20120501 15:34:45 nbsp Yes, that seems like the right way to proceed  start with places that are accommodating or not in a loose sense, only later perhaps try to tackle actual ADA compliance (which is more complicated, because then wed be in the realm of law and things start to get sticky).  How about simply calling the page Accessibility?  That way, it could cover more broadly ways in which businesses are accommodating (or not) to a variety of disabilities, not just wheelchairs?

20120514 07:11:08 nbsp Hi Scott, Im disappointed that you would characterize the actions of longterm and dedicated Davis citizens as buying and selling democracy. That is unfounded and harmful to an honest civic discussion about our local government. When I have some time, I will come back on and try to work with you to present a fair presentation of the Davis ChamberPACs activities. As you and Don Shor, and CP have presented it... its all a big conspiracy. The unfortunate fact is that we have done more that any campaign (individual or group) to publicly and transparently share our motivations, goals and financial means. I guess no good deed goes unpunished.

For starts, lets go with something simple. The ChamberPAC should have its on page. It is a separate entity that is not controlled by the Chambers Board of Directors and it is independently funded.

Secondly, why are their simplistic descriptions of the people who serve on the ChamberPACs board? Because it insinuates that the efforts are only about peripheral growth or some sort of good ol boys club. Well, that is a false chararcterization. This election and these efforts have almost nothing to do with peripheral growth... it is all about economic development policies, job growth, and respectful, collaborative and solutionoriented elected officials. There are two alternatives to clean up this wash job: either list a full range of the Board Members activities OR list none. Mine could read Kemble Pope (Chamber Executive Director, Former Chair of the City of Davis Open Space & Habitat Commission, Chair of the City of Davis Climate Action Team, Rotary Member, Campaign Consultant: Rochelle Swanson & Stephen Souza for Davis City Council, Founding Member of Designing a Sustainable and Innovative Davis Economy (DSIDE)

Lastly, why would you remove the ChamberPACs motivation for endorsing the three candidates but leave spurious remarks from an outside source... where is the context?? where is the fairness?? Looks agenda driven to me.

Thoughts? I cant promise that Ill be very active this week, as Im planning an event for 10,000 people on Thursday... Celebrate Davis at Community Park, 4:309:15pm (fireworks at 9pm). I hope that youll stop by the ChamberPACs booth at that event and learn more about your well intentioned efforts.

Best,
Kemble Users/KemblePope

Alzada Users/AlzadaMagdalena

20120517 12:46:06 nbsp Thank you Scott!  The box and color is awesome.  I copied and pasted boxes into the Diamond Way and Healing Arts pages and I think they look so great!  I appreciate you taking the time to make it possible.  What computer language is this?  Is it HTML?  I am doing everything simply be copying and pasting and following the directions on the wiki, but it would be nice to know what I am working with so I can look it up elsewhere.
Thanks! Alzada Users/AlzadaMagdalena

20120517 12:49:17 nbsp Since we are corresponding, is there some way to make the Wikis comments run from more recent to most antique?  So one could instantly see what the latest stuff is?

20120606 16:03:28 nbsp Yeah, I figured I might have to explain beyond the edit comment.  Its pretty much as I wrote: its been in transition for a long time, and that version is actually better than the other (although it does have a ton of stuff stripped out that should go back in).  If its not clear, I do think it should be reverted and then the rewrite finished.  However, it stagnated halfway, and notideal (the stripped version) is somewhat better than unreadable, repetitive mess.  Keep in mind that regular editors read with a wiki editors eye, able to jump around and read the notations.  Somebody trying to actually read that page wouldnt really be able to follow easily. Users/JabberWokky

Thompson might very well be autistic or Aspergers.  All the signs are there.  Someone with Aspergers, unless theyve worked at it for a long long time, literally has no idea how damaging just speaking the truth can be.  I can imagine him getting into a social encounter, getting his ass handed to him, and figuring next time all he has to do to avoid a similar situation is to not deal with a Hispanic male.  He was careful not to break any laws and to speak in a nonaggressive tone.  Im disappointed that you, often the defender of people on the mental disorder spectrum would ignore the possibility of him having an issue.  One last comment.  Thompson broke no laws.  He does not deserve to die, as you have implied.  Its also the responsibility of retail stores to take the higher ethical ground.

 Users/JimStewart
    JimI am a former Social Worker that worked with Aspergers & autistic folks. Were you there? Did you directly witness the behavior? With respect to you, I think youre reading too much into Users/.thompsons comment. While I think the death comment was harsh, I think youve gone the opposite way. I dont see those signs...I see someone who had a bad experience and has developed an unfortunate (and unfair) prejudgement of all Hispanic males. Users/PeteB

     Im Aspergers.  Ive spent the last 30 years socializing myself.  I know a little bit about it.  I didnt say he had Aspergers, I tried to say that maybe he does and maybe we shouldnt be in such a rush to judgement. Users/JimStewart
