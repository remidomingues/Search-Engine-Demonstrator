20080901 13:08:26 nbsp Those actually werent sarcastic.  Thats from wiki:wikipedia:Robin Williams who was raised and is Episcopalian (according to interviews, at any rate).  I actually figured it was an urban legend (like many comedic lists attributed to various comedians and famous figures), but it appears to be an actual list he read on HBO and is reproduced on several Episcopal Church websites with nary a refutation on the various urban legend debunking sites.  I have a feeling the person who added it was doing so out of a sense of pride in their church. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20080902 09:27:38 nbsp How is that text insulting? Im absolutely serious. I dont see how ANYONE could be offended by it. I say this as a Southern Baptist, whose doctrine parts of that list poke fun at. Users/WilliamLewis

20080913 18:48:26 nbsp Hey Scott, pardon for being presumptuous about what we want to portray on the wiki site.  (You do know I am the same Carrie who is helping out with the site right?)  Anyhow, at first I didnt know it was you, I was a little taken aback.  But anyhow, it is what it is.  I can see the argument that it being offensive to OTHER churches would make it undesirable for our purposes, since we dont want to offend other people...  Im not up for defending it really.  Hope you arent mad.  Anyhow, cheerio! Users/CarrieBishop

20111003 15:57:48 nbsp Hey Scott, there was a wealth of information on the St. Martin page; whyd you http://daviswiki.org/The_Episcopal_Church_of_St._Martin?actiondiff&version261&version160 remove it? Users/TomGarberson

20111011 11:11:57 nbsp What inaccuracies? Id rather fix that than leave out stuff like the difference between rite 1 and rite 2 and who can take communion. Users/WilliamLewis

20111011 11:25:25 nbsp Did they used to meet there? Users/JabberWokky

20111011 11:39:38 nbsp I dont go to St. Martins (Im not even in Davis) nor am I Episcopal. I am, however, quite familiar with Episcopal doctrine and liturgy. The general statements about Episcopal churches were accurate to the best of my knowledge. The information specific to St. Martins seemed reasonable. Youve removed a wealth of information by calling it inaccurate and out of date yet you have declined to specify what was wrong. I am going to restore information about the connection to the Belfry, policies on communion, the difference between the rites, and the notes on episcopal structure (especially with regards to the Church of England), which are all relevant and accurate to the best of my knowledge, unless you can name any specific objections to this material. Its all useful material that the wiki should have. Users/WilliamLewis

20111011 12:27:21 nbsp Im not picking on you or your church. I just want the wiki to be informative. When you delete information from the wiki, you make it less useful. There also seems to be a misunderstanding here when you refer to a page on this wiki as your churchs website. The wiki is a community resource maintained by the community. It belongs to everyone. The church staff is one voice here, but certainly not the only one.

As for your remark on my page, Saying St. Martins goes with the Church of England is not accurate, this is the statement you deleted about the relationship of St. Martins to the Church of England:
 The Episcopal Church originated with the Church of England (hence the name Anglican), headed today by the Right Honorable and Most Reverend Dr. Rowan Douglas Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Today, the Episcopal Churches in the U.S. and around the world are part of the Anglican Communion. The Episcopal Church in the United States retains its own independent leadership and structure; hence it is not subordinate to the Church of England, but traces its spiritual roots there.

The page never said that St. Martins goes with the Church of England. It said that ECUSA (which St. Martins is a part of) is independent of the Church of England, but had its roots there. It also correctly states that ECUSA is part of the Anglican Communion. St. Martins is part of the ECUSA Diocese of Northern California, and thus part of the Anglican Communion, correct? Your bishop is Barry Beisner, correct? Im not terribly in love with the wording, but it seems to be correct.

20111011 13:29:04 nbsp Hey Scott, please take a few minutes and read Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner.  While youre obviously not the owner of the church, it explains some of the principles at play here.  Itll probably help clear up some confusion. Users/TomGarberson
  Or perhaps more appropriately: Welcome to the wiki/Organization Welcome to the wiki  Organization  Users/CovertProfessor

20111011 17:00:40 nbsp People call Episcopal churches Anglican. Its important to explain why. And the Baptists arent in communion with Rome. ECUSA is in communion with the CoE. Different situations. And heck, going further, the liturgy used by the CoE and ECUSA is pretty much identical whereas the Baptists dont use any liturgy, but especially not anything from the Roman Catholic church which is not infrequently called the whore of Babylon in Baptist circles.

But lets ignore that for a bit. Why remove the stuff about the Belfry? Rite 1 and rite 2? Open communion?  Users/WilliamLewis
