20071205 15:11:35 nbsp Hey, if youre carfree and work for the University, take the http://sustainability.ucdavis.edu/focus/commit.html Carfree Campus Pledge during Dec 37th and get on the list of UCD people committed to a more sustainable campus. This is for the Jan 31st Focus on the Nation event about climate change. Users/JoRo

20080303 09:29:27 nbsp Hi Scott, and thanks for the note on WLBP. IF the band had an instrument corral (with monitors) at the end of the ride, and IF they were part of the ceremonial first batch of bikers, THEN they probably could provide the endofride oompah to go with the hoopla. Also, I understand the need for a structured end to the ride, to assure that the number of riders is documented well  perhaps two entry gates & double the tables at which to surrender your sticker? Final thought (for now?): I dont want to commercialize the experience, but in addition to bumper stickers, how about samples of energy bars and sports drinks at the finish. Lord knows that water & good old raisins and peanuts work  but people are amused by free stuff, and manufacturers like 2,000 members of their target audience in one spot. All just thoughts, and nothing happens without someone spending the time & energy. So thank you for yours on Saturday. Users/DougWalter
