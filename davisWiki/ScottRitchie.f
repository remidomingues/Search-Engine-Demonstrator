All of Scotts old wiki information is now wrong and out of date and kinda funny.

He is now an Ubuntu developer using this wiki page: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ScottRitchie


Hello there, I was just curious about the new road / street conventions. Why Blvd w/out a . instead of spelled out as well, and what to do about Ave. and Way and Cir. etc? Users/AmeliaCarlson

What is up with your mostly random new conventions?  Why add The to names that dont have it? Users/JevanGray Jevan

Explanation for new street convention:

There were some contradictions among the existing links, so the previous method of having St. didnt quite seem right.  Also, it wasnt being strictly adhered to  Olive Drive, for example, was not Olive Dv.  This way seems more intuitive, and I think I got the last of the changes.  Its also the way Wikipedia does it.

I didnt change Blvd to its elongated spelling because I couldnt remember how to spell it, heh.  Change it if you like.  Users/ScottRitchie Scott

20050820 04:51:18 nbsp this the same scott that hid in the sex hole? Users/MichelleAccurso

20050820 16:35:46 nbsp Yes. Users/ScottRitchie

20050830 11:23:44 nbsp Perquisites is a legitimate word, and is actually the source of perks when used in the sense of benefits. Dumbing down is fine, though.  ; ) Users/AlphaDog

20070617 03:45:52 nbsp Hey, if you ever come back through town and feel like giving a talk about any of the cool stuff you work on Lugod would love to host. Users/AlexMandel

20120922 12:44:23 nbsp Ricos while still active in woodland had a location in Davis. But for the most part Woodland centric stuff can be moved to respective wiki Users/StevenDaubert

20120922 14:08:02 nbsp A lot of us want to keep such pages on the Davis Wiki because they have a Davis perspective.  Please dont move them.

20120924 13:24:14 nbsp Personally, I agree with CP.  Having a copy on WW doesnt mean it needs to be deleted off DW. Users/JabberWokky

20120924 13:50:33 nbsp Hi Scott, I guess Im not sure what you meant by moving the entries. If you mean deleting entries from DW, then I think most editors would disagree with that. If you just mean copying and pasting content from Davis Wiki to Woodland Wiki, then I would be okay with that, assuming there isnt already content on the Woodland Wiki regarding a given subject. Id also highly encourage the addition of intertwiki links in instances where they dont already exist. I think its reasonable to add a disclaimer to all entries regarding Woodland topics that appear on Davis Wiki, such as This entry represents the opinions of the Davis Community regarding a business or whatever it is located in Woodland. For perspectives from the Woodland community, please check out Interwiki link. Users/ScottMeehleib
  Yup.  Thats what Ive advocated in the past, and personally, I dig it.  It allows local perspective on things that are relevant to both communities.  A few regional things, like the Sacramento airport, will probably have distinct entries on most of the local wikis in the region, with specific notes on how best to get there, perspective from the local culture, etc. jw
  We already have an include for this exact issue for Sacramento locations.  Itd be easy enough to put one together for Woodland. Users/TomGarberson
  Include(Davis to Sac)
  Is there a way to transclude things from a different wiki?  Surely the Davis/Woodland pages could at least share some data like the address/phone number template  Users/ScottRitchie

20121005 19:05:13 nbsp Nope, not as of now. Users/JabberWokky

20121006 14:39:37 nbsp The current software (Sycamore) is not really being maintained.  Some patches have been proposed (even written) but havent been applied, as the main thrust of development is toward localwiki.org right now, which is oriented as a solution for community wikis.  Im also working on a side project (which is actually about to launch any day now) as an option for the noncommunity wikis in wikispot.   Users/JabberWokky
