Scott Lay was a student at UC Davis, getting a B.A. in Political Science and a J.D. from King Hall.

Lay is the current President and CEO of the Community College League of California.  He was one of the main forces behind February 2008 Primary Election Proposition 92 (2008), which could have provided a ton of funding for community colleges had it passed.  He ran for Davis City Council as a student in 1996.

20080615 21:07:06 nbsp Not exactly sure when he was a student, or I would have posted it.  1995 is one year I know for sure, but I dont have a lot of notes on the 1990s due to the kind of research Ive been doing. Users/BrentLaabs

20080616 18:10:38 nbsp I was a student from 9496 (undergrad) and 9700 (law). The LSA wasnt part of GSA when I was in law school, which became a conflict when GSA negotiated for the Facilities and Campus Enhancement initiative (FACE), which funded the stadium, aquatics facility, ARC, and several outreach programs. Additionally, we were frustrated because the 500 law students were included in the upordown vote with the other 20,000 or so students at the time.

As law students, we fought it because the outreach and financial aid programs were only available to undergrad and academic graduate students.  Since we didnt object to the facilities, we recrafted a fee initiative with outreach and loan forgiveness money for law students, called it LEAAP, and approved it.

Although people occasionally say that I was part of ASUCD, thats also incorrect. I was cofounder of UC Davis College Democrats with Ceclia EscamillaGreenwald, member of the UC Planning and Budget Committee and member of the California Student Aid Commission.  I was always an outsider to ASUCD.  :( Users/ScottLay
