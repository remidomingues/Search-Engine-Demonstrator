Scott Weltz is one of Davis Olympic athletes, competing in the 2012 Olympics in the 200m breaststroke.  Many Davisites contributed to a http://www.gofundme.com/scottweltz fund to send Weltz to the Olympics.  He was 7th in the heats, qualifying him for the semifinals; 4th in the semifinals, qualifying him for the finals; and then 5th in the finals.

Weltz was a member of the nowdefunct Mens UC Davis Swimming and Diving Team. He wore a UC Davis Aggies tshirt at the news conference following his win at the U.S. Olympic trials, perhaps hoping to spur the reincarnation of the team.  Weltz is coached by Pete Motekaitis, former coach of the mens UCD team and now associate head coach of the womens team; sometimes Weltz trains with the women, but many times its just him and Motekaitis.  His story inspired http://www.latimes.com/sports/olympics/olympicsnow/lasponlondonolympicsscottweltzmichaelphelpsunitedstatesswimming20120802,0,2057177.story an LA Times article, in which Weltz says hes going to keep swimming after the 2012 Olympics and see how far he can go.

As a UC Davis studentathlete, Weltz won the Big West Conference Male Athlete of the Year honors in both 2009 and 2010. He also was cowinner of the 2010 Colby Babe Slater Colby E. Babe Slater Award as UC Davis outstanding male athlete of the year.

Weltz is an assistant coach for the AquaMonsters Swim Team.
