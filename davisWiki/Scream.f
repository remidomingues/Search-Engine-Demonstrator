This is an activity occasionally pursued by people who are very stressed out, such as those who are taking Finals final exams.  Screaming too much might get you either a noise ordinance gag or a Music Scene gig.  Hooting and hollering is a common activity of some people engaged in a zest for life.  Mmmm... Davis is zesty...

While one might state the phrase I Scream, they may well be searching for ice cream, which is an entirely different Kettle Corn kettle of Siamese Fighting Fish fish.

In the city of Davis, you can find Screaming Squeegee squeegees that scream, and head just a bit north to find an entire Woodland Corn Maze field of screams, although only Halloween seasonally.  Even more spooky, you might hear screams coming from the Baxter House.

If you hear a large group of students screaming, it my be one of the UC Davis Home Football Games.  Or there has been a Zombie Attack Response Guide zombie invasion.

Or you might just be at a http://www.youtube.com/watch?vIKudm65Dhek&featureplayer_embedded City Council Meeting.
