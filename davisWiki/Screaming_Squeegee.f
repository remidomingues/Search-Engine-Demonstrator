History

The Screaming Squeegee was cofounded by two UC Davis students while they were still undergraduates.  The company was eventually sold to its current owner, Greg Garcia in June of 2006 after being owned for a very brief period by another party (Jason Steenbergen). Mr. Garcia graduated from UC Davis in 1993 and is an area native, having family in both Davis and Sacramento.

Davis contains many companies providing business to business services.


20050915 19:21:03  According to Screaming Squeegees ad on KSAC 1420, they are womanowned and womanoperated. Is this false or should the he above be a she?  Users/KenjiYamada

20050915 22:20:26  As far as I know, the Squeegee is coowned by a man and a woman (cant remember names. I think she is Kristen and I know he wears bow ties a lot. They also have many female employees.  Users/JanelleAlvstadMattson

20060527 17:52:14 Actually, most recently Cristin sold the company to a foreign real estate agent from Vacaville. Employees are leaving right and left and placing orders there now is getting rather sketchy..... The current owner is actually working on selling the business as well, after only a short time or ownership.  Users/MikeBrana

The owner in connection to this posting is no longer associated with Screaming Squeegee.  The current owner took ownership in June of 2006.  The author of this posting, Mike Brana, was rehired by the current owner after being let go by previous owner and was considered a valuable team member.  Greg Garcia, Owner

20100629 15:08:50 nbsp Im afraid I didnt catch the name of the woman I spoke with on the phone today, but she said she was the office manager.  She was exceptionally friendly and helpful.  I called to see about getting a sign made for the Wiki for tabling at the farmers market.  We ended up getting a banner donated elsewhere before we got back in touch, but I wouldnt hesitate to work with Screaming Squeegee in the future.  A few years ago, Screaming Squeegee made our Relay for Life team some tshirts, too.  We provided plain shirts, and they did the printing and design for free, as I recall.  Extremely nice, generous people! Users/TomGarberson

20110303 23:16:13 nbsp I hesitate to bad mouth anyone, but I feel like a large portion of what Daviswiki is good for is telling all sides of the story. These guys make great throw away shirts; low quality tees, cornercut printing standards (no primer? really), bad color mixing (if any). The customer service is alright, in the sense that theyre nice to you while theyre shitting on your wallet. Will I go back to these guys? Maybe, if I need any more throw away shirts, but I wouldnt ask them to do another multicolor print. I will graciously recommend SS to anyone looking for a single color print, perhaps company picnics, res hall shirts, or community service events.

But, like I said, nice ownership, which is pretty outstanding. Thanks for smiling. Users/TerrenceMurphy
