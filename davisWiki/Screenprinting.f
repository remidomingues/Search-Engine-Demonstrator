Screenprinting is the art a stencil method of print making in which a design is imposed on a screen of silk or other fine mesh, with blank areas coated with an impermeable substance, and ink is forced through the mesh onto the printing surface.

Almost anything flat can be screened, and is a perfect medium for Tshirt designs, posters, and other apparel.
