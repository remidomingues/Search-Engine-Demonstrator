They sell Starbucks coffee, cookies, pastries, and some breakfast foods. They have a place that makes deli sandwiches, as well as a grill serving everything from burgers (beef, chicken, garden) to cheesesteaks to even grilled cheese sandwiches, as well as hot dogs and sausages. You could also get more unique, tasty things such as the pineapple chicken teriyaki sandwich, or some kind of taco and bean salad.  The TexMex grill serves Quesadillas, tacos, and other mexican food. They do have premade sandwiches as well as a variety of salad types.  The cafe is large, clean, has plenty of seating space, a couple of tvs, and vending machines as well for those in a rush.  It also has MOObile Net wireless internet to those with a UCD login.
