NOTE: Due to budget cuts, for the time being NO scuba courses are taught on campus whatsoever.

There is a student organization, The Scuba Club at UC Davis (Aggie Scuba), which can help students interested in getting certified by connecting them with local shops. For more info, visit their website at http://AggieScuba.com or their Facebook page at http://www.Facebook.com/AggieScuba. They also have a DavisWiki.

At one point there was a local dive shop, Octopus Garden that offered a wide range of training.
