Based on availability in the local restaurants, seafood seems to be of moderate popularity in Davis. Nonetheless, only Fishs Wild and the numerous sushi restaurants are known for offering a significant variety of species. There are several types of seafood that are nearly ubiquitous in both the highend and lowend sushi shops of Davis; these include salmon, tuna, eel, mackerel, softshell crab, clams, baby octopus, and yellowtail.

Fish n chips, clam chowder, shrimp, scallops, squid, mussels, and oysters can also be found fairly easily. In general, restaurants that serve Asian cuisines often have a fair selection of seafood dishes. Most of the restaurants that carry interesting seafood selections are mom n pop style establishments with menus that have changed very little throughout the years.

 Seafood Labeling 
Bear in mind that http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/27/science/earth/27fish.html mislabeled seafood is extremely common.  Studies around the country have found that an average of 2025% of the seafood sold in stores and restaurants is mislabeled.  In some cases this is due to the restaurant trying to save money, giving the consumer a cheap fish while charging for an expensive one.  Sometimes the restaurant or grocer has been duped by their fish supplier.  One http://www.npr.org/2011/10/24/141663207/bostonglobeinvestigatesmislabeledfishinrestaurants study by the Boston Globe targeted red snapper, white tuna, local (to Boston) cod, and haddock, all identified as commonly mislabeled fish.  They found across 134 restaurants, supermarkets, and fish markets across Massachusetts that 48% of those fish were mislabeled.  Red snapper was particularly bad: 24 out of 26 samples tested were mislabeled.  To date, only two Davis restaurants have been tested on their business practices. A http://www.kcra.com/news/15238831/detail.html KCRA 3 expose showed that Fuji Chef and Sushi Nobu served tilapia mislabeled as red snapper. The Mikuni in Davis was not tested, but the Sacramento location was found to use genuine red snapper.

 Sustainability 
Some 70% of the fisheries in the world are being harvested at an unsustainable rate, i.e. were eating the fish faster than theyre reproducing.
