How I Work
There is no greater display of strength than seeking support when you need it. I am interested in the journey that has taken you to this moment and I will provide a nonjudgmental and collaborative space to explore your story, your feelings, and your hopes for the future. I believe that we are all vulnerable to finding ourselves stuck in patterns that dont serve us well. I also believe in every persons ability to lead a fulfilling life and to maintain relationships that are meaningful, trusting, and rewarding.

I am an experienced meditator and meditation instructor, which influences my style and my approach to therapy. I truly enjoy my work as a Counselors and Therapists therapist and approach it with both humor and with respect for the trust and courage that my clients are demonstrating by showing up each week. It is no easy feat to let go and to experience ourselves as we are.

I have a background as an artist and hold a Masters in Performance Studies from New York University. Through this previous career, I have a special understanding of, and appreciation for, the lives and struggles of creative people, whether they identify as artists or not.

Lastly, I maintain a personal and professional dedication to social justice, and have presented nationally on the subject of applying social justice to clinical work. I work well with clients from a variety of backgrounds and have interest and experience in working with clients who are dealing with oppression, stigma, or discriminationwhether it be related to race, gender, nationality, sexual orientation, age, class, or ability.
