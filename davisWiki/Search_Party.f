Search Party is MUSE, The California Aggies arts and entertainment magazine, and KDVS 90.3 FMs annual judged musical composition competition. It is open to all student Music Scene musicians, bands or solo artists of any genre.

Official Press Release for 2008 Search Party:

Third Annual Search Party: Davis, Sponsored by the ASUCD Entertainment Council, KDVS 90.3 FM and The California Aggie

	Student musicians, the spotlights are searching for you! It’s time for the annual campus media sponsored Search Party talent show. Cosponsored by KDVS 90.3 FM, The California Aggie and now the ASUCD Entertainment Council, Search Party gives UC Davis’ budding musicians the opportunity to perform to the campus community. Submissions will be due by 4 p.m. on Friday April 18 to the office of KDVS 90.3 FM, located at 14 Lower Freeborn Hall.
	The Search Party will take place in three rounds. First, all submissions will be listened to and judged by a panel of Entertainment Council, KDVS and Aggie staff representatives. Based on this judging four winners will be announced, which will be given spreads in the May 8th issue of MUSE as well as air time on a KDVS show best fit the following week. The third round will be the live component — the four finalists will perform at the ASUCD Coffee House May 21 and be awarded cash prizes based on attendee’s votes.
	Please join the facebook.com event group under the ASUCD Entertainment Council, look to issues of MUSE and listen to KDVS 90.3 for more information on the Search Party event.

Rules of entry are as follows:
•	Music group must include at least one UC Davis student or alumni.
•	Paid staff members of campus media groups (KDVS 90.3. FM, The California Aggie and ASUCD Entertainment council) need not apply.
