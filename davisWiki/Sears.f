The local Sears store was a small stripmall location, not one of the larger department stores or industrial supply stores.  They sold appliances and did repair and took returns from any Sears location.  They closed in 2006. The location is currently occupied by Tuesday Morning.

In the 1970 70s and 1980 80s, Sears had a small catalog store at the southeast corner of G Street and 3rd Street (also the former location of Strelitzia Flower Co).

But I Must Have Sears!


The closest locations that are open is the http://www.searshometownstores.com/0003249.html Sears in Woodland and a few Sears in Sacramento, one at the Arden Fair Mall.
