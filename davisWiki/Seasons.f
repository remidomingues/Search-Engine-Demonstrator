Seasons is a casual Upscale Restaurants upscale restaurant located across from the Regal Cinemas Davis Holiday 6 F Street movie theater, next to Hallmark Inn. Seasons emphasizes the use of fresh ingredients from local food local farms, and their menu changes every three months (hence their name).  Seasons supports local farmers and ranchers and buys locally produced ingredients whenever possible. Guests can expect nightly specials and childrens menus are available.

Davis is located close to Napa Valley, Sonoma Valley, Central Coast and Sierra Foothills http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appellation appellations, so in addition to an abundance of locally produced fresh foods there is also access to many world class wineries.  The Seasons wine list features mostly regional wines and specially notes local wines and wines produced by Viticulture and Enology UC Davis alumni.  Wine is offered by the glass, half bottle and full bottle.  Guest can bring their own wines for a $12 corkage fee.

Specials  Seasons hosts the popular $3,4,5 Happy Hour Specials Happy Hour every Tuesday through Friday, from 5:00PM to 7:00PM.  A range of small dishes are available for $3,4,5; $3 draft beers, $4 wine specials and $5 cocktail specials.   On Thursdays, ALL bottles of wine are HALF price. For the time being, the $1 oysters special is not available. In addition to the diverse menu, weekly and nightly dinner specials are also offered. Their Facebook page has the latest announcements.


Seating  Indoor seating offers several different options including intimate booth tables and larger round tables.

In 2010, an enclosed outdoor seating outdoor patio was added in the back of the restaurant which seats up to 75 guests sitting or 100+ standing.  The patio is heated and cooled, so it can be enjoyed year round.  Its especially nice to sit on the new patio if you like to watch trains roll through the iconic Train Station Davis Train Station, not so much if you dont.  NOTE: Unlike other restaurants in Davis with outdoor or patio seating, Seasons does NOT allow dogs.

The Private Dining Room is available for receptions, rehearsal dinners, birthdays, anniversaries, holiday parties, and company meeting rooms meetings. The private room seats up to 40 guests or 60 standing, has audiovisual capabilities, privacy shades, and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_d%27h%C3%B4te prix fixe menus. The cherry wood cabinets house the restaurants wine collection and french doors divide the room from the outside patio and main dining room.  Guests can have complete privacy and still enjoy the views.

Ambiance  Live music is featured every second Thursday of the month.  A large wood burning oven adds warmth and coziness to the restaurant while baking their tasty pizzas and other appetizers and entrees.  During the spring, summer, and fall months the soothing slate waterfall in the outdoor patio attracts many hummingbirds.

20100206 13:31:07 nbsp Seasons probably has the best food in town if you want a full sized restaurant.  Truly the food is excellent.  The only gripe I have is that some of the tables are too, TOO close together.  My husband and I went there for Valentines day last year and ended up walking out.  We were seated only inches from another table. If youre looking for a romantic evening, be sure to request a free standing table, not one with the bench seats along the side of the room.  Theyre actually happy to accommodate that!
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Users/toriac

20100206 13:44:40 nbsp Its not this places fault, but because it used to be a Lyons, I just cant take it seriously as an upscale restaurant.  I need to get over my prejudice and give it a fair try. Users/rfrazier

20100215 15:38:21 nbsp Salt Fest!
We go (should I say went) there all the time, last night was a bad night for Seasons.
Three out of Four of our meals were returned uneatable, the service was horrible, the managers were under responsive, lackluster and rude.
All around bad experience – We will not be going back any time soon, if ever!
Two hours after ordering we received our desserts. When our check finally came, the manager made the server offer us our drinks free. By this time it was way too late!
If they made the offer 1 hour earlier when we returned our food, we would have been fine with that. The fact that Three meals were less than half eaten and returned due to the way over seasoned salty food I felt they could have done better that! Complimentary $25 worth of drinks? For a Valentines dinner for four? with slow, bad service?
After telling the waiter the way we felt, the manager finally came over to talk to us, 2 hours after we ordered, 1 hour after we returned our food, and all he had to say was well what do you (us the customer) want me (the manager) to do? Isnt that His job to know what to do? He made us feel like we were the bad guy! There is way to many good restaurants in this area for them to treat, hardworking, incredibly patient, local, customers that way. All we want is decent service and a good meal.

Shame on Seasons! Mulvayneys is Awsome, well worth the short trip to downtown Sac. Bistro has been really good lately! The new thai place is pretty good.

   Im not a huge Seasons fan myself; its ok, but its not my sort of place.  However, I feel compelled to respond to your post above.  If there was a restaurant I had gone to many times happily, I would not write it off just because of one bad night.  Any restaurant can have a bad night  especially on Valentines Day.  I always try to go out on some night during the same week rather than the day itself, exactly because Vday tends to be a horrible dining experience.  As for the manager asking you what you wanted, that is a form of customer service: we know we screwed up, what can we do to make it right for you? rather than giving you something that you wont find sufficient or that you dont want. You werent happy with the $25 comped drinks, so you might have tried telling the manager what it was that you did want.  I guess what I am saying is that Id give them another try.

20100216 01:15:04 nbsp I was here for Vday and everything was fine with the exception that my steak was over seasoned. Users/RossD

20100329 15:51:21 nbsp The manager ThomasToomas? is very rude and paranoid. Always looking behind with shifty eyesnever says thank youThe food is not bad, however the delivery takes away what might taste good. One ex worker said they do things to the food to people they dont like. Make sure you eat inside. The new outside addition is good if you want to look at the backside of SUVs and inhale exhaustWHAT A VIEW! The wine list is suspectA LOT of unknown wines at wall street prices and serve this god awful Hungarian wine that should be called swill. Give it a go, however, do not expect gratitude or a complimentary anything. Users/BillBlades

20100410 18:30:38 nbsp Came here again the other night and the food was not as tasty as I had expected it would be.

It was average fare. Some of it somehow tasted as though it had been frozen and thawed...

However, the prices are pretty good considering and I am looking forward to trying lunch here sometime. Users/KenichiSan

20100429 15:25:25 nbsp Seasons has that delicious smokey open oven smell that I love. There menu changes every so often. The peaches with gorgonzola and honey are my favorite. I have had the salmon once and it was incredible. I usually just order a bunch of apps because they are all so unique. One of my favorite places to eat Users/Ldish949

20100726 14:27:50 nbsp Went here for lunch last week. Excellent food and service as usual. However, Id like to know why the Host was dressed so casually while the rest of the staff were wearing black pants and white shirts? Stonewashed jeans and a plaid shirt seemed so out of place for the host when everyone else was dressed different... Users/jsbmeb

20100804 14:46:43 nbsp I think Seasons is the best restaurant in Davis. I think it might appear very upscale and pricey but its not pretentious and I have never had a bad experience. In my opinion the food is always absolutely delicious with a nice presentation and great service. The lunches are a great value. The sandwiches are large and come with a wonderful side dish ( the soups are to die for)I have written about their pizzas before and today I had the mushroom pizza and a beautiful spinach salad with Gorgonzola dressing.It was to die for. I eat out often and they are the best. They even have delicious, strong iced tea. My glass was never empty. It seams that they work well as a team and have a delightful staff.  Users/ashleyinthemist

20100907 18:33:34 nbsp Outstanding restaurant.  Very original dishes using fresh local ingredients. Users/DavidBarry

20101024 22:13:03 nbsp Seasons is one of the better restaurants in Davis. This evening I had the Sunday specialroast turkey with cranberry sauceand the Lil Gem
Romaine salad with poached pears. I liked the turkey and would order it again. The salad was good, but I forgot my RULE about ordering salads: dressing
on the side. Mary, our server, was excellent and really knows the wine list. Tonight she recommended the Sangiovese Vino Noceto.  Its a very good red wine.
What surprised me was that Mary remembered the wine I ordered several weeks ago. My daughter gave the smoked braised pork high marks. She
also thought they added too much dressing to her spinach salad. We shared the double chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream which was delicious. I was surprised
to see so many people there this evening that I know. All in all the food was very good but dont forget the RULE about ordering salads.

20101027 01:04:40 nbsp We go quite regular to Seasons with my colleagues after seminars. Recently we got somewhat disappointed with the menu as it became rather dull and ordinary. I would expect some more exciting dishes from a restaurant in the category fine dining. In terms of starters, Butternut Squash Bisque is a good choice. I also enjoyed WoodFired Sonoma Goat Cheese. Previously they served smelts but unfortunately it disappeared from the menu. The problem starts with the main dishes. Nothing special. You could have similar dishes in many other restaurants. The Smoked Braised White Marble Farms Pork was nicely tender but rather heavy (i.e. more heavy than expected from a pork dish). The Sautéed Scottish Salmon is also disappointing. The vegetables were almost flavorless. In contrast, the crust of the salmon was too spicy/salty. What is the composition here? The other dishes are burger, steak, and chicken  what an outburst of culinary creativity! Dining is about enjoyment, indulgence and discovery of flavors. It should not degenerate to the unpleasant task of filling the stomach. A long standing complaint of mine is the lack of a good chocolate dessert. For years they got only this dull chocolate brownie. Every other decent restaurant in Davis does better on the desserts than seasons. The Crème Brulee is acceptable. The wines are good. Recently they added a patio for dining outside, which is quite nice. The restaurant inside can become quite noisy sometimes. Perhaps a carpet or similar could dim the noise. To sum up, you need to do better Seasons and in terms of food you did better in the past. Users/bcschipper

20101103 16:08:22 nbsp My family and I have been going to Seasons at least once or twice a month for years. All of us have very different preferences when it comes to fine dining, and Seasons has never failed to please us  even my daughter who is (currently)vegetarian. The wait staff, especially Chris (now departed for Seattle) and Mary, are very knowledgeable about the food and wine menus and helpful in accomodating special offmenu requests, and are of the highest professional quality. They are often able to suggest variations of the menu presentations that will satisfy my daughters requirements, as well as recommend interesting wine pairings that get me out of my usual wine rut. Jackie, the bartender, is paticularly engaging and entertaining, as well as being an educated and excellent mixologist. Tomas, the owner, is a family guy, very personable and genuinely dedicated to presenting the finest dining experience without being stuffy and pretentious. In short, Seasons is utterly comforting and comfortable as a dining or bar destination. While I can appreciate differing points of view, some of the reviews above come off as patricularly snarky and nearslanderous hack jobs, adding nothing to the quality of restaurant reviews. Come on people  post that kind of stuff on your Facebook page. Users/JohnBonner

20101103 16:55:47 nbsp Ive been here a few times for law school events, and recently brought my folks for Sunday brunch.  The outside patio is fantastic.  Service is great, whether its for four people or a group of 60+ ranging from students to deans to state supreme court justices and appellate judges.  I havent been enough to really comment on variety or the menu at large, but Ive very much enjoyed everything Ive tried at Seasons.  Oh, and if you go for brunch, be sure to try the Salmon Hush Puppies! Users/TomGarberson

20110617 17:35:37 nbsp I LOVE Seasons! The food is wonderful. The service is great and the prices are reasonable. My favorite restaurant is Davis by far.  Users/Sherri

20110823 08:36:47 nbsp I recently had my wedding reception at the Seasons Restaurant. They really made my day special. They printed out special menus for my guests, added tasteful decor to the room, and stored my cake while we ate. The service was great. Normally with a large group its difficult to serve everyone at once. But at Seasons all of us were able to enjoy the delicious food together. The food was great and so was the service. Users/nkristis

20120403 08:20:16 nbsp We had brunch at Seasons this past Sunday. The service was excellent, but the food was meh.  Prettylooking salads, but dried out frittatas and eggs. Lukewarm lattes.
Much tastier food almost anywhere (everywhere) in Davis.
We wont be returning. Users/Chamoudah

20120706 17:09:12 nbsp Once again I will share my opinion on Seasons. I go (have lunch mostly), sometimes dinner, often and always have the most exceptional service. The food is always incredible. Allen in particular is a fine waiter. I was there today with a friend. I had a great meal. My friend who is extremely picky, loved his Cobb Salad! Please stop by sometime and give it a try. For those who have had a negative experience please give them another shot!

20121026 10:58:27 nbsp I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT BACK ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO THEY HAD A STELLAR STAFF, NOT THAT THE KIDS THEY HAVE NOW ARE BAD JUST NOT     FINE DINING EXPERTS THAT THEY HAD. WELL PEOPLE THAT KNOW ME KNOWS THAT I DINE AT THE FINEST RESTAURANTS IN THE WORLD.I GUESS THE SERVICE COMES FROM YEARS OF TRAINING. CHRIS WAITED ON ME BACK IN 2008 HE TOLD ME THAT WITH THE TEAM HE WAS WORKING THEY HAD OVER A HUNDRED YEARS OF KNOWLEDGE AND IT SHOWED.TODAY IT SHOWS THAT THE MANAGEMENT OR THE OWNERS HAVE LOST MAJOR PLAYERS IN THE ART OF FINE DINING.THEY ALSO NEED TO NOT BUY PRODUCTS AT THE SUPERMARKET IF THEY WANT TO SAY ITS FARM FRESH.I KNOW PEOPLE THAT MISLEAD THAT WILL BE NOTICED.WORD TO THE OWNERS GET BACK TO THE BASICS HIRE THE BEST IF YOU NEED TO PAY, THEN PAY YOU WILL MAKE THE PLACE WHAT IT WAS, I AM SURE YOU SEE IT ON YOUR BOTTOM LINE.ALL I CAN SAY IS YOU SHOULD HIRE PROPER MANAGEMENT THAT KNOWS THE BUSINESS. SHOULD HAVE 20+YEARS IN THE BUSINESS OF FINE DINING NOT FRESH OUT OF SCHOOL. WELL IT IS YOUR MONEY GOOD LUCK YOU WILL NEED IT.TRAIN YOUR MANAGERS TO TRAIN YOUR STAFF. Users/MIKEDUNN
 Caps Lock.  Its cruise control for cool.

20121202 19:42:33 nbsp As someone who has dined at Seasons over the years, I couldn’t help but notice that “MIKEDUNN” and “bythelchafin” have the same IP address which means that both users are either sharing a computer or it’s the same person. Suspiciously, “MIKEDUNN” has the same IP address as “BIGBALU” on the Our House page which “MIKEDUNN” also posted on. It’s interesting how all three users have posted comments with the same general recurring theme (when read altogether) of how the management of Seasons was so incompetent to let Jeff go and how Our House would be so wise to hire him or someone like him. Further, these comments read more like rants rather than constructive consumer advice since no specifics are ever mentioned. What is most interesting is that Jeff’s full name is Jeff Bythel Chafin, which I remember as it’s pretty unique. Hmmm, maybe it’s just one overwhelming coincidence or possibly an unemployed bartender who really just wants to server up some sour grapes. Users/DavisBarFly

20130302 14:13:06 nbsp My experience is about the same as Chamoudahs. Ate there a few times, but unfortunately the taste has always been bland for me (pasta once; lamb another time), and Ive been studying and cooking European cuisine since I were a kid, so that probably makes me pickier when it comes to places like Seasons. I wouldnt have considered it overpriced if I had enjoyed the food. Not to say its not good, I guess its just a matter of taste compared to other fine dining places Ive been in Davis.

Side note: Wish the Nightly Specials were treated to a description that goes beyond the name of the dish. Ask about the way it is served and the accompanying dishes to avoid any surprises. Users/DavisSite

20130730 15:38:11 nbsp The food is great as is the service, but the owners are some of the most entitle rich people that I have met. They apparently own both the restaurant and the inn, but then do not treat the restaurant staff very well. What kind of people eat at their own restaurant and then do not tip the server? I will not be supporting local business owners who act in such a deplorable manner. Users/paigedavis
  The owners of season do not own the inn. They used to work as waitresses at the crepe bistro ~SD

20131104 20:30:29 nbsp Wow, Davis sure has some whiney, sappy people who like to complain. I would love to know what is in the criteria of a great experience. Maybe a foot rub at the end of dinner?  Users/miguelitogonsales

20131130 nbsp My parents were visiting from out of town for Thanksgiving, and we had dinner at Seasons on Wednesday night. It was superb! We started with cocktails (theres one with bourbon in it that was especially good) and had the deviled eggs with lobster. They were worth the trip alone! For our main dishes, I had the lamb shank, which was very delicious, my boyfriend had the duck, my dad had the cod, and my mom had the turkey meatballs. Every thing was very delicious, and our waiter was very polite and helpful. An all around enjoyable experience. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a special dinner. Im planning to go back for happy hour soon! Users/SiobhanOK

Ive been to seasons: Its nice that the menu changes seasonally. When I went most recently I got the short ribs. They fell off the bone and were amazing. The folks also hit it up consistently so that is a big seal of approval Daubert

20140610 20:25:58 nbsp I personally love Seasons food and the service if you get a regular table. If you get the bar service, be aware that apparently your server has 10 bar patrons, 4 tables, and makes drinks for the entire restaurant so plan accordingly. The menu is limited but superb and not amazingly flexible if you want substitutions, you will pay A LOT. Perhaps youre already planning to pay alot since youre going to Seasons but double your estimate and then youll be in the ballpark. If youre dirty or dont have a reservation, they wont seat you and if they do, theyll act like theyre in too much of a rush to accommodate to your experience. In the end, if youre old and conventional and welldressed and apparently rich, have a great dinner!  Users/JaneBF
