Seattles Best Coffee was the cafes cafe located inside of Borders. They served the usual coffee and tea drinks plus a limited selection of sweets and sandwiches. They had many comfy chairs and a good number of tables. It was a popular study spots study spot; in the past, Borders enforced a strict one hour time limit to reduce the number of studiers, but new management eliminated that rule. Studiers, readers and chatters can now stay as long as they like. WiFi Hot Spots Wireless internet access was free.

While Borders has always had a cafe, it has not always been a Seattles Best. An old Borders Frequent Drink Card simply says Cafe Espresso, which was likely their inhouse brand.

Seattles Best Coffee was bought by Starbucks in 2003, but Seattles Best still uses their own unique brand of smooth roasted coffee beans. The coffee beans used by Seattles Best have a different flavor than Starbucks. The employees at the cafe are all Borders employees.  Borders contracted in 2004 to turn all their instore cafes into licensed Seattles Best Coffee cafes, thus the branding of the cafe and all cups, napkins, etc, is Seattles Best Coffee, despite Borders being from Ann Arbor, Michigan. The cafe does not accept Starbucks gift cards, but they do accept Borders gift cards. Amusingly, Borders competitor Barnes and Noble brews Starbucks Coffee in their instore cafes and also does not accept Starbucks gift cards since the cafes are owned and operated by Barnes and Noble.

Borders announced in May 2011 that they were going to end their licensing agreement with Seattles Best Coffee. Borders planned to operate their own instore cafes. http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Borderstoendcafepactwithrb2263566604.html?x0&.v1 link

The cafe permanently closed in July of 2011 just before liquidators took control of all of the remaining Borders stores.

You can now find Seattles Best Coffee at Subway and Burger King.


20060913 09:04:47 nbsp During the summer when the flies are out, Borders is the only place without flies. I dont know how they do it, but this is the place to study in July. Also, their hot chocolate is amazing. It comes with chocolate shavings, whipped cream, then a random piece of dark chocolate. Its a dessert, a beverage and caffeine all in one cup.

20080306 21:16:30 nbsp They have a great blended coffee drink called the Oreo Cookie Javakula. It tastes like a light Oreo Cookie milkshake. They also have Orange Mango and Strawberry. They can be made with or without coffee. They also have a hot caramel apple cider. It tastes like hot apple pie. Users/Jedron

20080330 20:39:51 nbsp The hot chocolate is quite excellent here, pretty relaxing atmosphere Users/LizMelack

20080518 23:38:46 nbsp Way better than Starbucks! The Javakulas are good and the lattes are great. Try the Javanilla, its delicious! Made with icecream and coffee, you cant go wrong. It doesnt come in a small though, only medium and large. Overall, everything is great. Even the customer service. Its also a great place to study!  ) Users/LupeDaya

20090915 13:14:54 nbsp There are small cockroaches in the puffy brown seats (reading area) by the window. Not sure if this is Seattless Best Coffees area or Borders. Users/Alex

20100213 16:35:03 nbsp This place is pretty nice. The selection on Tea is a bit small though. The DO have free wireless (just accept their terms and conditions) which is contrary to what this wikipage currently says (so ill change it after leaving this comment).

They also have a Borders reward card thing going on, where you buy a certain amount of drinks and you get the next one free. pretty cool.

the one down side to this Seattles Best Coffee is the lack of Electrical Outlets. If youre looking for a place to plug in your laptop its best to either charge it before you come or go to another place.

20100707 17:33:08 nbsp Mostly wonderful wellmeaning overworked employees. Do not be surprised if one person is taking the orders and preparing drinks for a whole queue of people. The coffee is VERY GOOD. The breakfast sandwiches are a pleasant surprise. They have spinach in with the egg; pretty tasty, with no noticeable grease. No good muffins or croissants unfortunately. This place is very hospitable to people who come in to use the air conditioning, power, and wifi without buying anything, which can be a littler disconcerting considering they take up a lot of room. Leather chairs for relaxing or tables and chairs for meeting. Orangecream and rootbeerish soda pops and bottled teas and juices are sold in addition to the coffee drinks. I think the blended drinks are way too sweet, but my cohort likes them fine. Good chocolate chip cookies. Good air quality in the building if you are avoiding pollen. Users/seesharp
