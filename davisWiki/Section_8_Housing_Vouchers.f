http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src/topics/housing_choice_voucher_program_section_8 Section 8 Housing Vouchers Program is a Federal housing program which provides housing assistance to lowincome renters and homeowners. This assistance comes in the form of rental subsidies, limiting the monthly rent payment of the assistance recipient. If one qualifies, it reduces the rent of a participating facility to roughly 30% of your income. This program has an extremely long waiting period for qualification in light of the new economy we live in. In order to qualify, one must be a lowincome person (below 50% of the Area Median Income). Vouchers, once obtained, are transferable to any state in the nation, so if you obtain one in Davis and find yourself needing to relocate for an reason, you may use your voucher at any facility in the area you are moving to providing they have available units.

Beginning in the 1930s and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_8_(housing)#History constantly changing for the needs of the recipients, Section 8 Vouchers are now the norm for lower than median income earners. The program is intended to provide assistance to those lower income households so that they may increase their productivity and have a little less to worry about, with aid to help them survive and, in some cases thrive. There are congressional requirements for many apartments to provide a certain percentage of units for the purpose of Section 8 Vouchers but most smaller apartment communities are exempt.  Usually it is approximately 10% of all newer complexes, but some apartment communities are designed to be 100%.

One problem for users of the program is the stigma of discrimination and the feeling of worthlessness that comes with it. Its not just the housing complexes, it may be your peers, but there is no need for this feeling to enter your minds. It is designed to aid you to better your life while giving you enough breathing room to function. It is not designed to make you feel inhuman or any other negative view of self worth.

As with many programs designed for the assistance of the poor, the Section 8 Voucher program has come under scrutiny for being abused, allowing a more even spread of criminal activity and for removing motivation from the families involved to improve their life status. Most of these criticisms have been debunked but there are some cases of abuse, and those caught fraudulently using the program or for overextending their vouchers after failing to notify of income increases may face severe criminal penalties.
