Theyre both identical. Therefore, each ones open eye is looking into the others closed eye. Below is a closeup of one of them.


The sculpture is a bit of a jab at lawyers since it is outside King Hall School of Law, and they are talking to each other, but they both lack ears to hear the other, and cant see eye to eye.
