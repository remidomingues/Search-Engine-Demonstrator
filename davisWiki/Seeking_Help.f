When you need help, the best place to ask for it is often on a Talk page.  Talk pages are a place for editors to get help with editing the parent page.  If youre not sure how to fix an image, rephrase a statement to make it nonpromotional, or handle a disagreement over content, a Talk Page is the place to ask for help.

 When to Create a Talk Page 
  You need help figuring out what to do on a page.
  You know what you want to do, but you need help figuring out how to do it.
   Be sure to check out wiki:wikispot Help with Editing first!
  A disagreement over content needs discussion to reach a resolution.  Make sure you read the Wiki Community/Handling Problems page.
  You feel you have a conflict of interest and feel it would be more ethical to propose a change publicly rather than acting directly.

 When NOT to Create a Talk Page 
When you know both what to do on a page and how to do it, you dont need to create a Talk page.  If you think therell be disagreement or questions about your edit, you can explain it using the Please comment about this change: field below the editing area.  If theres a disagreement you cant resolve by touching up the edit, then you may need to resort to a Talk page in order to sort out a solution.  Theres no need to go to a Talk page as your first resort if you know what to do, though.

Dont create a talk page to talk about the parent page.  Thats what the parent page is for!  Information, reviews, etc. all belong on the parent page.

 How to Create a Talk Page 
Step 1: Click the Talk button at the top of the page you want to discuss.



Step 2: Create the page and ask/explain/discuss!
