The Segundo Dining Commons is a new Dining commons dining facility built to serve the food hungry UC Davis students in Segundo and Segundo North.  The Dining Commons is campus located on the south side of Bixby Hall Bixby and Gilmore Hall Gilmore halls in the Segundo housing area, just south of the Old Segundo Dining Commons old dining commons. The new DC has over 900 Comfy Chairs seats and was designed to accommodate diners with more Sleeping On Campus comfort, Bathrooms convenience, and efficiency than the previous DC.

Until the 0910 academic year they had a No Backpack Policy. Students complained about the Dining Commons policy of no backpacks so this year, they are allowed at all Dining Commons.

This project had a long and arduous journey to Fruit Trees fruition.  University construction Construction started in 2003, but the contractor cows responsible for building it went Departed Businesses bankrupt in 2004, and other setbacks such as bad weather delayed its opening until summer 2005.

Originally, the land where the Segundo Dining Commons now stands used to be a large lawn area with basketball courts. It would be common to hear people playing basketball at Segundo until late at night. The basketball courts were demolished and moved to the location of a former outdoor roller hockey rink. Those new basketball courts were later demolished to build the new Student Health and Wellness Center.

20050603 08:47:26 nbsp Im way disappointed by the lack of long tables, though. My floor sometimes goes to eat in groups of 20, itd be lame to have to split up Users/GiladGurantz

20050604 03:55:29 nbsp There are some long tables in the main area but they dont compose the majority of tables like in the existing DC. Users/DerekEllis

20060419 11:40:00 nbsp Apparently theres a fire going on in the Saucy (the pizza place) area of the DC. More details later. Users/TusharRawat

20061101 22:04:19 nbsp There most certainly is a fire in Saucy. There, also, is a big round table tucked away in one of the corners. Users/BrianTrott

20061115 19:47:10 nbsp I go sometimes with my boyfriend (as he has a meal plan) as a nice break from cooking, but I remember the salad bar being way better in the old DC. I did find the tree that used to be in the middle of the path, covered in reflecters to warn bikers, today! Now its happily surrounded by grass. Users/ChristyMarsden

20070118 14:55:05 nbsp Are all these pictures still necessary? Users/CarlosOverstreet

20070118 21:14:03 nbsp I think the pictures are necessary, people need to know! Users/SteveOstrowski

20070119 00:27:45 nbsp The pictures should, I think be moved to a /Pictures page, or more content should be written, so that the page isnt so densely filled with pictures. Users/JosephBleckman

20070207 01:45:41 nbsp what difference would it make if the pictures were on a separate page? Users/VictoriaNieciecki

20080615 01:56:49 nbsp Hey Guys, This place its really amazing!!! If you are in davis you must to try it! Its cheap and is an all you can eat...so Users/Tollboy

20081023 14:56:47 nbsp The security is ridiculous there. If you walk out with an apple and a brownie, the person at the desk will make you eat one before you can go out. One or the other.  Users/Skyao

20090126 18:26:44 nbsp The food is usually on rotation here, but thats whats expected.  Theres always pizza, always some form of hamburgers (even vegetarian patties), and usually chow mein that isnt that authentic, but is popular nonetheless.  The rush hours are about 2 hours before closing, but before it closes, it dies down quickly, although they stop making food and sometimes you end up having less selection.  To Skyao, its policy and it is written in a large poster before entering.  You can leave with ONE item  whether it be a fruit, or a cupcake, or whatever.  Read the sign. Users/tuminator

20090824 18:47:42 nbsp The food is really good here when parents come, but otherwise its pretty feh Users/OrofinJackson

20100215 12:10:55 nbsp This year they have allowed backpacks to be brought in; Ive done it everyday. Users/BryceH

20100215 12:11:42 nbsp to clarify the last comment, I mean I bring my backpack in everyday but I dont take food out of the dc.  Users/BryceH

20110227 09:27:44 nbsp How much does it cost for noncampus affiliates to eat here? I cant find it posted anywhere but Huell Howser mentioned it on his show when he visited UCD. Im looking for a convenient allyoucaneat option for some athletes that isnt too expensive and isnt IHOP. Users/GJC02
  Not convenient, not cheap, not healthy. I know it costs at least ten bucks, but most of the food is disgusting and not very nutritious. Users/hankim
