20090704 13:21:56 nbsp I advise highly against this place. The apartment itself isnt so bad, but the management is terrible. If youre comfortable with a little terrorist popping into your house 24/7 to yell at you about her paper work mixups feel free.
But I warn you, be prepared, document everything before you move. Often the apartment isnt finished being cleaned, and Rita might have selective memories about the details. I would classify this as a slum lord situation. Say good bye to your deposit as soon as ou give it. Dont let her take advantage of you. I repeat, document everything!! Users/Domlertylique

20090705 11:49:54 nbsp Rita is not as bad as the poster above says. She does pop by a lot, but shes just trying to keep her properties up to date. In the end we got our whole deposit back. She even gave us a little extra because we moved out a bit earlier.  Users/brighteyes

20100202 22:25:34 nbsp Domlertyligue,  I hardly ever deduct from the deposit except when door, windows, lighting were broken due to disorderly behavior.  You are welcome to come see me to discuss your charges. Users/RitaSeiber

20100715 00:37:23 nbsp Lived here before. She is pretty bad. Always kept popping in and telling me the place was horrible. It was pretty damn clean. Even my friends said they dont know why she was hassling me. Tried to make me pay for cleaning the carpets and fixing half the stuff in the apartment that was already broken when we got in. Didnt even get half my deposit back Users/David.Tran

20100715 00:40:14 nbsp Oh yeah, she does have a selective memory. Went in to discuss rent before we moved in and then she tried to charge us 100 more when we went to sign the documents. Told her we discussed lowering the rent and she said she had no remembrance of that conversation. Finally she caved because we were not going to sign and she lowered it. Users/David.Tran
