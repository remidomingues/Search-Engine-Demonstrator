20090308 23:16:57 nbsp This totally needs to be resurrected.  Coming back to Davis from last years Operation Restore Maximum Freedom, the KDVS event hosted at Plainfield Station, I got a flat.  Worst yet, I was on my tandem with a gal I had to take home.  I was a dope and risked it that day by not bringing a flat kit.  So, I thought the self service station was still around and walked off looking for it.  Lets just say I was disappointed to see that it no longer to existed.  Walking from Orchard Park Drive to South Davis is not fun. Users/Edward
