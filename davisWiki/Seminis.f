Seminis Vegetable Seed Company is the worlds largest vegetable seed producer in the world. The Woodland site is the second largest research site for Seminis. This site focuses on breeding new hybrid vegetable lines that create better nutrition, crop yield, and flavor. In 2005 Monsanto bought Seminis. Seminis offers internships to about a dozen college students, mostly UC Davis students, in their Vegetable Quality and Nutrition Research Laboratory (VQNRL) also know as the Tomato Lab. Theresa Costa, the current Biotechnology, Crop Science and Management, and Agricultural Management and Rangeland Resources advisor, once had this popular internship.
