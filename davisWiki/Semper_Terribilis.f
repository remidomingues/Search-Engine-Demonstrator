Semper Terribilis is a comic written and drawn by Users/JuliaSands Julie Sands that appeared in the California Aggie from 20062008.

About:
The strip is mostly about an embarrassing professor of an unknown subject and the students that alternately despise and idolize him (it was referred to by a lot of people as the comic with the crazy professor).  It also involved robots, tentacles, and several cows.  One recognizable recurring gag that appeared throughout the strips lifetime was Interdepartmental Dating, in which the main character(s) engaged in an awkward dating scenario based on one of Daviss many majors.  The strips title means Always Terrible in Latin.

In the final comic of the strips twoyear run Sands directed any readers wishing to abuse their artistic sensibilities further to her DeviantArt page, http://indutiae.deviantart.com.

Characters:
  Dr. Martin Stopheles: Undateable professor obsessed with the letter F.  Better known as Dr. S (because Stopheles takes up way too much room in a comic strip).
  Johnny Morris: Doeeyed student who idolizes Dr. S, who he previously claimed was the devil in an obscure Faust reference.
  Alex Ellison: A naive, overworked science student who probably has more than a few ulcers.
  Rohan Harold Dalmiya: Johnny got him to take Dr. Ss awful class.  Surely the most normal of this bunch.
  Dennis Todrunter: The Surliest College Student.
  Dr. Sykes: Never actually named in the strip, he is the handsome, popular opposite of Dr. S.
  Dr. Penders: The balding professor who showed up once in a while.  Also never actually named in the strip.
  Coke Bottle Glasses Professor: Dr. Ss occasional sympathizer.
  The Viticulture Professor: The best thing to happen to Dr. S since his students started playing D&D with him.

Art:
As computers frighten and confuse the artist, everything but the panel boundaries are done by hand with nonphoto blue and mechanical pencils, Micron pens, and Prismacolor markers.  The panel boundaries are drawn digitally with The GIMP, a free downloadable image editing program.

Book:
In the summer of 2008, Sands selfpublished a complete collection of strips that appeared during the twoyear Aggie run.  As of Friday August 29 the book is available in the UC Davis Bookstore for $9.95.
