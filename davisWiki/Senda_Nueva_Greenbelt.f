This section of the The Greenbelt Davis Greenbelt connects to Perimeter Greenbelt Perimeter and Covell Greenbelt Covell Greenbelts.  It is located in North Davis in the Senda Nueva neighborhood.

One feature of the Senda Nueva Greenbelt is a piece of Town Art, a statue of The Dominoes giant dominoes.

Another feature is that it is made of concrete as opposed to the usual paved asphalt!  Users/StevenDaubert

There is also a more naturalized Greenbelt Secret Path alternative path to reach the Perimeter Greenbelt.
