The saying and the bumpersticker say: Practice Random Kindness And Senseless Acts Of Beauty

These are some of the Senseless Acts of Beauty in and around town:
  Asphalt Heart
  Angkor What
  Cheshire Cat Discharge  not currently present, but perhaps it will come back one day
  Lost Imagination
  The Chalkboard at 3rd and J
  Five Heart Topiary
  tollbooth

Some interesting finds, not exactly classified as above:
  Carousel Horse House
  The Starry Sidewalk around the shops on the 600 block of 2nd Street.  The effect is most pronounced at night around Samiras, and especially after having a few too many at any of the nearby bars.
  Spring Flowers
  Happiness Society

If you are looking for plain senseless acts, look at the Campus Crusade for Chaos and Confusion.  Some of these acts are arguably beautiful as well.

There is a smiley face painted on 5th street where the pull in for the bus stop is (towards First street). Picture request!

Not quite so planned, but serendipitous whimsy are the XCHUDX... errr... rather... Inanimate Objects with Amusing Faces.
