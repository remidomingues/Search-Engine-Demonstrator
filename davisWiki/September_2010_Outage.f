A major outage of Comcasts isp internet service in Davis occurred during September, 2010 and continuing into October.  During that time, many people tried to find out what was happening. One tech reported that the outage had started on the 9th of September.  On Wednesday the 29th, Users/DustyRags spoke to Comcast and was told that it was officially designated a partial node outage (meaning one node of a few hundred to a thousand people had a partial outage, which is hard to trace because its partial. It was designated as such since Monday, Sep. 27, already well into the problem.  A callback revealed that the main tap (the massive hardline into Davis) was overheating, and after replacing various parts they gave up and are now replacing the whole tap, which they said was a one day job.  For many people, the problems continued well into early October.  As of October 7th, they still had an automated Your area is part of a service interruption notice for callers.




the problem with this was hardware in sac that provides the fat pipes to Davis, it just quit working

if your comcast ever pings above 90ms you can tell there is a problem with the network, but be sure to check @ http://speedtest.comcast.net/

Notice

The following notice was placed at the top of the Comcast entry;









20100926 18:12:08 nbsp comcasts service is just terrible. when it works, its fine. but for the past 2 weeks, my internet and phone have continually gone out. i had a technician out 8 days ago, and he managed to make it work for an hour, when it crapped out again. i made another appt, only to have comcast call me to say they wont come out because the problem is with their network in davis. another week goes by, service stays bad, and i make an appt for yesterday. comcast calls again, says they wont come out, because the problem is with the network. but, they assure me, they will come out a day later. i wait today, they dont show up, and a call to comcast reveals that their system notes show that i cancelled the appt because i said my service was fine. of course, i never had such a conversation with comcast, so i have yet another appt for tomorrow. then i check my bill online, and discover that, adding insult to injury comcast charged me for the first service call. one of the many service technicians i spoke to blamed the problem on all the students moving in and activating service in september ... which is nonsense, considering that there are fewer students at the university this year due to budget cuts.

so dont count on comcast for reliable service. youll spend hours on the phone and your service will likely still suck. Users/tokai

  It makes no sense that there would be problems due to lots of students moving in.  New students move in every year.  They know this.  They had roughly the same number of students last year.  So both last year and this year, they should have had similar demands on their network.  One would hope that their network isnt so fragile that people actually using it wouldnt cause it to fail, but that seems to be what Comcast is implying.  On the other hand, Im not aware of their network failing last year.  Nor does it fail in all of the other college towns across the country that get sudden influxes of students whenever school starts.  So if they are giving you that explanation, dont believe them.  It makes no sense.  Or, if it actually is true, its a REALLY good argument not to use Comcast...   Users/IDoNotExist
   The new students are most likely not the cause of the problem, HOWEVER that doesnt mean they dont have anything to do with the problem. If equipment is failing in Davis (as it appears to be), and the capacity has dropped as a result, then all the new students most definitely could be causing the slowdown. There does appear to be issues with Comcast right now. Read the new outage notice above. Calling repair people will probably NOT help.  Users/GarrettGallegos
  Maybe Comcast has a new provisioning/billing software since last year that cant handle the load. They shouldnt blame that on the students though.  Users/NickSchmalenberger

20100927 14:28:49 nbsp If you are having connection issues, please read the outage notice at the top of the page before calling comcast. tThere is currently a citywide problem that has been going on for almost 2 weeks. Its probably a waste of your time and Comcasts time to get someone out to repair it.  Users/GarrettGallegos

20100928 13:18:44 nbsp according to the comcast tech who came to my home yesterday, they have been having problems in davis since the 9th, not the 17th. he said they were planning on installing a software update last night, between 123am, that hopefully would solve the problems. unfortunately, my modem reset itself twice just this morning. so, there is still no fix. at least the tech was honest and kind enough to admit that the claim that the number of students now in town was causing the problems was false.

comcast reps are on the UCD campus today, outside the MU, hawking their wares. i asked them if they were informing potential customers of their current inability to provide the service they are selling, and they claimed to be unaware of any problems in davis. they also said i was the first to tell them of any problems. yeah, right. if it werent 100+ degrees outside, id stand outside the comcast booth with a picket sign, warning students to stay away until comcast is actually able to provide the service they are selling. Users/tokai

  I wasnt sure what day it started, it seemed to start for me on the 17th, and of course I couldnt get them to admit there even was a problem at first. It was down for me for about 10 hours or more yesterday, coming back up for only a few minutes at a time. Thats by far the worst its been, maybe they were replacing equipment. Seems fine today (SO FAR), just waiting for it to fail  its that time of day (Consistently has failed for me around 1:30 pm). Software patch would be great if it worked, but one of the repair guys himself tried to act dumb about it  but them spilled the beans and told me there was a large piece of equipment that needed to get replaced, so at this point I dont think anyone  not even Comcast knows what is really wrong. I dont mind a bit of downtime here and there, but this is rediculous. For them to sell a service that is not even usable is robbery. I recommend you create a Twitter account and complain every hour.  Users/GarrettGallegos

20100928 21:38:08 nbsp I believe Comcast has fixed the problem, after being down for about 10 hours or more yesterday, it has been flawless today all day. I had fewer problems last TuesdayThursday, so it might not be the end of this. I will see how it goes through this coming weekend, and if all looks good next Monday (10/4) then I will remove the outage notice.Users/GarrettGallegos
  Alas not the case for me.  Been going in and out all evening.  What a mess. Users/OliviaY

20100929 11:17:18 nbsp I had a few short outages in midSeptember, in West Davis.  No more than about 5 minutes each time, and I think 34 times.  I havent had a problem in more than a week. Users/TomGarberson

20100929 11:22:03 UPDATE! I just talked to Comcast (10:45 Wednesday, 9/29), and they gave me the lowdown. First: this was officially designated a partial node outage (meaning one node of a few hundred to a thousand people had a partial outage, which is hard to trace because its partial. This has been designated as such since Monday, Sep. 27, already well into the problem. The guy said hed call me back after speaking to the team. Then he called me back and said the main tap (the massive hardline into Davis) was overheating, and after replacing various parts they gave up and are now replacing the whole tap. That should (hopefully) solve the problem. It should (his words) be a oneday job, but they dont know when theyll be finished yet and are careful not to give out exact times. Heres to hoping!Users/DustyRags

20100929 11:54:48 nbsp I havent noticed any particularly bad connection speeds or poor TV quality in N. Davis is this more of a SouthandCentral kind of thing? Users/JoePomidor
  Ditto, no problems out of the ordinary here (I live in North Davis). Users/hankim
   Northwest Davis here, been having trouble (connection comes and goes and is highly unstable) since the 9th. A technician came by and informed me that the problem was citywide and should be fixed next weekthis was 2 weeks ago. Users/Col

20100929 14:31:00 nbsp They called to let me know they fixed the problem yesterday.  service was good for about 3 hours but now my internet has been down almost all day (at least when I checked).  I am very angry at comcast, they clearly either lied or do not know what they are doing. Users/DagonJones
  When I had some trouble with my cable TV channels and they sent someone out, I had problems with my internet for the next 48 hours or so.  It eventually worked itself out, but from my experience, they tend to break things while trying to fix them.  Have you tried calling them again? Users/TomGarberson

20100929 14:55:01 nbsp Seriously Ive had really shitty and broken connection for almost the entire month. Shouldnt Comcast give us a free ride for our cable this month due to their incompetence?

As of 2:54 PM, Northwest Davis is still having connection issues. I think the longest time my connection remained stable was 30 min. Users/Col
  I believe you can track your outages and get your bill prorated.  I may be mixing them up with AT&T, but one of the two (maybe both) used to cut a days cost from the bill if you had outages.  You might look at the service contract; it probably provides for what happens in the event of outages. Users/TomGarberson

20100929 15:43:29 nbsp I think everyone should request a refund for this months bill. If Comcast refuses, cut & paste your balance into a Better Business Bureau complaint. I plan on getting free Comcast for the next year.  Users/KeithJose

20100929 19:54:06 nbsp I am amazed, this is my second day with uninterrupted internet (if we make it to midnight). Perhaps Comcast tracked down all my comments and tweets (yes, I went there) and pushed the make this guys internet work button on their backend. They obviously made some change, this is the most stable I have ever seen it in 3 years, even before this mess started it went out for a few seconds a couple times a day (I know because I get disconnected from everything whenever it drops). In all honesty, I dont care about getting a refund, the $30 credit isnt changing my life, but I work on the internet and the loss of internet has seriously affected me for the last few weeks. What I would like is for Comcast to actually admit when there is a problem, give a reasonable downtime estimate, and keep people aware of whats going on. I dont care if equipment fails, they can be honest about that. I may end up filing a BBB report because of their poor business practices, not their refunds or anything like that. Users/GarrettGallegos

20100929 19:55:39 nbsp PS: The only reason I tweeted was for them to hopefully fix this quicker. I was not a Twitterer before, nor will I be a Twitterer after this. I just noticed that some Comcast reps are on Twitter helping people here and there, so I figure it might at least get their attention. I recommend anyone still having issues get on Twitter, search for comcast davis and retweet every single one you see. Users/GarrettGallegos

20100929 20:04:14 nbsp Posting this during the few seconds that my internet actually works.  I just got off the phone with a Comcast tech support guy, and apparently theyve been receiving calls from the Davis area nonstop (lol).  According to the rep, they have people out here diligently working on the problem.  Estimated time of completion? Your guess is as good as mine.

SERIOUSLY considering switching to DSL. Users/Col

20100929 22:40:56 nbsp Ive been logging my connections through Comcast to various point on the web. Starting with my router, then the cable modem, Comcast gateways (which I try and catch whenever my IP changes) and so on. Things started to get really bad around the 26th of September. Like most of the other customers whove posted, I call whenever there is an issue and have had four techs out to date. Ive had no problems with my TV just internet.

Here are some logs from my modem.

20100930 19:44:59 nbsp Still having issues in East Davis.

Corp. America like Comcast, the $ is the bottom line, they dont give a rats ass about admitting to any failure or fessing to any issue. The books at the end of the quarter are what count to the success of Comcast, and thats what speaks to the people that have any care to what you receive in services. The best thing people can do is make this as expensive as possible for Comcast. Demand a refund for the full month, in addition, please submit a BBB report, demanding a full refund, or the difference of what Comcast may have refunded you vs your month balance. Home visits are also expensive for Comcast, so please demand they come out for some mouth breather to say yep, modem is fine.

If Comcast were at all concerned about the quality of product they delivered, the certainly have the money to do it. I know if I let the data center I manage to fail for 2 minutes I would be failing at my job. High availability is not difficult for a company like Comcast who has a large infrastructure and budget. Users/KeithJose
  Wow, man! Did you ever think the Comcast workers are professionals like yourself? The term mouth breather really shows a lack of respect. I think your complaints about the corporate structure of Comcast are reasonable, but dont take it out on the workers. Write to the Telecommunications Commission or go to a meeting and hopefully they will take it into consideration when the franchise agreement is renewed. Users/NickSchmalenberger
  The best thing people can do is make this as expensive as possible for Comcast. Ummmm, thats not Comcasts money  thats OUR money, If you want to make the prices go up and unless you want to pay more and more to Comcast  then by all means keep getting the repair guys out. Refunds wont affect Comcasts bottom line, its more expensive for 1 repair person to come out than you pay in a month. PS: Repair guys are not Comcast robots, calling them out over, and over, and over is not going to help  show them some respect  they must be miserable right now  going to every home for 10 minutes just to say your connection is fine, there is an outage. The best thing you can do is file a BBB report. Users/GarrettGallegos

20101001 03:35:55 nbsp Sorry gang, it has absolutely nothing to do with the amount of downloads, torrents, etc. and everything to do with outdated and degrading equipment. A little bit of incompetence and lack of communication within the hierarchy of Comcast as well, perhaps, but the majority of the issues had everything to do with the Internet/cable taps and hubs degrading and nothing more. As much as we all seem to hate bandwidth whores, it is not their problem this time.  Users/WesP
  WesP, first of all noone said it was the fault of torrenters (idea is to reduce load to minimize problems). They are still sucking up tons of network bandwidth, and you cannot just discount them as having nothing to do with the situation whatsoever. They are not the CAUSE, but that doesnt mean its unrelated. If there are two lanes of traffic in and out of Davis, and one lane is shut down, then traffic is bad even though it isnt the fault of that traffic  its the road closure, so reducing traffic would still help. Considering there are already massive connection problems, its most definitely not helping the situation. Its obviously not the cause, HOWEVER if Comcasts bandwidth capacity is reduced for the entire town, it definitely could help to reduce torrent traffic to ease it up for the rest of the town  allowing all that extra traffic to be routed elsewhere. I dont know what the problem is, nor do you, nor does anyone else apparently, and this request was a matter of RESPECT AND an attempt to ease up on the network for the better good of the rest of the Comcast users who cant get online at all. Personally, most of my connection problems were at peak usage times, and this started just as students were moving into town (which I do not think is a coincidence) so even if reducing torrents wont solve it, I think it will help, and even if it doesnt help, its worth a try. Its not like we are banning torrent traffic, we are kindly asking people to reduce their usage. Users/GarrettGallegos
   These issues are not the type youd see because of excess bandwidth utilization or the swarm of connections you get with BitTorrent.  Users/WilliamLewis
    Unless you work for Comcast stop acting like you know what the problem is  you arent psychic. This is complete nonsense....  How do you know that? And explain why most problems are occurring at peak times if its such nonsense. I am actually trying to help the problem, you are just complaining about some text on this page, and acting like a knowitall. Do you have any concept of maybe it will help, maybe it wont, but its worth a shot? Im no networking expert, and Ive been humble in saying I dont know if it will help but maybe it will. Maybe you should ask all the people whose internet is actually down if it might possibly be worth a shot? Micronetworks at home can be a pain, let alone huge networks with 1000s of users. At no point do I say torrents are the cause of the issue, and if you think about it it can definitely be a hinderance. The bottom line here is capacity is reduced  this much we already know. Unless you are from Comcast, you have no idea what the problem is. I have been very clear that I do not know what the problem is, and that this torrent thing is to minimize load on the network so traffic can actually be routed through working equipment, if the working equipment is maxed out, then the traffic cant be rerouted through the working equipment, can it? If Im wrong, thats totally fine, Im wrong all the time  and Im totally secure with that  Ive been clear about not being sure it will help, but reducing torrent traffic cant hurt anything at all  it can either help or do nothing at all, and if it does nothing at all, then at least we tried. All of my problems have been at peak times, so go ahead and explain that if you are so sure if it. Users/GarrettGallegos
     The symptoms very strongly point to a layer 2 problem in the hybrid fibercoax portion of the network. Responses from Comcast that people have posted here and elsewhere seem to confirm this theory. Holding back on the torrenting wouldnt solve such a problem. Sure, your suggestion doesnt do any harm, but there is very little basis to make it. Users/WilliamLewis
      Haha, yes, little basis except for the whole peak usage thing. I dont pretend to know more than I actually know about this. You cant try to solve large network problems based on wiki comments, and you seem to think youre a network expert like everyone else in Davis, yada yada yada I hear it all the time. Unless you are 100.000% sure its not going to help, which not even Comcast is, please leave the outage notice intact for now  its the only hope for people actually experiencing problems. Users/GarrettGallegos
      Garrett you are coming across a bit know it allish as well....  Odds are peak hours are when most people are noticing it (for obvious reasons) but it is/was definitely also happening at: 12am, 1am, 2am, 3am...6am, 7am and other odds and ends times when Im awake with my insomnia.  So yeah most people are going to have problems during peak hours because most people are on at that time in the first place!  Ive had problems with pretty much any time of the day for the last 2 weeks.Users/OliviaY
      Olivia, sorry if you think i sound like a knowitall, my intent is only to be humble. Ive tried to say Im not sure, I never said this is true or this is not true as some others users on here sound so confident, and I am only trying to get this problem solved, nothing more. Anything I am sure of is only my own personal experience. I have heard form a few users that it is mostly at peak times, and I have heard the opposite from a couple of other users (not many). I can only base this on my own experiences, which is just that  peak times. As a web developer I am online all the time  all day long. From the time this problem started, I have been pinging google or other sites almost the entire time, watching for outages. Its not just when I notice it, because I leave the ping open on my extra screen all day. Only on 1 day did it go out outside of peak times, that was Monday when it was out for 10 hours, and after that its been perfect, so that evidence seems to point to an equipment replacement on Monday, prior to that peak time outages can be explained by what ive said previously. It was going out the same time of day like clockwork for about 2 weeks, prior to that I have never had a problem during peakusage times. It seems not all of the equipment has been fixed since users are still having problems, but they sure made some change on Monday. Users/GarrettGallegos
        Have you looked into being appointed to the Telecommunications Commission? I really dont think this problem will get solved on the wiki. If you have contact info for a Comcast technician, maybe you could offer to buy them a beer after work and they could tell you what the real story is. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20101001 13:26:57 nbsp Wow, its nice to see that DavisWiki recognizes the outage. So I was getting pretty pissed off with the internet randomly dropping for the last few weeks, and every CSR i talked to gave me different reasons until one guy admitted that theres an outage in the area. I managed to get them to give me a credit towards my account, since we havent been able to use the internet more than half the time. Its worked fine since yesterday(9/30) for me, save a few brief disconnections... Lets hope the problem is gone for good. Users/susiekim

20101005 19:36:45 nbsp I see the post above about no interruptions but I am still experiencing serious packet loss/slow speeds. At this time my internets probably slower than when I used to have DSL. Its getting pretty ridiculous. Are there any other cable internet options in Davis besides Comcast or Infinity or whatever theyre calling themselves? Ive had enough. Users/JSingh
  Dont know about other options, I would worry that anything cablebased might be using the same backbone as Comcast, in other words I just wouldnt sign up for anyone else before asking a few people who have that carrier. PS  I have to say this: I bet a reduction in torrent usage by people in Davis who want to be respectful of others would help this problem. Users/GarrettGallegos
   Even assuming youre right that some people reducing their torrenting would make things faster for others, its not clear to me that we ought to do it.  If we (the members of the Davis community) reduce our internet usage to the point where the problem is minimized, then Comcast has no incentive to fix it and were all stuck limiting our usage, even though we pay for larger usage.   Users/CovertProfessor
    Honestly, even as a former torrenter, I dont understand why people think that Comcast should have to fix the bandwidth problem. If the internet is up, and not really slow, Im just find and dandy with that. Torrents have only been around for a few years, if they hadnt become such a fad, Comcasts normal improvements to their system over time would be more than enough to handle any amount of changes to Internet traffic. Comcast shouldnt have to upgrade all of their equipment just because one fad comes along, as a company they have to be realistic, and plan for gradual changes and upgrades to their networks over time, which on average would increase their capacity by some small % every year. Comcast never said hey people, come torrent as much as you want  itll be way fast. Its just another unrealistic expectation. Id be fine with them capping the crap out of heavy users, which really has nothing to do with net neutrality as some people think (not that you mentioned this term, but I am sure some nerds who read this will think about that), that is a term people like to throw around all the time to try to get their way but the actual definition can be vague and can vary a lot, and has more to do with the content being served rather than the bandwidth (content is subjective, bandwidth is physically limited). PS: You arent really paying for larger usage, you are paying for the possibility of larger usage. In other words, they dont guarantee youre going to get those speeds. PSS: I think its funny that you put the blame and responsibility on Comcast, who is not source of the problem (well, not this particular problem) nor are they the ones who can make a difference in the shortterm, rather than blaming those people who are causing the problem and who can actually make a difference in the shortterm. Think of how many upgrades Comcast has made, you cant expect them to just max everything out all the time with the best equipment. Do you buy the newest, fastest computer every year, with the absolute maximum specs? Probably not, and most people would like their midrange equipment to last 34 years or more. Businesses operate the same way. Im actually defending Comcast for once (I am even surprised at this), because it just doesnt make sense to make unrealistic expectations. Having the internet work consistently is a realistic expectation. Having it be as fast as possible all the time, not so realistic. Do you expect the freeways to always be going 65mph? No. Do you go 65mph even when there is tons of traffic? No. What youre talking about is essentially roadrange of the Internet. Im sure if everyone would like to pay $1000/mo or more for internet, them Comcast would be more than happy to upgrade everything and get the best equipment in place every year, but as long as they are taking our measly $40 or $50 on average, they can only afford so much equipment, and so many people to go out and install it. Im curious to see how the Wiki Trolls will respond to this, but Ill try my best to leave it alone from here on out  on this comment anyway. Users/GarrettGallegos

20101006 20:44:41 nbsp The drop in internet quality I have noticed over the past several years occurred in September. Seemed to me it must have been the influx of users this year, noticed it for a short time (day or two) then back to normal. Users/RichardL

20101007 15:57:00 nbsp This is my last quarter in Davis and I will be glad to never have to deal with comcast ever again! Theyre super expensive and the connection is sht! My apartment originally came with the slow free internet connection, but I couldnt keep using that because Im a gamer and my latency would be past 2k and you cant do ANYTHING with a latency that high. After I got comcast, things were fine for the first few months but for the past month and a half my connection would just go out randomly.

Ive called in numerous times and theyve even got an automated message saying something like Your area is part of a service interruption, you do not need to call in about this. Basically, an automated way of saying f off, we dont care! Come on. The frequent disconnecting is frustrating, especially if youre doing something ingame that requires a stable connection.  Users/Blaine

20101007 17:48:18 nbsp Apparently the credit issue has been solved by Comcast. A large portion of users have used the I want to disconnect trick a few too many times so that now they are hesitant to credit even the worst case scenarios. In my case, 3.5 years of overpayment for services I was not able to receive due to a filter on the line that should not have been there to begin with was reduced to 2 months of free service and 6 months of free HBO, Starz and Encore.  Big freaking deal. I overpaid to a tune of 987.50 according to their numbers so they give me approximately 300.00 in credit to my account with this program lineup and the two months credit.. God I hate Comcast. Users/WesP
 See?  Comcast is all about customer service and making people happy!  Glad theyve got another satisfied customer. Users/ComcastBob
   Are you insane?  I would not classify myself as satisfied by a far cry.  3.5 years of overpayment becomes two months of credit plus a bunch of channels I will never watch. Yippee.

  Ive got the upgraded/outdated service where I get 22 megabits or something like that, but Im still only getting 11 megabits on a good day.  A lot of times, Ill completely lose service or get dropped several times for almost three hours, which really pisses me off when Im trying to game on XBL.  It has been like this since the beginning of September.
Friends in East Davis has been reporting terrible internet all month, it was down today. Other friends TV in South Davis froze yesterday... Daubert

20101019 22:19:21 nbsp Is anyone still experiencing problems? My internet has been unreliable all last and this month so far, but I didnt realize it was an outage until I saw this page yesterday. I thought I mightve set up my router all funny, but maybe not.... Or maybe it is the router... I dont know. Im in West Davis. Users/JenniferGiang

20101019 22:22:22 nbsp My internets still unreliable. On a good day, it cuts out and comes back on once or twice an hour. Should say Im in East Davis. Users/HarrisonM

20101024 12:13:14 nbsp Yes, this is ridiculous. Weve had onandoff internet since September, and are still experiencing it now. Sometimes we have a good day, sometimes we are forced to use the Apartments alternate provider for complete lack of connection. (Woops, and Im in West Davis)  Users/AshleyMatson

20101024 21:47:38 nbsp I dont feel that I should have to pay for my internet bill this month when its been totally useless and Im essentially paying Comcast for nothing. If theyre going to interrupt my service they should interrupt my bill as well. Is there anything I can do to get a refund or a price reduction? Anyone have any luck with that? Users/OrofinJackson

20101026 23:33:13 nbsp well after 3 weeks of smooth sailing, im getting random disconnects again tonight. Users/mchew

20101102 13:30:07 nbsp Was still having problems through today.  Just got my (rental) modem replaced.  Had to go down to the Research park Comcast center to get it. Hopefuly this fixes the problem.  I got a $30 credit, but considering my internet has been practically unusable for more than a month, I would have thought they could give me at least a months fee off. Users/trkerbavaz

20101118 23:19:44 nbsp Still experiencing Comcast fail. Just thought Id update :) Users/AshleyMatson Users/AshleyMatson

20110106 08:45:37 nbsp Is anyone experiencing a January Outage? Users/Col

20110115 14:19:21 nbsp Aaaaaaand were out again! Joy! Users/AshleyMatson

20110606 19:15:30 nbsp I just got off of an hour long conversation with Comcast. They had me run the normal unplug your modem, take out your router, etc. and then after an hour of insisting that I received the automated message on the support line saying that there was an outage in my area, suddenly, Sir, we just received notice that there is an hour in your area. A partial node outage. So there you go  a new AREA WIDE OUTAGE FROM COMCAST. Users/NicholasBarbulesco
 Still working for me.   Users/CovertProfessor

20110606 21:19:29 nbsp Experiencing the same outage that NicholasBarbulesco is remarking on. Glad to know its at least known, Comcast went blue in the face telling me there were no reports of outages in davis. Users/Oceaniax
 Same problem here, and if Facebook is any indicator, a lot of people in town are having the problem. Users/TomGarberson
  Not an outage, but the internet in my household was REALLLY slow and groggy. Left to go study at the school instead. Users/ClarenceL

20110612 19:58:52 nbsp Internet was down for several hours in the afternoon both today and yesterday, interspersed with short periods of superslow connectivity. Quite ridiculous. Users/DianaSmith

20110613 00:37:06 nbsp In Davis, you can either choose from AT&Ts expensive, yet very reliable and fast Internet, or you can choose Comcasts pretty cheap and somewhat non reliable Internet, or you can just use wifi from everyother place in Davis.  Users/NikhilDahal
