20100714 14:31:44 nbsp managment goes on here and edits any complaints about themselves, there is no point in posting,this company is trash and located far from the property they just dont care as long as they get that $ from students who have no choice and are glad that we can find a place to live. a few of us from different properties have now formed a tenant group and will be distributing flyers on campus and other areas so everyone is aware of how bad it is at sharps and flats and tanglewood.

  Truth be told, if the management does edit comments, they will be repaired in short order to their original state, minus any personal attacks of course. WesP
  TruthI checked the pages of Sharps & Flats and Tanglewood and I see no current evidence that editing of complaints has occured. If you see any and want to point them out, you have my personal word it will be addressed.  PeteB
