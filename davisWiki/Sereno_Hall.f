Sereno Hall is located in the Regan Residence Halls Regan dorms.  It is the Music, Arts, and Performance Themed Dorm, or just simply the Music Dorm. Some also call it the Sereno Insane Asylum.  Its a rockin place even if the facilities themselves are really old and kind of poor.  Its a small dorm housing around 50 individuals which makes for a closeknit environment with a strong sense of camaraderie. The building is bordered by Regan Hall Circle on its back side and Talara Hall on its front. Sereno is also where the Raisin Question originatedfor weeks Raisin Philosophers debated whether raisins are indeed food or not. The Sereno Hotties were formed here. There is a facebook group devoted to Sereno class of 0304 @http://ucdavis.facebook.com/group_profile.php?gid678 this address and the Sereno Hotties @ http://ucdavis.facebook.com/group_profile.php?gid927 this link. Users/AnnelieseGuess is the Resident Advisor in Sereno for 0607.



As a graduate of Sereno I credit most of my lifes accomplishments to the hours spent running crazy through these halls.  Sereno 0304 was a good year.  Sereno for LIFE!!!!  Users/TimOldenkamp

As a periodic presence in Sereno, I can attest that, certainly, Sereno is responsible for most of Users/TimOldenkamp Mr. Oldenkamps behavior, but I do not believe that any one source can account for the full personality with which he presents us.  Users/ChristopherCondap

I was a resident of Sereno Hall from 19921995 and was RA of the hall in the 9495 academic year.  I have many fond memories of Sereno and the communities I lived and worked with.  I often wonder if the muticolor paint job I gave the sign out front ever got painted over.  I hope not.    Users/NoahApodaca
