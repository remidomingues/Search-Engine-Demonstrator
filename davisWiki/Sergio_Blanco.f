 Candidate Statement  2010 Presidential Campaign 

Hi fellow Aggies, our names are Sergio Blanco and Vishakha Patel and we are running for ASUCD President and Vice President. We decided to take on this task to ensure that your student government has the strong leaders that all undergraduates deserve. Our experiences as community organizers taught us to put peers first and politics second. For example, we both have worked with community outreach programs such Upward Bound and Education Opportunity program that taught us the importance of higher education across various socioeconomic levels and communities. Also our previous participation in student government allows us to understand the various issues that affect students throughout campus. Because of these experiences we came up with a platform that prioritizes improvement of student life at UC Davis. If elected we are determined to invest money in the Learning Skills Center (LSC) to ensure the creation of more tutoring positions which in return will create jobs for students and tutoring resources for those students seeking academic help. In addition to improving the academic resources, we also want to reduce daily parking permit prices and keep lecture halls open longer during the week of finals. These policies would provide students with a safe environment where they can study and concentrate for final exams. Furthermore, we want to reduce the financial impact of attending the university by having assigned class readers on their designated course pages. In addition to these policies we also seek to fight for student groups by providing them with an ASUCD program that would seek to alleviate the burdens of the high initial costs of fund raising. Furthermore to reduce the costs of advertisement for student groups we deem necessary to purchase a flier machine to ensure that student groups pay less than a market price for their fliers. Finally and most importantly, we need to prioritize students over administration. We will do this, locally by ensuring that the Davis Student Coop remains a resource for students on campus. At the university level, we will fight to establish reform within the administration, NO MORE FEE INCREASES TO PAY FOR SALARY BONUSES. If you want qualified candidates that care about their peers and the education that we deserve and pay for, vote for us #1!

 Official Statement  2008 Senate Campaign
Hello fellow Ags! My name is Sergio Blanco. I am a second year Political Science major, and I am running for ASUCD Senate. For the past year I have been involved with L.E.A.D. as an intern for current Senator and Presidential candidate Ivan Carrillo. In my time as an intern I have helped with the writing and passage of an ASUCD Senate Resolution that encouraged the expansion of the foreign language program at UC Davis. Furthermore, I have organized events that raise awareness about the declining diversity on campus and our rising tuition fees. As a Senator, I will work to raise awareness about ways to pay for college and improve our campus life.

In order to raise knowledge of financial aid resources, I will work with the Student Recruitment Retention Center, Educational Opportunity Program, ASUCD unit Pathfinder, and the financial aid office so that we can better educate current and potential students about ways to finance their education. There are financial resources available that students are not aware of, and the more educated we are about these resources; the less students have to worry about paying for school.

I will also enhance campus life for all students by promoting free and open events, such as a Battle of the Bands. In order to achieve this goal I will work with different campus clubs and organizations. These entertainment options will not only bring more excitement to campus but they will also encourage students to engage in the campus community.

Please join my fight for a less stressful and more entertaining college experience by voting Sergio Blanco #1 for ASUCD Senate. Thank you for your time.
