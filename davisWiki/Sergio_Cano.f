 Executive Candidate Statement 

WHAT’S UP, UC Davis. We are Paul Min and Sergio Cano, and we’re running to be your next ASUCD President and Vice President! Paul is a junior Philosophy major, current ASUCD Senator and a member of Mustard Seed Ministry. Sergio is a senior Mathematics and Economics double major and the current Chair of the ASUCD Internal Affairs Commission, former Chair of the Renters’ Rights Committee and the Elections Committee, and a former CoHo employee.

Our campaign is simple: initiate projects with a lasting impact that improve the quality of student life on campus. We are running because we believe student government is capable of making far more positive change in student lives than it has under the previous administration. You deserve a student government that represents the entire campus and presents innovative ways to move forward.

Our top priorities will be to enhance the campus through

FIRST AID STATIONS
I’m sure we’ve all experienced seeing students get injured in bike accidents across campus. We believe students should have easier access to bandages or antiseptic without needing to walk all the way to the Student Health Center.

GET MORE C PERMIT PARKING SPOTS ON CAMPUS
How often do you see A permit parking spots vacant when all the C spots are taken? If you’re paying $500 dollars a year, you should have an easier time finding parking on campus.

GET VENDING MACHINES IN THE 24 STUDY ROOM AND MORE TEST SUPPLY VENDING MACHINES AROUND CAMPUS
We will work with the library to put vending machines in the 24 study room with proceeds going back towards the ASUCD SCHOLARSHIP. Additionally, we will work with the Bookstore to install more test supply vending machines in highly populated areas such as SciLec, Giedt, and Wellman.

INTERNET CAFE/ENTERTAINMENT VENUE IN THE MU
An MU remodel is imminent and there are preliminary plans to remove the Griffin Lounge. We want to ensure spaces exists for students to study during the day and that are versatile for student organizations to use for events throughout the school year.  We believe UC Davis students need leaders who are engaged in this campus.
