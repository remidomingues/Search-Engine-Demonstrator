Services for International Students & Scholars (SISS) is a campus unit providing services to campus international community. A major aspect of their role is assisting international students and scholars with http://siss.ucdavis.edu/visa_immigration.htm visa and immigration issues  in addition to preparing visa documents, SISS helps international students and scholars maintain their legal status while in the United States. SISS also provides orientation, assistance, information and referrals regarding financial, personal, cultural, and academic concerns. To help international students/scholars get settled in Davis, establish community connections and keep abreast of immigration issues, SISS maintains two http://siss.ucdavis.edu/listserv.cfm?idstudent list servers.

 Help SISS Find Our Stolen Banner 

On Tuesday February 6th, the welcome banner (pictured below) was stolen from Services for International Students and Scholars. The banner served to welcome international students and scholars to the Davis community in many languages. The theft of the banner is not only a crime, but it is sad message to send to our international community members. Any information that you can provide about this matter will be greatly appreciated.  The banner is 3’x 5’
