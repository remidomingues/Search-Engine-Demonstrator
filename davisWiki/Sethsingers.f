Sethsingers is a group of UC Davis alumni who sang in the University Chorus at various points during the years 1994 through 2008. The group returns to Davis each year for the UCD Chorus Alumni Weekend, during which the alumni rehearse and then perform in a concert with the current chorus.

Sethsingers was formed ahead of the second Alumni Chorus reunion  the March 2004 performance of Verdis Requiem.  On October 27, 2003 Seth sent out an email to 8 fellow alumni, inquiring as to who would attend the upcoming reunion and what their plans for the weekend were.  Enthusiastic responses followed, often with additional alumni added to the recipient list.  Unfortunately, the recipient lists became increasingly chaotic as people nonchalantly responded to older emails that had incomplete recipient lists, while at the same time, adding additional (new) recipients.  NoCa^2+^ grew weary of trying to maintain this recipient list (see herding cats), and on November 5, 2003 created a Yahoo! Group to manage the de facto mailing list.  The group was named Sethsingers  The Singing Friends of Seth to pay homage to Seths initiative and inclusive attitude.  As of February 2009, Sethsingers has 31 subscribers.

Sethsingers have a special relationship with conductor Jeffrey Thomas, as many of the group were part of his first class during his initial year at UC Davis (academic year 19961997).

Sethsingers tend to frequent such local establishments as Sophias Thai Kitchen Sophias, Woodstocks Pizza Woodstocks, and Caffe Italia when they converge on Davis. They hold an informal convocation ceremony in the Arboretum each year.
