20070319 22:57:55 nbsp I am thinkng of living here, could anyone post what type of noise you hear through the walls? Tvs, voices, cabinents, ect? Anyone lived here recently that can comment? Thanx! HeatherMelton

20070509 16:52:39 nbsp Nice place. Great management! Users/AggieAlum

20070617 18:18:09 nbsp I agree. No crazy parties to speak of. Generally responsible tenants, though many would benefit from an extensive training course in recycling/waste flow. I frequently have to fish loads of paper and recyclables out of the dumpsters (huge cardboard boxes, bags full of empty soda cans and bottles). Theres also a dearth of awareness about what constitutes acceptable trash and what needs to be taken to the landfill (old office chairs, tvs, ewaste, etc.). As for management, the onsite folks are okay. They tend to be busy, but responsive when you can get ahold of them. Office hours kept are not exactly those that are posted. WARNING: The fire alarms in these places are the kind that are plugged into the ceiling, but which also take a backup battery. If the battery goes out, the things will chirp at you endlessly. Figuring out how to shut them up is no easy task.   Users/ajsikes

20070808 23:15:49 nbsp To address the concerns about noise from neighbors, I could occasionally hear banging (from what I assume was someone hanging pictures), tv, and voices. Not too bad, though. I never really had a problem with that kind of stuff. On occasion neighbors/roommates lovemaking was way too loud to study or sleep (not quite sure if that is thin walls, loud sex, or a combination of the two). Upsides: I played music, sometimes pretty loud, and no one ever complained. Most things worked and management was responsive when we had problems. Downsides: Rodents (we had a problem as they managed to crawl under our door during the rainy season). You are in the middle of nowhere. It is expensive. We worked our asses off cleaning/scrubing/washing the apartment thoroughly and barely got any of our deposit back. Users/SeanJohannessen

20071004 11:56:14 nbsp I really like this place for people who are professionals and/or do not go to UCD.  They were built to be condos but apparently the Davis City Council said no and they have to be apartments for 5 years.  They are new, clean, nice, and 3 miles away from downtown Davis which is just far enough to avoid typical college apartment problems.  Its a short bike ride down 2nd or 5th Street to get in to town and right across the street from a big park.  Close to Nuggets (on the other side of the freeway on Mace), Konditorei (1.25 miles), Toad Hollow Dog Park (2.25 miles), and Sudwerk (2.25 miles). Users/Judge
  This explains a lot. They really are like houses when youre inside, even though theyre called apartments. Many (all?) of them have attached garages too. Users/JeremyOgul

20071010 13:26:39 nbsp I recently stayed for 10 days as  my daughter/soninlaws guest at the Seville, and the management could not have been nicer.  I dropped a contact lens (my fault) down a drain in the guest bath, and the handy man came over 20 minutes after I
reported the loss and found it.  He was courteous and efficient.  The grounds were well maintained and in general, I found it
a fine living arrangement. AnnG Users/angieg

20071220 12:08:13 nbsp CLEAN, QUIET, MORE LIKE A RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITY THAN APARTMENTS... FAMILY LIVING Users/kennedy

20080218 16:59:02 nbsp Going to add another commentwhen I first moved here it seemed to take a while for the handyman to come outthen again, everyone had just signed new leases so there were probably a lot of issues.  NowI call because my lock was broken and the handyman came out the same day.  He fixed the lock, the screen door off the slider, and was very sweet to my dog which was good to know in case he needs to come in when I am not here. Users/Judge

20080306 20:08:20 nbsp rat Fest!
This is the worst apartment complex ever. Theres rats running around all over the apartment complex. They keep saying they are going 2 resolve the problem, but they never do. Management is horrible. They never fix anything. My shower was clogged over a month. They lie and change everything around. They are never in the office. Even if you leave a voice mail, Jana (the worst manager) will never respond. Users/ocean

20080418 18:30:25 nbsp Were there really rat problems or was it just a bad experience? Users/Megan579

20080614 22:59:17 nbsp What exactly is the pet policy here? Are dogs allowed? If yes, what about weight limits/breed restrictions? Users/belinda364

20080703 13:38:52 nbsp The actual apartment is very nice.  Compared to other places ive seen in davis, its one of the nicest places to live here.  The management is terrible though.  The office is closed at random times and it is almost impossible to get a package.  I had a problem with my blinds; someone came out right away to look at it, but never did anything about it.  If you dont need to deal with the management, its an awesome place to live. Users/vic

20080703 18:57:35 nbsp The reason we are not renewing a lease is due to the apartment manager, Jana. She is a horrible manager AND a not too great person. As the year progressed she seemed to be in the office less and less during the posted hours, with no indication as to when she would return. The one time she was there at the beginning of the year  I reminded her our DW was broken and she yelled at the handyman and said he forgot to replace it –even though she was aware she never wrote it on the work order. She is rude, and never returns my smiles or hellos when I see her OUTSIDE the office. She creates a negative living atmosphere that luckily for the complex is offset by the wonderful handymen. The two handymen have always been friendly and quick to fix things when they get the orders.

OVERALL: Okay place to live: nice pool, good storage in garage, but very difficult to get packages or anything else from the office. I think it would be a great place to live if it was better managed, oh, and if you don’t mind the occasional mouse, which should be expected since there are fields surrounding the complex.

20081029 09:28:27 nbsp First gripe:  Dishonest with security deposit reimbursement.  Lived in apartment for ~2 years, treated it well, no damage done to the apartment.  Did moveout walkthrough with the worthless Janna at the rental officeshe assured us that wed get our entire deposit back, and marked down that the apartment was clean with no damage, but when we got the security deposit back from St. Antonthe manager of the propertya month later, we were deducted over half of our deposit for cleaning charges, stating beyond normal wear and tear which was definitely not the case since it was just as clean as when we moved in.  The suspicious thing was that the cleaning company hired to do the cleaning (a 3rd party hire) decides whether the apartment is in need of more cleaning beyond normal wear and tearconflict of interest much?

Second gripe:  When living there, Janna, the rental office manager, was NEVER around.  Getting packages was problematic at best.  Maintenance was slowly taken care of by the office, and typically was only halfdone by the workers.

Third gripe:  At the end of our second lease year when given renewal papers, the amount of the rent increase was marked on the new lease as the normal APR interest by local banks, and was listed on the lease as 1.5% APR.  After checking with the local banks, the HIGHEST APR by any bank was 0.43%not a huge deal, but just shows how they dishonestly manage some things.

Pricey but nice alternative to busier and noisier apartment complexes.  Its definitely a pleasant place to live and they have nice units, albeit far away from most things in Davis, but if you do decide to live here, just kiss your security deposit goodbye when you sign the lease and dont expect to see any of it regardless of how well you treat the apartment. Users/chicodegallo

20090512 We have been living at these apartments for some time. There was a manager before Janna who was extremely efficient but unusually rude. When we came, the apartments had a very bad mice infestation and although it took some time to get the mice away (in large part by our own measures), the problem was addressed promptly. Then someone complained about that manager being rude, and we got Janna, who is not only rude, but quite incompetent. It is true that she is never at the office during office hours. Furthermore, I have the impression that the only apartment that gets worked on in a regular manner is hers, while the swimming pool, jacuzzy and outide appearance of the complex deteriorates. Should you have a plumbing or different problem after hours, you are on your own, as there is no way that you can get a hold of anyone if you have ANY sort of emergency related to the apartment. I think these units are an ok place to live, but frankly, they are not worth the money. I would not rent at this place if I knew what I know now. Users/Eckhardt

20090721 20:46:31 nbsp I lived in this complex for some time and Ill have to say that its by far the best apartment complex Ive lived in for a great price.  Unlike the negative comments I read, my experience is quite the opposite.  Janna was always available, was always accomodating and very HELPFUL.  I would say that shes probably the best Apartment manager Ive ever worked with.  Any maintenance issue I had would either get fixed within the hour or within the same day.  When we first started looking for places around Davis, we saw quite a few and Seville was the last place we saw.  We met with Janna to look at a 2BR.  Compared to other managers we met with, she was the most professional one.  LA       Users/leahambrosio

20100120 20:07:24 nbsp I have lived in the Seville for 3 years now in a 2x2 above the garages and i think this is an awesome place to live. Whats great about this complex is the value for the price. You get a garage(great for protecting expensive cars), washer/dryer, close freeway access, and a pet/family friendly environment. It is also a 5 minute walk to the new Target. For around $700 in rent, what more could you ask for? I have had zero problems with my apartment and perhaps i have been lucky. For the amenities you get, this has to be one of the best valued apartments in Davis.

However, if you are a student, you may find it to be quite far away. However, since the freeway is so close, it takes about 5 minutes to get to campus. I also find the A line to actually be one of the worst bus lines out there simply because it comes twice an hour and has to cover about 10 miles of total distance (also drives through the downtown area). If you get on the bus at the Seville stop, it may take you about 20 minutes to get to campus. Users/kkbmlb5

20100420 18:35:15 nbsp @ kkbmlb5: This sure does look like a wonderful complex, but how did you manage to get a ~$700 rate for a 2 bedroom?? Users/Blaine

20100713 18:06:24 nbsp I will arrive in Seville on 16th of August. I have a question. I want very high speed internet. Comcast or At&t DSL(Uverse)?    Users/spomed


20110806 14:20:43 nbsp I agree with everything  chicodegallo states in their view of the apartments. Literally everything he/she put down happened to me, including the security deposit. Not only will you not get it back, they will send you a bill. Know your rights and dont let shady people like this control you! People like these who take advantage of others like this make me sick. I strongly urge you to seek other places to live; you can find a nice house in Davis for about the same price of one of their poorly managed apartments.

The walls are thin so you can hear your neighbor upstairs at all times.
Comcast is good for the area
Janna (the manager) is NEVER in her office during office hours.
You wont get your deposit back. Users/BenKappler

20120223 13:36:53 nbsp I lived in these apartments from 20052007 and everything people are saying about the deposit (not getting a cent of it back) is true. I kept the apartment immaculate and ended up getting a bill that said above normal wear and tear. Sadly, I read reviews and people were already complaining about not getting deposits back and I ignored them. They are nice apartments and do not hear much noise at all, but too expensive, not to mention shady management. I was there before Jana and stayed for not long after she started. She was never in the office from the very begining and there were always ghetto looking people hanging out at her apartment. Users/christigiang

20121219 23:54:44 nbsp I can testify that it is a really nice apartment complex. A little pricey though. We have a space that we need to occupy so if anyone is interested in living here, shoot me an email! (dont worry, i wont treat your email as spam) spammers.get.this.email@gmail

20130703 17:06:05 nbsp Not a good place for families with kids. No speed limit is posted inside. Speeding cars are coming in.

Outsiders and the Managers boyfriends are drinking inside the common pool area and sauna. You will see used condoms left near the pool.

Last month there were robbery inside the complex. Not a safe place because of very easy access to highway 80 which may be an escape route for the robbers.
My familys bicycles were stolen four times in last one year.
