20110616 23:21:47 nbsp I recently hit up sew many things to get my zipper of my leather jacket repaired. It was done in a day for dirt cheap and Im sure to recommend them to my friends! Users/StevenDaubert

20110617 10:06:24 nbsp Aaaaahhhhhh they are able to repair zippers on jackets/hoodies?? I had this hoodie that I really liked and the zipper broke off. Said hoodie is now somewhere I dont know :(
But I will have to check out this shop very soon Users/NikhilDahal
 I would imagine it would be simple, if it can be done on leather having a master do it on fabric shouldnt be a problem! Give her a jingle Daubert

20110823 08:34:34 nbsp My wedding dress came in two weeks short of my wedding date and about two inches too small. Elaine was amazing. She was very professional, thorough, and her services were well priced. She was able to repair my dress on short notice and did great work.
I highly recommend her. Users/nkristis
