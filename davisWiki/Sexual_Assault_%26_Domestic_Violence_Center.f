20110410 12:48:29 nbsp Just called their crisis line.  A woman named Angie answered the phone, and I dont know if its just me, but I feel like shes completely unsuited for her job.  I didnt feel like she sympathized with my situation, and (even though I know this sounds unreasonable, which it very well may be) she was way to cheery/peppy/happy.  I wish she would understand that were calling because we have a serious, outofourcontrol situation on our hands and need help.  And fuck their corporate questionnaire; is that all the operators ever care about?  Users/miniaggie
