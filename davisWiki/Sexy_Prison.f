Sexy Prison is Davis/Sacto duo comprised of Keenan Concerto Thompson (bass, electronics) and vocalist Kel Dawson Mitchell (also from Like Mike 2:  Streetball and formerly The Steve Harvey Show), and together they churn out some of the best and most original electrowhateverwave jams being pioneered on this planet today. Keenans basswork is propulsive and melodic yet dark enough to satisfy any Joy Division/New Order fan, but if you talk to Keenan about them, he might tell you that Crimpshrine was a bigger influence; its the one element of the Sexy Prison sound which might sound familiar because the rest is a concoction of clattery beats, repetitive sample sequencing, klings and klangs and klaxon reverberations set to odd elliptical patterns, humorously perplexing samples of familiar expressions of pop culture (e.g. Tim Allens unghh? from Home Improvement), and Kels uberwhacked reverbdrenched sneer. Jennifer Maerz of the Seattle Stranger wrote a Sexy Prison review which referenced Severed Heads; certainly the Priz does bear a striking likeness to the Sevs at times (particularly because both bands similarly used repetition in such a way that the moment that any sample or sound might become too cloying, that sound is replaced by a different odd sound), but Concerto and Dawson swear theyve never even heard music, and that Slutty Gulag draws its primary influences from their balls and the television show Cheaters.

Ben Duax claims the band name refers to the audience; youre in a sexy prison whenever the band plays.  Apparently, its the only prison you DONT want to leave.  He also claims the band found their name by watching the web page metaspy refresh google searches.
