Shadiness Factor:  A unit of measure that rates an individual/organization/action that uses shady (hidden/secretive/semiunlawful) means to accomplish a task.  Its one of many Wiki Rating Systems developed on this wiki.

Many things can be referred to as Shady, but what does this really mean?

Shadiness has a rating system of 1 to 10 (from least shady to most shady).

Heres is an example of a shadiness factor scale to illustrate the concept of rating things as shady (dont take this too seriously, though; its all for fun):
 1. Playing frisbee on the Quad (on a sunny day, of course).  Bike Church ministers not showing up for scheduled times, they have lives and sometimes other important things, but it just appears shady.
 2. Religious Fraternities (ie. Alpha Gamma Omega AGO and Alpha Epsilon Pi AEPi), People who discriminate against religious beliefs, Davis411.com, Davis Police Department.
 2½‎. Visiting a business as yourself but writing about it with a sockpuppets sockpuppet.
 3. Lamargate, http://www.ljdrama.org/ LiveJournal drama, Students for an Orwellian Society.
 4. Procrastinating Dog Ate Your Homework Shady, TAPS, the Halloween Headquarters store that sprung up in Davis Manor.
 5. The smell by the cereal in the Coffee House CoHo, Users/JonLi Jon Li of the Governance Task Force,  Student Focus recruiting http://ucdavis.facebook.com/group.php?gid2203923609 incoming freshmen on Facebook(c/o 2010), or LEAD using the same tactic for three years running (c/o 20102012) .
 6. ASUCD Open Government Plasma Screen TVs in the Coffee House CoHo, Kalen Gallagher saying Choice Voting is a disease.
 7. The Sterling University Vista Apartments Riot, Campus Crusade for Christ, Steven Ostrowski trying to take over the Progressive Coalition, ASUCD Elections, business owners sockpuppets leaving fake comments on their own pages.
 8. Campaigning in Dorms Controversy, advertising via sticking ads on bikes (stop this abomination now). AT&T murdering the talking clock. Fischer, Carrillo & Associates advertising services via spam. Websites like ucdavis.collegewikis.com. The Campus Crusade for Chaos and Confusion, Club Finance Council
 9. Rob Roy taking advantage of his position as manager of Ben & Jerrys for political purposes on Free Cone Day while running for City Council, by offering free ice cream on him, while the free ice cream in fact has nothing to do with his campaign. It might have been somewhat shadier if Rob then helped Unilever build an industrial ice cream waste dump in Davis.
 10. LaRouche LaRouche cultists, X Mr. Chans Chinese Food X, ASUCD religious political Christian Democratic Party parties, Steve Ostrowski suing your friends, Business Fraud.
 11. Sword and Sandals, a local secret society.  Rob Roy getting Winter 2005 ASUCD Election/Disqualification Controversy disqualified, Measure X/Covell Village campaign on campus  pizza for vote trade, hiring practices, Norb Kumagai campaign workers inside the polling center talking to students waiting to vote. The Shadiness Factor page. http://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crying_of_Lot_49 Tristero
 12. UCDPD Lieutenant John Pike battering November 18, 2011 UC Davis Police Response to Occupy UC Davis nonviolent protestors. Annette Spicuzza justifying this violence. Linda Katehi spewing bullshit in response rather than taking immediate action to ensure the campus is safe again.

Many shady comments are also posted on Restaurants, Bars & Beauty Salons and Barber Shops pages

Users/AshleyOrsaba has a different idea of what is shady.


20050216 15:30:29 nbsp I think this is hilarious.  Id love to start rating other pages.  Just out of curiosity, what shadiness rating does Students for an Orwellian Society get? Users/BrentLaabs

20050216 21:31:04 nbsp I think Students for an Orwellian Society are well beyond shady. We need to invent a whole new concept of shady for them :) Users/BryanBell

20050216 21:34:12 nbsp the Black Caesar was definitley shady as was Suicides Andrew Wiemans death. Users/KenBloom

20050221 12:39:27 nbsp i recently found out that two of my friends are members of s&s.  if these two jackasses are members, S&Ss shadiness factor should be well below Plasma Screens, which is, by far, the shadiest of the lot. Users/RishiTrivedi

I think the Shadiness factor (of the Sterling Riot) lies with the police Users/JamesSchwab
  I was there, the Sterling Riot was a clear and present significant danger to any innocent residents of the complex and their properties. It is my opinion that it was absolutely not shadiness on behalf of the police.  Users/KrisFricke
  There are proper methods of crowd control, from all the reports Ive read and heard, the police did not use proper procedure. Using proper procedure will lead to a decrease in tensions not increases. The Police are professionals and they should be able to properly disperse a crowd. Users/JamesSchwab
    Ive heard your objections to their nonlethal weapons and Ive studying that subject myself, but the point is that the crowd was already unruly, violent and threatening before the cops arrived.  I know people who feared for their lives and barely managed to escape (after being chased by large drunk riotious young males) way before the cops arrived.  The riot was in process before the cops got involved. Users/KrisFricke
      I never said the crowd wasnt violent, I never defended students, I criticized the police. Again, proper methods of crowd dispersion were not used. Users/JamesSchwab

20050309 13:41:18 nbsp http://www.livejournal.com/users/emosnail/163600.html Recent polling indicates that Rob Roys disqualification is indeed pretty damn near a 10! Users/KrisFricke

20050317 14:20:24 nbsp I think Jusco is pretty shady. Users/MarieHuynh

20050317 15:12:02 nbsp How bout the Tiqula Bledsoe incident? Users/ArlenAbraham
  Which Tiqula incident?  I think Tiqula in general was about a 10.1 Users/KrisFricke

20050318 22:15:57 nbsp i really dont like how Campus Crusade is put at a #9 ranking in being shady. Ive kept my mouth shut about christian bashing on wiki (because its sometimes funny i.e  christian kids saying darn and gosh), but the #9 ranking is going too far. Its a religious org and to give it a 9 ranking makes wiki users look like jerks  Users/GeorgejAndrews
  They are pretty shady though.  I am frequently accosted by them on the quad and around the CoHo (not so much this quarter tho) and they want to convert me or something.  That seems pretty damn shady to me. What rating would you recommmend? Users/GeorgeLewis
  Ill poll the shadiness rating of campus crusade for christ next time EMOSNAIL updates.  Well time after next, because we have another ASUCD poll overdue. Users/KrisFricke
    Having Fricke do a poll on Campus Crusade in EMOSNAIL is like having me do a poll on Nathan Thomas/Black Caesar/Dan Beeman Approval ratings among DCR members Users/GeorgejAndrews
      Im shocked George, that one would imply EMOSNAIL polling is anything but the paridigm of objectivity! ( Users/KrisFricke
      Okay George I think the polls have run long enough for me to reveal my true motive for running the CCC poll  the results in EMOSNAIL show a significantly lower (by .93) shadiness rating than the results in the ucdavis community.  I think we can safely say that the readers of emosnail are NOT unduly biased against religious groups. Users/KrisFricke

20050318 23:59:32 nbsp For Georges sake you might want to add the LaRouche people on the list...now those guys are WAY shady. Double the square?! Talk about brainwashing aholes! Users/JimSchwab
  Hmm, where to put the LaRouche people?  Its hard to decide, because its not exactly secret that theyre a cult.  Ive heard people saying the same thing at Ventura College, UCLA, and UCSB.  Perhaps 9, and move the Crusade up to 8?  We might also want to split off an ASUCD list in the future. Users/BrentLaabs
  ummmmm...YEAH.  Put those damn LaRouche people on there.  I been bothered at least as many times by them as the CCC.  Admittedly though, they dont bother me nearly as much for obvious reason.   Users/GeorgeLewis
  What do you say 7? 8? for LaRouche Users/JimSchwab
     I call it a 8 Users/GeorgeLewis
  Since it is now on the list twice, well keep the polls open on LaRouche.  I vote 9. Users/BrentLaabs
  10 damn it! they yell hella rude things to people and act like LaRouche is going to save the whole world even though he seems quite crazy Users/RevChad
    I agree Chad, but annoyance ! shadyness.  They arent very secretive, which is one of the main definitions of shadiness. Users/BrentLaabs
      They claim to promote thinking for yourself while trying to brainwash you, and they claim to promote math while Barnabas Truman tells me they are out to distort/destroy mathematics as he knows it.  LaRouche > CCC.  Users/RevChad

20050319 20:00:45 nbsp Philip, by calling this page a joke. I am offened. Are you saying my disqualification was not shady? You are no longer a friend. I hate you. Users/RobRoy

20050319 21:13:18 nbsp I see religious frats on here, but what about normal social or career specific fraternities?  Users/GeorgeLewis

20050319 21:16:39 nbsp Do joke pages have a place? I mean, yes I would consider some regular frats shady, but that is my own opinion. Others may find the ACLU or Choice voting shady.... Users/JimSchwab
   Then just make your own list :)

20050319 21:20:54 nbsp The religious frats are shady due to their connections with ASUCD.  Look through the history on Senate if you want to know more. Users/BrentLaabs

20050319 22:22:23 nbsp Im shocked and appalled that you rated the Orwellians as 3 on a shadiness list.  Shame on you.  The Orwellians are doubleplusunshady, and cant stand when they get negative publicity. ;) Users/BrentLaabs

20050320 16:19:07 nbsp I dont think these individual lists are a very good idea at all.  If you have a presonal list, put it on your own page or else before we know it this will have everyones list on it and the page will be crazy long.  Users/GeorgeLewis

20050320 20:00:38 nbsp Is Ashley Orsabas list reversed, with things descending from most to least shady?  Also I agree with George  I dont think this page is meant to be lists of shadiness so much as the things listed are examples to illustrate the One True List Users/KrisFricke

20050320 20:24:10 nbsp he he he, yes i DID screw up my list and now i deleted it, since apparently its alright if only some people are allowed to have lists but not all Users/AshleyOrsaba

20050320 20:36:13 nbsp Ashley, who said that?  I think that there shouldnt be any extra lists on this page and we should start a new page where people can post their own lists if necessary.  There should only be one list on this page Users/GeorgeLewis

20050320 20:52:13 nbsp people should add their own lists to show that people have varying opinions and so everyone is not accountable to the example list above. that way there is no attempt to represent everyones views.  If this page gets too long then another page can be made at that time. Users/KristenBirdsall

I removed the attribution of my list because I did not want it there.  I added my list because I felt it lessened the impact and seeming authority the first list would have.  There is no way there will be a concencious opinion on whether or not something is really really shaddy, so just showing differing opinions is important.  Besides, isnt the point of this page to illustrate the idea rather than convince us something is shaddy?  None of the items have explainations, so its probably just meant as an illustration.  If theres actual discussion about this stuff, why not add it to the individual pages instead?  I notice that the Sterling University Vista Apartments page has no discussion about whether or not the riot was X and Y, and instead this dialog has taken place elsewhere several times. Users/PhilipNeustrom

20050320 21:55:55 nbsp agreed. i like your take Users/AshleyOrsaba

20050320 22:20:56 nbsp Interesting.  I still think there needs to be some sort of standardized ranking system.  The original seemed fine to me.  heh.  oh well. Users/GeorgeLewis

20050320 22:22:39 nbsp I completely disagree with you because the top list does have more authority.  It represents a consensus decision on each item.  It represents polling at EMOSNAIL.  Your list is not as important as any of the other lists. If you werent an admin, Id be editing you now. BRBR  If you want to have different lists, Id prefer that they were about different things.  ASUCD, stores in Davis, the administration.  Users/BrentLaabs
   Brent, youre always free to remove my edits.

20050320 22:26:48 nbsp well i think then it sould say Based on emosnail or something b/c im sure im not the only one who didnt know the origin of the first list.   Users/AshleyOrsaba

20050320 22:29:27 nbsp Not all the things on the first list come from Emosnail Users/JimSchwab

20050320 22:45:19 nbsp Not everything comes from emosnail  Thats correct.  You all missed the point of what I was saying.  More people worked on the first list:

Users/MarkKlebanov, Users/BrentLaabs, Users/AdamGerber, Users/RevChad, Users/KenBloom. Users/KrisFricke, Users/JamesSchwab, Users/RishiTrivedi, and Users/PhilipNeustrom have all contributed to the first list.  The other ones represent a single persons list.

Can we edit those lists too? Users/BrentLaabs

20050320 23:47:25 nbsp Yeah, but it just doesnt feel right to remove your edits.  There has to be someone that we all respect around here, and I wouldnt edit you unless we got a consensus around here.  Whether you like it or not, youre not just any other person on this wiki. Users/BrentLaabs

20050321 05:21:12 nbsp Phil is a Glossary Davis Mount Rushmoreee! Users/KrisFricke

20050612 16:27:03 nbsp I think the Shadiness Factor page is pretty shady.  Users/MichaelGiardina

20050719 18:12:51 nbsp I got quite a kick out of this page, though it is so ucdkid centric that I dont understand a lot of it. Users/RocksandDirt

20050829 18:54:22 nbsp Well, hes less shady than TAPS, which is an organization that gives parking tickets.  And far less shady than the Sterling Riots.  Id say that hes doing pretty well for law enforcement. Users/BrentLaabs

20051102 08:26:27 nbsp Covell Village is upgraded to 10 after the last two days of illegal campaign practices on campus.  Users/SharlaDaly

20051102 10:46:34 nbsp TAPS is definitely shadier than that, and what about that damn firetruck? Users/AllisonEriksen

20051107 17:16:14 nbsp removed Measure X entry in category 9 since it was upgraded to category 10 Users/KarlMogel

20051107 19:28:22 nbsp I think the list needs to be inverted, with 10 at the top and 1 at the bottom. Users/SteveDavison

20060210 12:58:38 nbsp Is this shadiness rating system on a simple increasing scale, or is it on a log scale (i.e. LaRouche cultists are a million times shadier than frisbee players on the quad)?  Users/MatthewTom

20060809 16:51:32 nbsp Why, Natural Log of course! Users/KarlMogel

20060809 18:19:06 nbsp Wow, my old LEAD Freshmen 2009 facebook group made the Shady List!  Yeah, that was hella shady.  Add that to the list of my alltime best sinister plans.  Idve gotten away with it, too, if it werent for you meddling kids, and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scooby_doo#ScoobyDoo_in_popular_culture that dumb dog of yours  ;) Users/PaulHarms
                    Im going to start calling you Slim Shady Harms Users/JimSchwab

20060809 20:15:39 nbsp The shadiness is inviting mass amounts of freshmen simply to fill up groups and order them to vote for certain candidates without really interacting with them.  I think that might have been the original concern.   Users/SteveOstrowski
  Time to cut the cloak and dagger BS. Heres the facebook message that earns me a shadiness factor of 9:

From one freshman to another, Im asking for your help.

Im asking you to help me support LEAD and LEADs freshman candidate Ravi Deepak (he lives on Malcom 2 in Segundo) in this ASUCD election. (http://elections.ucdavis.edu)

LEAD is committed to both progressive values in our campus community and fiscal responsibility within ASUCD. LEAD fights for student rights, for your rights, when the administration, City of Davis, and our goverment try to act against our best interests.

If everybody on this group could get two of their friends to vote LEAD tonight, right now, that would bring us an extra 600 votes! Even if together we can only turn out an extra 100 votes tonight, that would make a huge impact on this election with its low voter turnout.

Some of us might not have had any direct contact with LEAD yet. Some of us, like me, owe a lot to LEAD for the opportunities weve had at UCD in the past months. Whichever is true, its time for us to support the candidates that support freshmen.

So please, please, please get at least 2 of your friends to vote at http://elections.ucdavis.edu

3 Friends would be even better. Or 4. Or your entire floor, if youre one of those overacheiving types :)

Thanks all.

Paul Harms
LEAD Campaign Treasure,
Freshman from Ryerson 515 (Segundo)

Users/PaulHarms Shady H

20061210 10:35:23 nbsp Steves position on academic Senate is no longer shady, as the ASUCD Senate voted 651 to confirm the appointment. Users/PaulHarms

20061212 16:26:01 nbsp I dont see how it is shady to take over the Progressive Coalition, I mean who wouldnt? Users/SteveOstrowski

20061214 16:59:42 nbsp Actually, AEPi is not religious at all, its just a collection of mostly secular jewish college students. Most of our brothers are not religious and we even have a catholic brother! Users/EricFriedman
 Hence why it has only a two. Its just a little more shady than a sunny day on the quad, and thats only because it is indoors and not outside. Users/MaxMikalonis
  what does religion have to do with the fraternity? aepi is considered a social fraternity, not a religious one. Users/EvanChait

20070121 17:26:26 nbsp Oh come on, youve always wanted to get sued at least once.  Users/SteveOstrowski

20070617 01:51:09 nbsp I would argue LEAD should be listed as shady or shadier than campus crusade. Users/CarlosOverstreet

20080820 15:56:48 nbsp If religious fraternities are a 2, then what are regular fraternities?
 Users/JoePomidor
  Choose between 5 (Student Focus recruiting), 6 (Sterling Riots), or 8 (Campaigning in Dorms)  Users/BrentLaabs

20090511 19:13:13 nbsp Something that is indubitably shady is the death of Hunter S. Thompson, for those who prefer the gozo sort of life. Check out the details:
Alleged that he knew something about 911 and that they would probably kill him and make it appear as a suicide, the firearm, though being semiautomatic did not have a bullet in the chamber, Hunters son in the next room said he heard what sounded like a book falling (which could have been the result of a silencer) and lastly, there was misinformation given by the authorities as to the crime scene.
 Users/bGul

20110503 17:38:19 nbsp Hey man, could you explain your comment please? I am not quite understanding your meaning behind your statements. Users/Dozer

20111004 14:17:46 nbsp Or any business really nd

shadiness factor? 10
