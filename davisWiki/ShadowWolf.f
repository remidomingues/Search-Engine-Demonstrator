I am a very nice people person, who enjoys photography, (mostly of wolves). I am also a very deep believer in the Spiritual organizations Wiccan and pagan beliefs. I wear a pentacle medallion around my neck for protection. The pentacle is often misinterpreted as a symbol of evil. I assure you it has no such ties. In fact, it represents the five elements; earth, wind, water, fire, and spirit. If you take even one away, all life The Tremont Church and Cemetery dies. I myself am a regular practitioner of the craft. I am a Wiccan energy healer. I have Davis Cemetery died over six times and no longer possess the human emotion of hate, so I love all things, both alive and notsoalive. Everything around you is alive in some way or another. I live (love?) all living things. Read into the ways of a craft before you judge it. We may be the purest people you ever meet.
