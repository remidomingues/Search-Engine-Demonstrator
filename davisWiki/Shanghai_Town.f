Shanghai Town is a very affordably priced Chinese food Chinese restaurant in Westlake Plaza, just a few storefronts south of Chuys Taqueria. There are vast quantities of every dish, including the appetizers.

Their regular menu is comparable to many of Davis other Chinese restaurants. They also have an alternative menu, pictured below, which contains a large selection of Dim Sum and Shanghai style cuisine. For the dim sum, they do not come around with carts, but they offer a large selection of dishes. As with any Dim Sum place, the value improves a lot if you order several items together, so its good to go (and share) with friends or to take out large quantities. First generation Chinese customers frequently order the Braised Pork Ribs in Shanghai Sauce and untranslated items listed on the rear of their Dim Sum menu.

The people working there are very nice, and their customers routinely consist of mainland Chinese natives. For folks not from China, this is an ideal place to explore a new cuisine, and point to the people next to you and say, Ill have what theyre having!

The owner of Shanghai Town moved her restaurant from San Bruno (about 15 minutes south of San Francisco) to Davis. It Departed Businesses replaced Hometown Chinese Restaurant, which moved for a short time to downtown Woodland, then to South Davis,and is now open at Mansion Square on E st.

Shanghai Town was the only Chinese Restaurant open on Christmas, 2005.

20090313 23:04:16 nbsp I went there thinking about having some good Shanghainese style food... I was WRONG. Its nothing like Shanghainese food, I might cook better. and I wont recommend anyone to go there. Users/Sherryii

20090423 12:52:10 nbsp They use MSG here...not a rumor. I asked.   Users/LokiAbbi

 Unless youre allergic to MSG, it really isnt that bad. A little bit in your diet is not bad for you.

  That is not really true.  MSG reactions are unpredictable, and you can eat it many times before discovering that you are allergic.  Anyone who is especially sensitive knows for sure how awful it is, and for the rest of us the debate is at best murky  just because you dont get as violently ill as your friends doesnt mean you arent poisoning yourself.  Any restaurant worth eating at should give you the option to order without MSG.

   And that is REALLY not true.  Ill refer to the Wikipedia article on MSG: While many people believe that MSG is the cause of these symptoms, a statistical association has not been demonstrated under controlled conditions, even in studies with people who were convinced that they were sensitive to it.

20090520 01:07:49 nbsp I like #4 green onion pancakes. It is delicious!! #13 Potstickers are pretty good. #18 Spicy Wontons. Be careful its deadly spicy but hella tempting. #22, 23, and 24 are ALL good. If you go here, you must get one of them.

The 2nd page of the menu is pretty good too. Try to get anything that says Braised Pork and on the bottom you can get 3 entrees for $1820. If you know what you like, choose 3 entrees and get it!!

BEST CHINESE PLACE in Davis if you know what to order.  Users/Andyboy

20091002 13:36:51 nbsp For Americanized Chinese food (Sesame Chicken, Chow Mein, Crab Cheese Wontons  etc) this place is just plain bad. Its about the quality of buffet Chinese food, only served at regular sit down prices. The wontons were oily and flavorless  a big disappointment for me. I see that they have several good reviews on here, my guess is that it is one of those places like Hometown where people come for the more authentic dishes, and not for the more Americanized ones. Hunan, Jade Garden, and Ding How are all much better for this more American style of Chinese food.  Users/JakeJames

20100103 01:53:51 nbsp Be brave and order something unfamiliar. Unfamiliar usually means nonAmericanized Chinese food, which is what this place definitely excels in. Lionshead soup, as mentioned before, is wonderful, and the eggplant in vermicelli is pretty awesome too. Service is lacking, be prepared to wait a little to be served. Its pretty hard to get the workers attentions too. A little out of the way for most people, being in West Davis, but this is probably the best Chinese food in Davis. Users/AmyOhe

20100203 20:37:58 nbsp My husband and I went to Shanghai Town last Saturday, along with our baby girlwho has an early bedtime, so we went at 5pm. We were their second customer that night in the restaurant, besides the callins which were frequent because many people came in for pickup, and the service there was attentive and prompt and our food did not take long at all...actually, it was quiet quick! each thing came out separately, but most Chinese places do that. And here is my main reason for writing a comment: The FOOD WAS AWESOME! Its the best chinese food Ive ever had and by far beats any Americanized Chinese restaurant in Davis. We had some sort of dumpling from the dim sum menu, which I didnt like, but my husband did, though I am not a fan of dim sum. Then we had Mongolian Beef with green onions, yum. Then we had some some sort of thick stir fry noodle with bok choy, that was good and not at all greasy. But the best of all was the Eggplant in a piping hot clay pot with some sort of brown sauce that I think had ground pork in it and then had glass noodles on the bottom. SOOOOOOO GOOODDD! If you go there you must get that! This place is authentic and very good. After dinner we did NOT have tummy aches or gas or bad bowl movements...to be frank about it, cause we usually get that reaction from Chinese food. Hope this helps! Well be going to this place for as long as possible weekly too! Users/JamieParker

20100223 00:20:37 nbsp The owners have opened another location called Gold Town.  It is in the Chevron gas station (Richards Blvd. & Research Park Drive) where Hometown was.  The place looks identical as when it was Hometown.  I had the General Chicken there the other day and it was pretty good.  I grabbed a menu with the phone number...but was just looking for it and I guess I lost it. Users/Josix

20100407 14:11:29 nbsp IMPORTED FROM YELP, MY REVIEW:

4 and 1/2 stars rounds up to 5. Their food is oh so delish! The reason for 4 and 1/2 and not 5 stars is for their service.

But in a way, you can tell that the only reason theyre still in business despite the ratty hole in the wall facility theyre located in and the crude service is because of the food. Theyre masters at creating chinese masterpieces every single time. And if you want dim sum, dont even drive to Sacramento. This place has got select dim sum dishes and chinese breakfast thats fingerlickin good to the core.

I agree with the other yelpers who have claimed that this is the BEST chinese restaurant in town. Hands down, Shanghai town has got my vote. They are a 5 star restaurant for their food, dont mistake this for a 5 star restaurant for service. So if youve got a craving for chinese, eat here and get down and dirty! slurp Users/AnniieRose

20100515 15:23:55 nbsp I was surprised that the man serving us last week was actually attentive and cheerful. You cant beat the price and the authenticity of this place (and you can shop Westlake next door!) :)   Users/LeeY

20100614 05:22:48 nbsp been here many times. Their food is quite good compared to many other Chinese restaurants around town but boy do I miss the Chinese food from LA. Generally they service is just ok, not great but at least their food is decent. I just wish they would upgrade their chairs. The cushion of their chairs are so worn out that youre basically sitting on the frames and the chair and hurting your ass.  Users/C.Ling

20100716 17:05:45 nbsp Even though the ambiance sucks, this is the best Chinese in Davis. You HAVE to try the eggplant in clay pot and the lions head soup. The a choy greens are very garlicky and yummy. I went for dim sum one Saturday and wasnt satisfied though. Users/JasperD

20100910 22:00:28 nbsp I tried my boyfriends leftover dinner from Shanghai Town,(i microwaved the eggplant clay pot the next night) and it was amazing! I wanted more! So I just came back from Shanghai Town tonight and it was delicious! the servers/waitors were a young adult and a young 10/11yr old boy. The service was okay because you can tell that it is family runned but my boyfriend and i did not mind. Our dinner was great! My roommates are chinese and they love this place! they recommended shanghai town to us! :) and im happy that i went! DELICIOUS!!! you have to try the eggplant clay pot!!! Users/RyanaLove

20110328 14:29:51 nbsp Went here the other day and was pleasantly surprised by the great food! Normally I go to Hunan, which is more of a cheap, greasy indulgence food. The food at Shanghai Town, however, was far less oily, and tasted more real or fresh than some other places in Davis.
The crabcheese wontons were filled with much more crab than I usually see, and the wrapper was thick and doughy, unlike most places that use a thin, cruncy wrapper. The pot stickers were also filled with a nice balance of veggies and meat, and werent fatty or greasy.
Delicious! Users/Morganna

20110606 16:48:52 nbsp My husband and I are not Asianstyle food connoisseurs by any means. We merely like food that tastes good. On our first visit we tried very safe foods (names we recognized from Panda Express, etc. Yah, were lame).... Shanghai Style chow mien, egg rolls, crab/cream cheese won tons, won ton soup, schezuan beef. Good portion size, good taste well come back. It seemed a lot less greasy than Wok of Flame which is very near our house. For that reason alone weve decided to drive a little more out of the way to come back for more. Users/EmC

20110630 22:56:50 nbsp they cock some traditional chinese food, but taste just so so.  Users/jayhsu
  Im sure this is meant to say cook :)  Users/jsbmeb

20110705 18:42:48 nbsp I really love this restaurant. The food is awesome. It is not so easy to order by phone. They dont always answer. But I still love them. Users/Sherri

20110706 22:22:09 nbsp I have to admit that I didnt like this place much the first time or two I tried it  not that I ever thought it was bad, but just that it was soso.  As a result, it was quite awhile before I tried it again.  But then when I did  yum!  Flavorful and fresh.  A bit more oil than Id like, but not too oily.  I think the mistake I had made earlier was in ordering some dishes that I dont usually eat.  Its fun to be adventurous sometimes, but lets face it, when most Americans want Chinese food, they want comfort food.  I suspect that if you order dishes you usually like that youll find they measure up to other places youve been, and that you wont be disappointed.  Users/CovertProfessor
  4 Feb 2012: The red bean paste pancakes are a decadent delicacy.  The eggplant and tofu dish is mighty fine as well.   Users/CovertProfessor

20110813 23:18:02 nbsp I tried this place for the first time tonight and really enjoyed it!  I went with my wife and a friend and between us we got the Shanghaistyle Chow Mein, the Three Meat Special with Vegetables, and the Spare Ribs in Sweet and Sour Sauce.  The chow mein was good; not all that exciting, but quite pleasant.  Nice, mild sauce on it.  Thicker noodles than the usual chow mein, and plenty of bok choi.  The three meat special was fantastic.  Quite spicy, delicious sauce, and the surprising and delicious mixture of chicken, pork, and squid, along with carrots, celery, huge hunks of jalapeno, and probably a couple of other veggies Im forgetting at the moment.  The spare ribs were also absolutely delicious.  It was just the slightly crispy spare ribs, some sesame seeds, and lots of the amazing sauce (which goes great over some rice once you polish off the ribs).

It was a big change from our usual order of the typical Americanized Chinese dishes at most other Chinese restaurants (general, kung pao, hot garlic sauce, etc.), and it was a very welcome change.  Ill certainly still be going to Hunan for our old favorites, but Shanghai Town will definitely be a goto for different, probably much more authentic, Chinese food.

I also like the atmosphere there.  Very basic.  Family owned and very friendly.  Theres a pitcher of water from which you serve yourself.  Photos of their specials ring the walls, so you can wander around and get some idea of what you want to try.  Members of the family sit at a table in the corner chatting and helping you with anything you need, at least on a quiet night like tonight (it was nearly empty at 8:30 on a Saturday).

All in all, highly recommended.  Try some of the specials, particularly ones that are different from what youre used to! Users/TomGarberson

20110814 07:27:22 nbsp They have the most authentic Chinese food in town besides Hometown, at least this is what all my Chinese friends say...We like it a lot because they will cook you something thats not on the menu of you know what to ask for.  Users/jsbmeb

20110822 07:06:02 nbsp This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Davis! I never got excited about Chinese in Davis (minus the Taiwanese plates at Hometown) until I came to Shanghai town. It definitely is not Americanized which is probably why I like it. Good portions for cheap and they offer dishes you cannot get elsewhere in Davis. Do not expect any service really and you will have a great time. I usually go for take out, but I have eaten there as well just make sure to take care of your own water. Users/KurtG

20111019 17:11:06 nbsp If you have a broad and accepting taste pallet, this is probably the best restaurant in all of Davis. I have to laugh out loud at all the other whiteskins I see coming in here to order general chicken and sesame chicken. This isnt Panda express!  If you want sickening meat candy, go to Panda, Hunan, or Silver Dragon! Users/ScottMeehleib

20111115 19:29:36 nbsp Food was excellent and the service was great. I asked for some recommendations for nonspicy tofu dishes for my oneyear old and the person taking my order offered a nice option. He even opened the door for me when I left since I had my hands full with a baby and takeout boxes. Given the amount of Chinese speakers in the establishment and how busy they were on a Tuesday night, I think this place is about as authentic as you can get in Davis. We will be back! Users/GlenWilkins

20120201 10:27:38 nbsp Ive been back a few times since my last review, and Id say that Shanghai Town has become my favorite Chinese restaurant in town.  The food is always excellent.  The ingredients always seem very fresh and perfectly cooked.  Some of the dishes are a little heavy on oil (Mongolian beef, for example), but thats just part of the cooking style.  They taste absolutely delicious.  There are also plenty of options that arent heavy on oil (e.g. three meat special with vegetables, which is one of our gotos).  Ive gotta say, though the Generals Chicken is probably my single favorite dish there.  I know, I know, how American... but the texture and the sauce are absolutely perfect.  The Shanghai style chow mein is a staple in our orders as well.  Its different from traditional chow mein, but really, really tasty.

Update: I recently ordered the Eight Treasures in Pepper Sauce (under the pork section of the menu).  Its the one thing Ive had there that I didnt absolutely love.  Its got an interesting mix of cinnamon and jalapeno.  The first bite is pretty interesting, but I couldnt eat more than a few bites.  It just gets cloying.  My wife didnt mind it as much as I did, but we still ended up throwing out most of the leftoversthe only time Ive done that with Chinese food.  Everything else we ordered was, as always, absolutely delicious! Users/TomGarberson

20120716 13:49:07 nbsp My new favorite chinese restaurant Users/JSlice

20121201 18:12:19 nbsp Food is great here.  Probably the best Chinese food in town.  However, waiting an hour for an order to go is completely unacceptable, especially when the place isnt packed and food was ordered a little past 5pm.   Users/BingL

20121201 23:43:13 nbsp Tried out the mu shu pork last week.  Best mu shu Ive ever had, bar none.  It looks a little messy because the ingredients are all shredded more finely than more places, but holy crap its delicious. Users/TomGarberson

20121217 21:02:29 nbsp The mushu pork is very good and is a lot of food for 7.95. Everything you get here seems to be a lot of food for the money. The potstickers and shanghai style chowmein are also great. The boiled beef doesnt have a very sexy name, but if you like beef and can handle heat, its one of the spiciest, beefiest dishes that money can buy. Didnt really care for the the salted, spicy ribs, which were breaded and fried little cuts of fatty ribs. Users/MikeyCrews

20130127 19:26:32 nbsp This is the best place for REAL chinese food in Davis! Dont order from the gringo menu. Users/JasperD

20130429 12:04:26 nbsp Eggplant Vermicelli and Shredded Pork Clay Pot dish is fantastic. Ive only ordered off the Shanghai Style Special menu for entrees, but every one of the dishes Ive tried has been very good. The Dim Sum is also worth a go. The place makes great food.
 Users/hoganhayes

20130627 10:06:10 nbsp Havent been here in awhile.  Wanted something different and saw that a post about the boiled beef.  Got that and the calamari.  Both were so flavorful and so different.  The boiled beef is nothing like its name. Users/LokiAbbi

20130719 13:04:31 nbsp The food here is pretty good. The americanized food is a little different than you would expect from most chinese restaurants, you can tell that it is made to emulate that style while still being home made (mostly at least). Two words of warning though:

First, if they say the food will be ready in 2530 minutes, they really mean 45 most of the time.
And second, if you deviate from americanized food and get more traditional beef dishes, be prepared to deal with cartilage. Not necessarily a bad thing, just a matter of taste.

Overall, quality and taste varies a lot dish to dish. I love their sesame chicken (which is definitely different from most sesame chicken Ive had) but Im not a fan of their general chicken. I love their boiled beef, but not so much their short ribs (read: not a fan of cartilage, otherwise they are fine). Depending on the dish, sometimes they fry chunks of chicken, and others they fry slices of chicken instead (slices tend to be kind of chewy). Sweet and sour items come with more fruits and vegetables than I would like, and the fruits and vegetables arent as cooked as I would like, and it comes in the typical expected sweet and sour sauce. Their shanghai chow mein is pretty good too.

Most of their dim sum is just ok from what I can tell, nothing to write home about.

And service is pretty much always slow, unless you go at lunch when they serve various dish specials in the same way panda express does, from heat trays. Users/AndrewJacobs

20140113 13:43:22 nbsp We love Shanghai Town ... weve been going here since college and even seen the little kid who helps out grow up over the years ... Not the fastest service but you get good chow for the price. Low maintenance place. Dont go for the fast food they have out at lunch ... take some time sit down and order something from the menu or the pictures on the wall. You wont regret it. I personally like the Shanghainese Prawns and the clay pots they have. Users/MimiM

20140615 15:58:38 nbsp Just went for the first time and I will be going back! The ambience is pretty cafeteria like, but that adds to the experience. The eggplant vermicelli was great. We also got the pea sprouts, which were delicious and fresh it seems like one cant lose with the simple vegetable dishes.  Users/IdaFischer
