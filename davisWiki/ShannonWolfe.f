Hi Shannon, welcome to the wiki! Were you trying to create a page for your business? Id suggest renaming www.classicalsinger.net/shannonwolfe to your name Shannon Wolfe (you can click on that link in order to create the page) or something that better describes your business, since thats how people will find your entry. Then you can include your website under the contact information, along with a description of what you do. Feel free to play around with it and ask any questions you have! This is a community and its a pretty helpful one.  Users/ElleWeber

Good luck! :)  Users/ElleWeber

20090709 16:16:05 nbsp I deleted the www.classicalsinger.net/shannonwolfe page. Elles suggestions about creating Shannon Wolfe makes sense because you are trying to advertise your services, not the website address. Users/JasonAller
