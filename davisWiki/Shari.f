20081107 16:36:40 nbsp Thanks for the welcome! Dadgummit, I dont have a photo! Everytime we thought to take one, wed hurry to get the camera and the sun would do that sun thing and sink below the horizon in mere milliseconds! :) Users/Shari

I lived and worked in Davis from 2002 through August, 2008 and absolutely fell in love with the town and the people. I moved to Palo Alto recently because my husband found a job he really wanted out here. Im struck by how different it is here, especially the drivers! Overall, theyre impatient hornhonkers. I dont think I heard a horn honk in six years in Davis unless someone was in danger of hitting a biker or another car. I miss Davis terribly! I miss Picnic in the Park and Unitrans and Nugget. The good thing is I made lots of friends in Davis whove encouraged me to visit often.
