Howdy, Sharla.  I was wondering if you could add a little bit of support or backing to the phrase the incident had a damaging effect on the commissioners confidence in Shelly as Chair from http://daviswiki.org/Shelly_Bailes_and_Ellen_Pontac?actiondiff&version282&version181 this edit you made.  Thanks!



If so, could you quote the specific?  If it can be cited, it belongs there.  Even if it cant, it may well have a place there, but considering the... uhh... well, drama... it sure would be much easier if you could come up with a short, pithy, very specific citation. Users/JabberWokky


20060724 18:11:50 nbsp I loaded a round 1.5x1.5 sticker on the fundraiser page that Im hoping will work for you! Since color wasnt an issue, I assumed it would be created using an inkjet printer so I went ahead and created it with color overlays. Anyway, Ive got a drinking date about 11 minutes ago. I really hope what I posted works for you! Users/AlphaDog

20060725 11:14:37 nbsp I emailed the sticker pdf to titanium press about 30min ago, but Ill do it again bec my browser crashed shortly thereafter. I referenced it in the subject line as Sticker for Sharla Daly, I believe. Users/AlphaDog

20060725 11:16:11 nbsp Sorry... the subject line reads, Sharla Daly Sticker Order and was sent at 10:37am. Do you still want the file resent? It appears to have gone out without a problem. Users/AlphaDog

20060725 16:38:22 nbsp Since you ordered 2 stickers, let me know if you want revised artwork sent to the printer. Its ready to go now if you want. Users/AlphaDog

20060725 16:42:04 nbsp He was able to manipulate the pdf, so we are good to go.  We can be more exact next time.  He had time to slip it in between bigger jobs, so I just went with it. Thanks! Users/SharlaDaly

20060725 16:47:47 nbsp thanks, theres so many damn reverts and edits and reedits on that page I had no idea which one to go back to.  i think its obvious he just wants that line removed, period,  but so be it.   Users/EdWins ES

20060725 17:13:47 nbsp {{{Stop}}} (note, i have it surrounded by curly braces here) is the Stop macro. You can see it on my page where you commented, or the bailes/pontac page. It puts up a little stop sign and asks people to refrain from editing the page and links to the talk page. See wiki:wikispot:Help with Macros for other macros. Users/ArlenAbraham

20060730 16:20:20 nbsp It may be better to leave the reviews on the page and use the Talk page to discuss which to alter, etc (leaving copies of the reviews there for discussion, perhaps)  Otherwise the page will be very bleak (as it is now).  It will probably take a while to sort the reviews out and improve their organization. Users/PhilipNeustrom

20061220 17:38:33 nbsp oloLOLoloL sharla, how do you now so much about the juvenille justice system / drug court in yolo county ^_~ Users/StevenDaubert

20061221 14:26:47 nbsp I became interested during the Halema Buzayan case and found that there was very little information available to parents and the general public  so I researched and talked to people and pulled it all together.   Users/SharlaDaly

20070115 16:15:49 nbsp That page certainly has pulled together, its a wealth of info now. You get a high five next time I see you! Users/StevenDaubert

20070405 16:18:43 nbsp Sharla  I created County Services and proposed repurposing City Services to becoming a more general entry.  Please add and link everything you can to those two.  When they are mature, anybody can link them from the front page.  Thanks for the observation that there was a lack of an easy index for local services. Users/JabberWokky

20080301 13:19:39 nbsp Crazy reading about the HOAs and the fees with liens and forclosures

please do tell me more! Users/StevenDaubert

20080623 13:32:19 nbsp Hey, thanks for the Juvenile Curfew link.  Back in the late 90s, a large group of us marched three times into the West Palm Beach city meetings on the subject to voice the community stance against it.  My brother once got dinged on the curfew in North Palm Beach, only getting out of it because he had gone over to clean my Dads office for pocket money, and thus it counted as a job related excursion.  What a horrible way to raise young human beings who are supposed to become free and empowered adults. Users/JabberWokky

20080821 16:01:24 nbsp hi Users/StevenDaubert

20120827 16:42:10 nbsp Sharla, did you work at Fluffys Donuts @1975? I also remember visiting Davis in 1986 and the same gal (you?) was still working there. Users/rastamon
