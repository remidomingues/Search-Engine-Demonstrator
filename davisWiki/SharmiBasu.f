20080706 17:38:06 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. Generally we try to retain history on the wiki, so even if something is no longer there we just mark it as such. One way to do that is to use the Include macro like {{{Include(DepartedBusiness)}}} for businesses that are no longer a part of Davis. Users/JasonAller

20090602 19:12:32 nbsp The featured page section is for an actual page on the wiki. Since there is no page about your event, I took it down. Really, thats the type of thing that should go on the events board, anyway. I have no idea why VEER was up there, though. Users/WilliamLewis

20090602 21:00:24 nbsp Could you please put the symposium information on the wiki:Sacramento Sacramento wiki? Thank you.  Users/NickSchmalenberger

20090612 12:06:31 nbsp I think putting the symposium information on the Daviswiki is reasonable for all the reasons you said, but now Im curious why it is a Sacramento event at all? I wasnt asking you to take it off the Daviswiki before either. I do think its weird though when another town is occasionally invaded like with UCD Research on West Sacramento. The wiki:westsac other wiki:sacramento wikis deserve better treatment than having information about their topic on the wiki:davis Davis wiki. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20090613 10:37:47 nbsp I dont believe anybody has asked you to remove information, in fact, people have asked you to keep more information and share it elsewhere. Users/JabberWokky

20090816 10:52:48 nbsp How did the Sacto Zine Symposium work out? Did you get photos to add to the page? Users/JasonAller

20100407 19:54:09 nbsp Would be awesome if you created a new, independent page for the 2010 fundraiser filled with information and pictures of the years fundraiser  similar to what happened in 05  KDVS Fundraiser, 2005.  Maybe KDVS Fundraiser, 2010?  And you could link it from the featured page. Users/PhilipNeustrom

20110107 07:45:45 nbsp Hi Sharmi, so cool that you added the New Volunteer Meeting to the Wiki Events Page {were on the same frequency}. We will also be publicizing the event on the Quad today (Friday), Monday, and Tuesday. If you can come and say, Hi! CYa later. :) Users/lilmonstu
