Welcome to the Wiki Howdy Sharon, and (even though youve been around for awhile) welcome to the wiki.   My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for adding the info about Feral Cats options, but it would be much more visible if youd just contribute to the top of the entry rather than putting such a great deal of information down at the bottom where its less likely to be read.  The entire wiki was built by contributions from the community, and I think the topic of feral cats... or community cats... would benefit greatly from you adding your information directly into the main body of the entry about them.  Once again, thanks for the information! Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
