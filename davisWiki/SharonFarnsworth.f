As a dealer of rare and scarce books and ephemera, specializing in independent and small press literature and poetry {I have some signed Black Sparrow firsts, for example, and include copies of Yugen in my personal collection}, as well as a collector and occasional broker of antique and vintage clothing —couture if I can get it— from the Victorian and Edwardian eras {and earlier) through Forrtuny and Fath {I can dream, cant I?) to the ever fabulous Bill Gibb, Biba, Mr. Freedom, Mr. Fish and most certainly the Ossie Clark/Celia Birtwell partnership of the 60s and 70s {recently featured at the V&A. Even more recently I was disappointed to miss an exhibition there dedicated to perhaps the best designer of the late 20th/early 21st century, Vivienne Westwood}, I often find myself travelling up and down the west coast, from Baja, California through British Columbia and beyond in search of intriguing items. If anyone reading my profile is interested in purchasing, selling or maybe even tradiing any of the above or similar, drop me an eline. I am also always looking for new places to eat, shop, listen or see things during my peripatetic travails. That line I mentioned? If you know of any of these, I want to know about them too.


My stand alone online shop opens in February. Ill post the link when its ready.
