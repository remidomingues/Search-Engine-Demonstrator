Shattered Landscape (Blank Canvas) is a twopiece Music Scene band featuring Jacob Mealy on Guitar/Keyboards and Users/WillJobe Will Jobe on Drums/Percussion/Vocals, formed in Spring of 2007. They play an electic mix of bluesmetal avantgarde psychedellic noise rock influenced by acts such as Lightning Bolt, Hella, Duracell, and the like. They recently played their first show at a Cinco De Mayo party, and will play many many more in the future. They say what they try to capture is Abstract art in musical form. Will calls it the kind of band hes always wanted to start. They will someday take over the world and their music will be featured in every videogaming video game ever.
