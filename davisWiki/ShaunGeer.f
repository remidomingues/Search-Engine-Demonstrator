Shaun Geer has apparently forgotten how to Bicycling bike. As such, he can often be seen plastered to a tree or fence.

The cool thing about this paper, to me, is what is left unsaid... that you can use information theory to help build an HIV vaccine.  I should totally take some signal processing classes!

Im now a sociologist.  I still want to take signal processing classes. Go figure.
