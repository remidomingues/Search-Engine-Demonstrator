~PLATFORM ISSUES~

CAMPUS THEFT

Did you know that out of 4000 students polled, 1 out of every 5 had their bike stolen. Currently, property theft is the number one crime in Davis and it is directly affecting YOU! I will work in collaboration with the Student Police Relations Committee, the UC Davis Police as well as the City of Davis Police to get surveillance cameras put in all main locations on campus, where the majority of bikes are located and ensure that our bikes DO NOT get stolen.

INDIVIDUAL TUTORING FOR ALL

The Learning Skills Center only offers free private tutoring for athletes, ESL students, and other special circumstances. I am an athlete and think that it is unfair to not provide individual tutoring to EVERYONE! Regular students, LIKE YOU, should be able to receive free private tutoring. I will work with the Learning Skills Center and Advising Services to ensure that we provide free peer tutoring for all!

AGGIE PACK PRESENCE FOR ALL DIVISION 1 SPORTS

I want to work with Aggie Pack to help increase student attendance at ALL of our Division 1 games. Its time we give credit where its due and support ALL of our DIVISION I STUDENTATHLETES!

ETHNIC & CULTURAL WEEK

Our campus is so uniquely diverse, but we dont publicize and represent every group. I will work with the Ethnic and Cultural Outreach Assembly and the Ethnic and Cultural Affairs Commission to create and institutionalize an Ethnic and Cultural Week. Id like to set one week aside to have all our ethnic and cultural clubs and organizations tabling out on the quad with their information and a food sample for you to taste. Each group would have one day out of the week set aside for them to showcase an aspect of their culture (i.e. through dance, music, lecturer, poetry, etc.) On the final day of the week, you will all be given the chance to immerse yourselves in a complete multicultural atmosphere. A dance!! Music from all over the world and refreshments. Open your mind and meet people from all over the world!
