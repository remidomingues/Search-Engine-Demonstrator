Hi!  My name is Sheila.  Some time ago, I was living with some guy who lived outside all the time, but then some policemen came and took him away and I didnt have anybody to take care of me.  They took me to the Yolo County SPCA.  They called me Appleberry, and they put me in this little cage.  I tried to be happy, but I sure missed somebody to be my very own person.

Then one day some people came to look at me and they brought me home to their house.



It seemed like a nice place.  They let me sleep in their bed and they took me to the Dog Park where I met other Dogs dogs like me.



They take me to Petco and get me fun toys and yummy treats.  I think Ive found a permanent home with these people, and I am a very happy dog.
