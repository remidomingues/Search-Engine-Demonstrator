20100917 11:02:49 nbsp Looks to me like youre doing well so far!  Congrats on opening up the business.  When you get a chance, I suggest rewriting the page from a thirdperson perspective.  Remember that its a page about the business from the communitys perspective. Users/TomGarberson

20100917 12:53:19 nbsp It looks like youre doing great.  If you need any help, there are plenty of people around who you can ask.  If I may suggest getting a biz email?
