Shelly  I moved the content of the Talk page you made for SharlaDaly/Talk to the correct location at Sharla Daly.  Keep in mind that /Talk pages are for temporary conversation and intended to be deleted when the conversation is finished, and that pages with peoples names as one word (like Users/SharlaDaly) are personal pages where the user controls the content (like this page for you), versus the public entries about those people, which have spaces (like Sharla Daly), which are edited by the community (like the Shelly Bailes and Ellen Pontac entry).

20060814 00:10:17 nbsp Hi, Shelly,  I just wanted to point out that this isnt Wikipedia.  (You made an edit recently that implied that you had this site confused with Wikipedia.  Its a common misconception.) Users/GrahamFreeman

20060814 13:16:46 nbsp Howdy, Shelly... Davis Wiki is not Wikipedia.  For instance, opinion is not allowed on Wikipedia, while it is encouraged here.  After that incident, Stephen Colbert was blocked from making changes to the entry about him because his edit was considered vandalizing an entry.  The entry itself was locked from all nonadmin editors for a period of time to prevent further vandalism.  Wikipedia is quite heavy handed and strict about such things.  Davis Wiki is far more tolerant of abusive editors before moving to ban or block them. Users/JabberWokky

20080529 14:42:01 nbsp Shelly,  hello my name is Martin and I am a photojournalist who lives in woodland.  I am actually going to school at Sacramento City College seeking to be a photojournalist for life.  I was wondering if I you would be willing to allow me to document your marriage which is going to happen next month. I would like to cover all the ups and downs, parties, struggles, etc.

You can reach me at macinmarti@gmail.com and hope to hear from you soon.
