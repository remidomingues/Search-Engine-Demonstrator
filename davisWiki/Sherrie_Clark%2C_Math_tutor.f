Help for the Math Phobe or enrichment for the Math Whizz. I have twenty plus years of helping Davis students from 3 rd. grade through Calculus with math.


20140507 12:27:34 nbsp Im a 30something returning student who suffered from math anxiety. After becoming frustrated at not understanding the core concepts of math from high school, I sought out help. Sherrie is an outstanding math tutor who explains the fundamentals of math in a way that not only makes sense, but is also fun! She is very attentive to my specific needs and always knows ahead of each session what well be working on. My anxiety has dissipated and my confidence has skyrocketed. Dont let bad instruction in high school put you off getting a degree, Sherrie will help you and youll enjoy the process.   Users/AndrewLightfoot
