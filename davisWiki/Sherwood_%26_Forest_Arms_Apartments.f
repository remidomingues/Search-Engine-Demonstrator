Sherwood & Forest Arms Apartments is an apartments apartment complex located over on Wake Forest Drive.  For those following along at home, this puts you about two blocks from campus and one block from University Mall. ,

Okay, the real attraction, beyond the cute curly iron sign and the fact that the driveway goes under the buildings?  This is one of the most pet friendly apartment complexes in Davis.  Even large dogs are welcome.  Add to that the fact that theres a nice little backyard with a picnic table and happy tree, and this is where you and your four legged friend can live.

The complexes are located on Unitrans B bus line BLine and C bus line CLine and are on the same street as the Cuarto dorms, about two blocks from campus.

They say they are a familyowned and operated joint, and they have one and twobedroom apartments.  That translates to the fact that they are managed by StarCrossed Properties, which seems to have a pretty good reputation as of 2012.

20060603 17:37:28 nbsp Rent for fall 06 is $875 for 1bd.  Anyone have experience here or know of anyone who has lived there? Is the parking that horrendous on wake forest?  There seems to be a small public parking lot next door.  any issues with vandalism/tickets? AlbertYoon

20060622 00:23:14 nbsp I am in the process of placing a deposit to secure an apt.  I did a brief check on apts around campus, and Sherwood is one of the rare those that havent received complaints.  I took that as a good sign.  The management seems responsible and patient, which is always a good sign.  I think you might be able to contact the office and show them your concerns. ChingChing

20070102 09:34:32 nbsp I lived a Forest Arms and I had to take the owner to court for my deposit. I won, but what a hassle!! ChapRes

20080514 07:39:15 nbsp I am currently living at a one bedroom apartment in Sherwood Arms.  I would like to move out by July 1.  If you are interested in taking over my lease from July 1, 2008 to August 31, 2008 please contact my roommate Gerald at 5304003070.  Dogs of all sizes and cats are allowed here.  The parking on the streets is bad during the school year but good during the summer.  You have the option to rent a parking spot in the garage for $20 a month, which is what I do; its definitely worth it!  Ive never received a parking ticket while parking on the streets or in the free lot here. Users/Jennifer6677

20081108 07:52:48 nbsp I was just wondering if anyone knows if there are dog breed restrictions at Sherwood Arms? Users/Melinda

20090818 10:24:28 nbsp Ive been living in Sherwood Arms for a couple of months now and I thought Id put in my 2 cents. I moved to Davis from the east coast (for grad school) and didnt know one thing about this area. I went ahead with Sherwood Arms because it seemed like they were one of the few places in town that allows dogs without any sort of restriction (that I know of) and there certainly isnt an extra pet rent tacked on like some other apts. I really liked the set up of the place because it isnt one of those multistory apt complexes where you could hear loud neighbors above, or worry about being noisy for people down below, and not to mention that each unit has its own deck. For an extra 20 bucks a month, you get your own garage parking spot which has been so worth it given this summer heat, so I dont feel like Im going into a sauna when I get in my car. Kari the apt manager has been very helpful so far, esp with me not knowing anything about this area and Tom the owner, was quick to come fix a light that went out in my walk in closet. I really havent experienced any cons to living in Sherwood, though I have to admit that the built in desk in the bedroom is monstrous and somewhat unsightly but nevertheless still very useful given that I moved to Davis without a single piece of furniture and it has saved me from having to buy a desk. I would definitely recommend it to other graduate students who are looking to live close to campus in a quiet atmosphere for a reasonable rent.  Users/JinK

20100607 12:20:39 nbsp The management has recently changed and it is for the worst! I do not recommend living here! For one there is a recurring rat problem in the attic (thankfully the rats havent decided to come down into the actual apartment yet). Our fridge has been leaking since we moved in and while the first apartment manager was quick to fix it, it has broken again and the new manager hasnt done anything about it. Parking isnt free, its an extra 20 a month and parking on the street isnt realistic (unless you only need your car on the weekends). There are no extras with this apartment at all! No pool, no gym, no nothing. The complex is old and money is wasted on random unnecessary things. Oh, and the lawn in the back is covered in dog crap, they dont enforce picking up after your dog at all...   Users/supergirlanna
  We have been trying to keep the place cleaner.  It is difficult to clean up after bad residents.  We do not want to change the pet friendly policy.  Promise we will try to do better  Users/TomCross MGT 101810

20100805 00:05:38 nbsp Ive lived in this complex for several years now, and it has been a positive experience. The apartment is in good condition, the community is pleasant, and if I ever have a problem management is quick to help me. For example, I just returned from vacation to find my window shattered. I have no idea how it happened, but after getting in touch with the property manager, Diana, she had my window repaired in the same day at no cost to me. Whenever something breaks or I have a concern, I can count on management to come to my aid. Users/AndyL

20100926 17:02:29 nbsp I had a mixed experience living here. The space in each apartment is very good, especially compared to how small a lot of other Davis apartments are. If you are a big fan of light, you will probably be a bit disappointed, as there is only one sliding door, one window in the bedroom, and sometimes another window in the kitchen. It is in a very collegestudentheavy area, so sometimes there can be a bit of noise. You can get a parking pass for the garages, but it all depends on when people leave who already have passes. Street parking is very difficult during the week, as there are no City of Davis parking passes required for most of Wake Forest Drive.

In terms of management, my experience was very mixed. When there were small problems,they were fixed almost immediately. However, larger problems took a much longer time to resolve and at certain times, I felt like I was blamed for these problems. Thus, it was stressful to resolve large problems. There seemed to be a lack of communication between the apartment managers (those who live on site) and the landlord (who lives in Viking Apartments).
 We agree that communication could be better in our system!  We are working on improved communication.  Please call us to discuss this matter.  We would like your input to help improve our service to all residents 5307577368.   Users/TomCross Mgt 10/18/10

In terms of my deposit, it was originally issued incorrectly. I was able to get all of this resolved within the week, however. Please be aware that if you want the deposit refunded to only one party, or split in separate checks, you have to have each party sign a waiver (not something they tell you, but please make sure to ask!).

Overall, I would not recommend living here. Positives are that the square footage is great and they do allow pets. However, the difficulty and delay in getting things taken care of caused a lot of undue stress.  Users/Kipusa


20140204 09:29:06 nbsp This has honestly been the best apartment weve rented in Davis. They are not just tolerant of pets, they are genuinely pet friendly. If you are a responsible pet owner, you can expect an experience that makes your pets feel like family rather than something to be endlessly scrutinized. There is no pet rent and the security deposit for pets (and the apartment for that matter) is quite reasonable.

The complex is located on Wake Forest Ave, a surprisingly quiet street considering how easy it is to access the highway and the rest of town. Oxford Park is right across the street and is perfect for taking the dog on a romp and catching a glimpse of Davis famous roving bands of wild turkeys. ;)

Denise, the community leader, has been a fantastic liaison. She is always prompt with responses to my emails and maintenance requests. Unlike other managers, she actually listens when we warn her that our cat may try to escape when she enters! Beyond that, she is easy to work with and has even offered to pet sit for us on numerous occasions.

The apartment itself has a huge front porch that was perfect for growing plants, storing bikes, or working on various projects. We were able to score a unit with a dishwasher as well as a huge walkin closet which my wife and I were actually able to share! The apartment has a lot of room and is organized in a way to maximize space and make it feel larger (i.e. the kitchen is a nice square room rather than a sort of odd hallwaylooking affair. There is a separate sink and vanity /outside/ of the bathroom, which is great when one person needs to shower and the other needs to brush their teeth or do their makeup. Weve also never run out of hot water there (which is impressive considering the number of baths both myself and my wife take).

Honestly, if you have pets and want an affordable apartment thats not on the farflung outskirts of Davis or located in an undergrad ghetto, you really need to check this place out.

20140216 22:00:26 nbsp I really enjoyed living at Forest Arms with my husband and pets. The apartment was spacious and well maintained. Excellent location; I loved walking my dog in the park across the street. We had to duck out of our lease early because my commute was too difficult, but the apartment manager, Denise, was very understanding. She helped us find a new tenant. Would have definitely stayed if my commute were not so long. Users/karusso
