The Reserves in Shields Library is wonderful for students who want to save money on textbooks, Movies movies, and Music music. Professors often put on Reserve textbooks, optional class materials, and other hard to find books that may be of interest to the class.  If you do not see what you need http://harvest.lib.ucdavis.edu/F/?funcfile&file_namefindb&local_baseucd30 there, chances are that your prof either forgot or doesnt know the free service exists.  Ask nicely and most professors are happy to help you out.  Materials may be checked out for 2 hours, 1 day, or 3 days, which is set at the discretion of the instructor.  As long as holds have not been placed on materials, they may be http://lib.ucdavis.edu/dept/access/reserves/renewals.php renewed in person or by phone.  High demand materials that are on loan for 2 hours at a time must be held for 15 minutes in case someone else needs it.  1 and 3 day materials do not require a wait period.

While you can check movies out at Hart Hall, the reserves movies are loaned out for 3 days. In order to renew them, one must either call reserves or go renew inperson. If you call in, have the barcode number ready to the item(s) you want to renew as well as the barcode number on your aggie card Student ID Card. There is no online renewal, so watch out for the late fees. There are a few mainstream and recently released films, but take advantage of the foreign and documentary selections which often contain obscure selections. Make sure to check if what youre renting is in VHS or DVD format.

As the Signs signs scream out at you, have the call number ready and your aggie card Student ID Card out. Dont know the call number? Use the UC Davis Computer Labs computers near the desk to search the reserves catalog.

Note that there are a few incompetent people working in Reserves that do not know all the policies and may hassle you and waste your time.  Do not be surprised if you are given contradictory information and be prepared to deal with some bureaucracy.  Should their computer system ever go down, some may insist that you have to pay fines even if you tried to renew your books.


20060130 00:16:18 nbsp I took STA13 and borrowed the textbook from the reserves for an entire summer session. I had to renew the book every 3 days. Luckily, there were 3 books available and the class only had about 120 students so my book never got recalled. However, I would not advise relying on the reserves because of the hassle and the uncertainty that comes with it. If there is only one textbook available and another student puts a hold on your book, you will be out of a textbook (possibly during midterms). I ended up paying $4 because I forgot to renew the book the day before finals. Users/DussonYeung

20070225 15:43:01 nbsp On the reserves website, there is also a link to look at old/practice exams.  Of course the only exams that are listed are ones that professors have put up themselves.  I would advise looking even if your professor didnt say anything about it.  I was surprised to see several exams for my accounting class. Users/KirstenOnell

20070228 01:38:25 nbsp I just thought I should point out that the link for Reserves is not just for Shields, it also encompasses HSL, PSE, MCL, etc. Users/KirstenOnell

20070524 21:43:46 nbsp Reserves has a number of less well known resources. For instance, you can borrow a wireless card for your laptop and Faculty and Staff can borrow  bicycles. Users/Dimitri
