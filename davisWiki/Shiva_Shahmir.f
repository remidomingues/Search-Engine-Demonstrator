Shiva Shahmir went to Davis High School. She is involved too much with KDVS, Crossbill Records, Delta of Venus amongst many other things.

Shiva is good with sound systems and publicity.

You could often find her working sound, at KDVS, selling merch, passing out fliers, driving, in the middle of no where, performing, carrying heavy equipment, and/or drinking coffee and solving crossword puzzles at the Delta counter with Pete Brown.

Shiva is a DJ at KDVS 90.3 FM on the show Eh? 9:30 noons on Tuesdays and is now the KDVS Events & Live Sound/MDU Coordinator.

Outlandishly silvercrowned, Shiva driftwooded outside of a croaking bulltime barbeque smoke burger on Google.
