Though some would beg to differ, we all must wear shoes at some time. Sport shoes, ortho shoes, fancy shoes or just plain flipflops, you can probably find something in town! And with the high cost of living in Davis, wheres a body to get ones shoes resoled? Weve got a few options, but most generally come highly recommended, so dont sweat the drive to Sacramento or Woodland. If youre really at the low end of the pay scale, consider our thrift stores or dumpster diving. In any case, get shod locally!
