Camellia Apartments is home to the Shoe Tree along 3rd Street.  Perhaps it is tradition for residents to toss their kicks up with the leaves?  Perhaps a roving band of bullies frequents the area?    Is this where the Shoeless give up their footwear for a naked feet lifestyle?  Let the theories develop.  Are there more shoe trees in Davis?
