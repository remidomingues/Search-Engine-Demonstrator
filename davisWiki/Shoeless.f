Footware is often thought standard for people. Others rather go barefoot for health, spirituality, expression, or other various reasons.  It is not illegal to drive barefoot in California (despite http://web.archive.org/web/20030618105020/http://www.urbanlegends.com/legal/driving.barefoot/driving_barefoot.html urban legends), nor is there any health code requirement that restaurant or business patrons wear shoes (http://barefooters.org/healthdept/CA.html Source). Businesses can certainly ask you to leave, but they are also allowed to let you stay.  The http://barefooters.org/ Society for Barefoot Living maintains an extensive site regarding legal and practical questions about going barefoot.  Liability is an issue often raised by business owners as justification for shoe requirement policies.  If youre interested in law,  here is a fairly extensive list of  http://www.ahcuah.com/injury/ Footwear (or lack thereof) Injury Cases in the United States.

Barefoot Friendly Establishments
   Davis Food Coop supports people who live alternative lifestyles in general, and accepts barefoot shoppers.

   Safeway Safeway Inc. does not have a shoe requirement policy for customers, and the employees dont enforce an imaginary one either.
   Fleet Feet Sports loves runners; even ones who dont buy shoes!  They sell other things too. Golden Valley Harriers GVH doesnt care what kind of shoes you wear (or dont), as long as you run.
   Kims Mart doesnt mind selling things to barefoot shoppers.
   The Old Teahouse  no shoes, no problem.
   Delta of Venus doesnt hate.  Watch out at night however: people drop beer bottles at and theres often broken glass around outside.  If youre not used to BFing, take it easy.
   Coffee House Shoes arent required anywhere in the COHO, unless youre an employee (CalOSHA).
   Mishkas Cafe
   ACE Hardware
   ...many others.  Davis is pretty accepting of barefooters.  Most shops welcome a barefoot patron, a few have issues (see below). In general as long as you arent belligerent, most places wont harass you.

  Yolo County Central Landfill.  You dont want to be barefoot on the mountain of garbage anyway.

  Lucas Macdonald is Davis native and University student who usually lacks shoes by choice, though he has since been required to wear them in his job as a crossing guard. Other activities he does barefeet: LARPing at the Death Star and biking (rain or shine). Witnesses have seen him getting kicked out of the campus computer labs due to a lack of proper attire.

  I never wore shoes when I was young, I would always run /play in the Grande school site field barefoot.   Users/StevenDaubert
