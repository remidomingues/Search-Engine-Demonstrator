ShortEared Owls (Asio flammeus) are named for their very short, barely visible eartufts. The owls inhabit fresh and salt water marshes, grasslands and dunes. Unless you can see in the dark, you are most likely to spot one in the late afternoon, when they begin hunting for the evening. They have one of the largest geographic distributions of any owls owl in the world; spanning across Eurasia, North and South America into the Caribbean and even Hawaii. Shorteared owls usually lay about 47 eggs per clutch and usually stay in monogamous pairs.
