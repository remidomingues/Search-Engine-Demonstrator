Shot Checkers is a Drinking games drinking game that requires a chess/checkers board and enough shot glasses for both players. You get super crunk, fast.

How to Play

Fill shot glasses, play checkers and whenever a piece is taken, the owner of taken piece has to take the shot.

Its recommended that one use a cream liquor or something that is relatively low in alcohol, or fill the shot glasses 1/3 the way full. Sadly I doubt anyone is savage enough for full shot checkers.
