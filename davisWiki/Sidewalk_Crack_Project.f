The Sidewalk Crack Project is an attempt to document locations where Davis sidewalks are in desperate need of repair.  This includes major cracks and uplifted sections. Naturally, potholes should be document with the Pothole Project. Sidewalk cracks present hazards to the elderly, UCD Student Disability Center disabled, Chihuahuas, those pushing Parenting strollers, and people who do not pay attention to where they are Places to Walk or Run walking.  Furthermore, they are potentially dangerous to people on rollerblades, rollerskates, Skateboarding skateboards, and Bicycling bicycles.  These sidewalk deformities are a liability and, in some instances, can lead to litigation and even Death death.

If you add a location to this list, please note specifically where the problem is and when you observed it, and email the information to the citys Pavement Manager mailto:nmckee@ucdavis.edu Nancy McKee.

When you are out looking for sidewalk cracks, keep an eye out for undiscovered WPA marks as well!

Sidewalk Crack Listing

  Alhambra Drive  The entire north/south span has some fairly large raised concrete issues on both sides of the street.

Philosophical Musings
Can a The Grass Sidewalk grass sidewalk have cracks?
  More than you could count, my friend...  More than you could count.

 Buckles 

Sometimes sidewalks bukle instead of crack, like this buckle on Arroyo Ave that has grown into quite the vertical bump:


Repairs








20070408 22:02:32 nbsp Take Russel westwards towards where it becomes Arlington.  The trees are in the exact middle of the sidewalk, causing people to actually walk in the bike lane around it, and the cracks pictured above are babies in comparison! :D  Users/EdWins

20070409 15:02:57 nbsp Just wanted to say this page is an awesome idea! Users/MikeIvanov

20070409 15:12:54 nbsp Thats the nice thing about wikis.  No matter what page gets created, there is at least one other future reader that will think it was a great idea to create the page! Users/WesHardaker

Hmm is it really a sidewalk crack. Couldnt it just be the sidewalk ending? and perhaps a new sidewalk beginning. We should contemplate on these paths we walk. ~Users/DavidPoole

20070409 18:40:49 nbsp And we could write a book about it!  We could call it Where the sidewalk ends.  Oh wait... Users/WesHardaker

20070411 19:52:59 nbsp If you build a sidewalk near a large tree, the roots are gonna exert pressure and break through the concrete. Users/TusharRawat
 If you plant a small tree next to a large sidewalk, eventually the roots are gonna exert pressure and break through the concrete.  :)  Users/WesHardaker
  If you plant a tree, and fail to water it properly, its roots will rise to the surface to access the additional water. It isnt about the tree being there so much as the tree needing water. Just noting, we are the root of the problem still. ~Users/DavidPoole

20070412 01:39:09 nbsp H street just got some potholes filled. Users/StevenDaubert

20070412 10:42:07 nbsp I never noticed the cracks until I had a stroller to push. There is a doozy of a crack on Fortuna that is next to one of those mobile basketball hoops (that shouldnt even be on the sidewalk). Users/NoelBruening
    excellent point. i didnt even think about people that had to push strollers. thanks for mentioning this!!! Users/JessicaRockwell

20070422 19:09:45 nbsp Do the bumps in the left lane of eastbound Covell (between the Marketplace and Albertsons) qualify to be mentioned on this page?  After years of filling them in, someone, Im guessing the city, finally gave up and put up a sign to slow down to 30 mph.  I recommend just avoiding the lane...its worked for me for 10ish years. Maybe I need to create a Bumps in the Road page, hmmmm.  Users/KristenMartin
  20070422 19:53:58 nbsp The last edition of Davis Focus said this was a scheduled Capital Improvement Project.  http://www.ci.davis.ca.us/pw/cip/cip.cfm?cipCC668759245A4EB8B97F1058E495F9D8 here it is. Users/EdHenn
  Good to know, thanks!  Users/KristenMartin

20070727 13:29:14 nbsp crack is whack Users/JackkiCox

20070727 14:05:49 nbsp Did this page just become productive, Lamar? Users/BrentLaabs

20080224 20:38:40 nbsp I agree with EdWins, Im a landscape architecture major
and in my long duration of schooling, Ive learned that, that planning job is whack. I dont know how anyone without centipede flexiblity and cougar reflexes could manuver through that sidewalk.
I bet Evil Kenivil could do iton a flaming dirtbike. Users/Domlertylique

20081120 15:36:17 nbsp Do sidewalks made of asphalt count? There are some really bad cracks/lumps on the asphalt paths in North Davis, along the Perimeter Greenbelt green Northstar Greenbelt belt and Anderson Road Anderson, due to tree roots. Really bad for strollers and uncomfortable for bikes (for my bike, anyway). Users/gurglemeow

20081120 15:43:00 nbsp Ive noticed that some of the gutters at bus stops will ooze, and sometimes gush, muddy water when the bus pulls up. I assume this is mud under the road that is being squeezed up by the weight of the bus. Also, at the southbound Anderson and Villanova stop, one of the blocks that makes up the sidewalk sometimes rocks back and forth, if the bus runs over the right spot... Users/JoePomidor

20081120 22:16:10 nbsp Isnt sidewalk crack stepping the leading cause of the breaking of the backs of the mothers of the sidewalk crack steppers? Users/IDoNotExist

20100318 10:06:11 nbsp In this economic climate, I must object!  Starving lawyers need all the sources of frivolous lawsuits they can get! Users/TomGarberson
