The Sierra Club is a national Organizations organization founded by John Muir in 1892. It is dedicated to environmental causes and outdoor activities.  The club offers many Hiking and Backpacking hikes and other outdoor activities which are led by Volunteer Opportunities volunteers.

The local chapter is the Mother Lode Chapter, based in Sacramento.  Within this chapter is the Yolano group, serving Sierra Club members living in Yolo county (Davis, Winters, Woodland), part of Solano county (Dixon, Rio Vista) and a small part of Colusa county.

The Mother Lode Chapter lists many activities in the chapter newsletter, the Bonanza. This includes activities specifically intended for Singles Scene singles (see http://motherlode.sierraclub.org/singles/), Senior Citizens seniors, and Rainbow Community gays and lesbians.  The Yolano Group also has its own newsletter, the Yolano Flame; however, more activities are to be found in the Bonanza.  Both newsletters can be found on the websites listed above.

The Yolano Group is joining forces with the Lake Group and the Napa Group in order support Tuleyome Tuleyomes effort to create a http://www.tuleyome.org/projects/campaigns/blueridge/index.html National  Conservation Area (NCA) in the Blue Ridge Berryessa Region.  The exact size and area of the proposed NCA are yet to be determined, but could be as large as 800,000 acres, including Cedar Roughs and Cache Creek Wilderness Areas.  It may reach north to the Snow Mountain Wilderness.  One hope is that designating this area as an NCA, giving the area a formal name, will make Congress acknowledge the local and national importance of this region.  The goals are to:
  Protect the conservation resources of the region
  Enhance public recreation consistent with ecological preservation
  Sustain the working landscape and its economic viability
  Help local economies
The Blue Ridge Berryessa National Conservation Area Campaign is looking for http://www.tuleyome.org/projects/campaigns/blueridge/action.html donations and volunteers.  Also, on January 19th, 2008, the http://redwood.sierraclub.org/lake/ Lake Group is hosting a public meeting at the Brick Hall in Lower Lake to talk about the biological diversity of the Blue Ridge Berryessa region (with a keynote speech by UC Davis biologist Dr. Susan Harrison), as well as to discuss the NCA proposal.
