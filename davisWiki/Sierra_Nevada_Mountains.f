The Sierra Nevada Mountains form the eastern boarder of the Sacramento Valley, in which Davis sits.  They contain a wonderful set of Adventures Outside of Davis, including Skiing and the ever popular Lake Tahoe.  On a clear day you can look to the East as you turn the curve on Covell Boulevard (just past Harper Junior High School) and spot them off in the distance, just beyond Sacramento. You can learn more about them from a nonDavis perspective wiki:Wikipedia:Sierra Nevada (U.S.) here!
