Sierra Sod and Supply has become a division of http://www.parkavenueturf.com/ Park Avenue Turf in Dixon.  The office has relocated there.

To start driving from the old location on South Mace Bouldvard to the new Dixon location, go south on Mace Boulevard over Putah Creek to Grasslands Park and turn right on Tremont Road heading straight west.

They sell a few varieties of sod  you know, lawn grasses  and can deliver it to your home or business.  They do contractor and wholesale business as well.

One of their associated businesses has been weight certification for semi trucks and other vehicles.  They are the only local company that provides this service.  They have been charging the same $8 for years.  The scale and its business will remain at the Mace Boulevard location.  It doesnt appear to have been sold.  It is acticipated that the office space will be occupied by a contruction business currently located in West Sacramento.

This business was sold about early October 2010 by John Martin, son of Richard Martin who was one of the two founding Martin Brothers.  He still owns the land however.
