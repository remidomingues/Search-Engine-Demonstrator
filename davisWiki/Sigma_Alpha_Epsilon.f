Sigma Alpha Epsilon, or ΣΑΕ, is located between Sigma Alpha Epsilon Pi (to whom they have no relation) and the Islamic Center.

Having the most fun in Davis, excelling academically, and making a difference in the community are goals which all brothers aspire to.  It is the largest social Fraternity at UC Davis with over 54 active brothers in 2006.  Members pride themselves on being well rounded and participating in student government, the greek counsel, and many on campus club and intercollegiate sports.  Sigma Alpha Epsilon members are sometimes known as Sig Alphs. In March, 2006, Sigma Alpha Epsilon marked the 150th anniversary of its founding.

The fraternity unparalleled housing facility includes the following: a horseshoe pit, poker table, Beirut table, big screen television, pool room (with a pool table, dart board, television, and couches), basketball court, sand volleyball court, foosball table, large grass area, patio, and a large basement that sometimes acts as a dance floor.

The brothers have weekly events including movie nights, EVERY Intramural sports IM sport (days vary), meetings every Sunday, dinners, and study hours.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon is not to be mistaken for Sigma Phi Epsilon or SigEp SigEp. It is appropriate to address a member of this fraternity as an SAE.

The fraternity was forced to shut down in 2012, primarily due to alcohol violations.


 Credo 

For more than half a century, SAE members have recited The True Gentleman, and no other words, save perhaps those of the ritual of initiation, have more nearly represented the ideals of Sigma Alpha Epsilon.

The True Gentleman

The True Gentleman is the man whose conduct proceeds from good will and an acute sense of propriety, and whose selfcontrol is equal to all emergencies; who does not make the poor man conscious of his poverty, the obscure man of his obscurity, or any man of his inferiority or deformity; who is himself humbled if necessity compels him to humble another; who does not flatter wealth, cringe before power, or boast of his own possessions or achievements; who speaks with frankness but always with sincerity and sympathy; whose deed follows his word; who thinks of the rights and feelings of others, rather than his own; and who appears well in any company, a man with whom honor is sacred and virtue safe.

 Local History 
On the night of March 9th 1856, eight gentlemen founded Sigma Alpha Epsilon.  The http://www.calkappasae.com California Kappa chapter of http://sae.net Sigma Alpha Epsilon was established in 1952. Sigma Alpha Epsilon started in Davis as a local fraternity known as Phi Alpha Iota which had a house on the 200 block of A St. The location has since been replaced by the offcampus book store. Phi Alpha Iota was founded in 1913 on the UCDavis extension (at the time) making SAE the oldest running fraternity in Davis. In 1952 around the time when UCD became its own campus, Phi Alpha Iota searched out Sigma Alpha Epsilon as the national fraternal society that best matched their own ideals of being True Gentlemen and sponsored the start of the California Kappa chapter of SAE. In the early 70s SAE moved to a house at the end of Russell called Cactus Corners. In 1978 SAE left the Cactus Corners house to its present location on 521 Russell.

Unfortunately, after an event that ended with an ΣAE pledge in the hospital in Fall 2009, the Fraternity was no longer recognized by the University. The National Fraternity did not pull their charter and the members still held social functions, meetings, and generally continued to conduct their business. The University once again recognized ΣAE as a school organization in Fall 2011.
