Sigma Alpha Mu is a widely known Fraternities fraternity on the University of California Davis campus. Going by the acronym of their name SAM, they are often referred to as the Sammies by the student body. Formerly a Judaism Jewish fraternity founded 1909 in New York City College, it has since expanded across the nation as an open Fraternities fraternity for all men. With now upwards 70 chapters and over 50,000 members, Sigma Alpha Mu is a constantly growing brotherhood of men.

The Gamma Theta chapter of Sigma Alpha Mu is approaching forty years in age and has since doubled in size within the past decade. Known for its often large beginning of year parties, it is one of the most active fraternities within the campus. For the 20142015 years, Sigma Alpha Mu will be moving to a brand new lettered house at 310 Parkway Circle, otherwise known as Frat Circle. Events are often held throughout the quarterly system alongside the startoff Fraternity Rush which starts at the beginning of the quarters.

The Sigma Alpha Mu Fraternities fraternity is also very well known for its philanthropy events for the research aid for the Alzheimer Association. Hosting several competitions and events alongside several other noted organizations  the Sammies are often seen around campus in a myriad of events. As of 2011 the chapter has started participating in intermural sports as well as continuing the tradition of event hosting for the UC Davis population.
