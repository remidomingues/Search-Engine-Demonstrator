>One, and the main, aim and object of Sigma Chi has been, and is, to develop and train broadminded men who can recognize the wholeness of things and who are not bound down to a contracted, eight by ten notion of exclusiveness. There is an absolute necessity for such men. Founder Benjamin Piatt Runkle<





Sigma Chi is a brotherhood with roots in friendship, equality and education as part of their overall responsibilities to the broader communities in which they live. They achieve these ideals through promoting those character qualities embodied in their Rituals, and continuously reaffirm their purpose through the observance of Sigma Chi’s Governing Laws and through adherence to the decisions of their legislative assemblies, which empower and direct their activities.

In addition to its 217 undergraduate chapters and 145 alumni chapters, Sigma Chi is comprised of four operational entities: the Sigma Chi Fraternities Fraternity, the Sigma Chi Foundation, the Risk Management Foundation and Constantine Capital Inc.

Fundamental Purpose

The fundamental purpose of the Sigma Chi Fraternity is the cultivation, maintenance and accomplishment of the ideals of friendship, justice and learning within their membership.

Sigma Chi Fraternity best serves its purpose by developing, implementing and monitoring programs that foster leadership, build character and promote positive relationship skills which, in turn, enable our members to become productive and caring participants in their families, colleges and communities.

Core Values, Vision and Mission
Sigma Chi’s core values are friendship, justice and learning. Their vision is to become the preeminent collegiate leadership development organizationaligned, focused and living their core values. Their mission is to develop valuesbased leaders committed to the betterment of character, campus and community.

The Theta Omicron Chapter of UC Davis

The chapter house is located next to Kappa Alpha Theta, Sigma Phi Epsilon and Tau Kappa Epsilon at 400 Parkway Circle directly across from the Activities and Recreation Center (ARC).

The Theta Omicron chapter has been recognized for its dedication to the National Fraternity’s philanthropic endeavors with the Children’s Miracle Network as well as various other local organizations, including the Sacramento Children’s Hospital, by Chancellor Larry Vanderhoef and the University of California, Davis.

As of August 2005, the National Fraternity has also added the Huntsman Cancer Research Institute to it’s official list of charities. The Theta Omicron chapter will continue its work to fundraise for both organizations, which in the past has yielded thousands of dollars in donations annually. Most of the donations are a result of Derby Days, the chapter’s main philanthropic event.

Derby Days

Derby Days is Sigma Chis annual philanthropic, weeklong event where sororities compete in a number of activities for the first place prize of $1000, a sum which goes to that sororities chosen philanthropy organization. It is one of the largest Greek philanthropies on campus and raises thousands of dollars from the generous donations of the sororities, local businesses, past Alumni, and members of the Davis community. 100% of money raised during Derby Days goes to the Childrens Miracle Network and Huntsman Cancer Research Institute.
