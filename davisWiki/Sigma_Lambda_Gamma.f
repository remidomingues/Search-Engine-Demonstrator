Hermanas por vida, Sisters for Life

During the fall of 1989, the foundation of Sigma Lambda Gamma National Sorority, Inc. was commenced by collegiate women who recognized the need to form an organization that provided empowerment to women of all cultural backgrounds. Her humble beginnings were built at the University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa where their vision was to create a network of academic and social support for Latina women. Under the guidance of Esther Materon Arum and Mary Peterson, the vision came to fruition on April 9th, 1990, as the University of Iowa Panhellenic Council officially recognized the organization as a sorority.



Through the continued commitment and leadership of the founding mothers, the operation of Sigma Lambda Gamma has thrived on many college campuses and provides an avenue for educational excellence to women of many nationalities. Our members recognize the need for togetherness and support among women of varying cultures at the university level and they remain dedicated to the overall success of women in a global environment.



Sigma Lambda Gamma is a sisterhood of women who have chosen this affiliation as a manner to achieve personal development and awareness to the responsibility of community involvement for the betterment of our local, regional, national and global communities through the efforts of a network of close to 3,000 sorority members. Furthermore, we continue to be a pioneer in the Greek fraternal world through development of innovative programming initiatives, such as the Young Women’s Leadership Program and Emotional Intelligence.

Sigma Lambda Gamma National Sorority Incorporated is the largest, historically Latinabased national sorority with a multicultural membership in chapters and alumnae associations throughout the United States – from Arizona to Wyoming; Florida to Minnesota; New York to Texas; and many more states between the coasts of California and Rhode Island. A criterion for membership into Sigma Lambda Gamma is open to women of exceptional morals & ethics with a demonstrated commitment to academic excellence, and who are pursuing or have completed courses leading to a degree in an accredited college of university.

Sigma Lambda Gamma National Sorority Incorporated was established at UC Davis on June 10, 2006, making it the 81st chapter wiki:wikipedia:Sigma Lambda Gamma in the nation. They are known as the Mesmerizing Mu Gamma Chapter. One of the primary goals of the sisterhood is to promote their ever evolving rich and diverse cultures by sharing them with others through the five principles of; academics, community service, cultural awareness, morals and ethics, and social interaction. They believe that culture is pride and pride is success.
