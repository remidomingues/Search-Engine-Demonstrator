National History
The year was 1866, and unbeknownst to their fellow cadets at the Virginia Military Institute (VMI), three men were about to set out on a mission to change the preexisting system of physical abuse and hazing of underclassmen. Amidst the turmoil and civil strife of the Reconstruction period, a time during which the south was struggling in vain to recover from the ravages that the war has wrought on their society; James Frank Hopkins, Greenfield Quarles, and James McIlvaine Riley came together due to their equally shared feelings of discontent with the hazing situation, ultimately becoming the founding fathers of the Legion of Honor, later known as Sigma Nu Fraternity. Due to the fact that the VMI enforced a strict code of honor, it seemed only fitting to the founders that one of their governing principles be honor; however, the other two principles were undoubtedly to be love and truth. In contestation of hazing of any kind, the founders set out to form a society that would use these principles to create equality amongst its members.

Motto: Love, Honor, Truth

Local History
The Zeta Xi chapter in Davis opened in 1952; however, due to the dismay of the chapter, it was closed in 1991.  After nearly two decades of dormancy since the chapter closed, the Zeta Xi chapter at UC Davis officially received its charter back during the Winter of 2009.  The 29 new founding fathers of the Zeta Xi chapter all came together to build a 400+ page petition to make this possible.  The accreditation of the Zeta Xi petition was the fastest in the national fraternitys history.
