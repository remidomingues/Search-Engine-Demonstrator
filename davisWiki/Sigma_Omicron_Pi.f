The Sororities sisterhood of Sigma Omicron Pi was established at San Francisco State University in 1930 by ten Asian American women pursuing the interest of teaching. They chose the Greek letters, Sigma, Omicron, and Pi to represent themselves as the Sisters of Pedagogy. The Constitution was derived from an existing Honorary Society of Education.

The sorority was active in the Asian Community for the next 15 years. At the advent of World War II, the organization was forced to become inactive. In 1946, a group of women from the University of California, Berkeley, reestablished Sigma Omicron Pi on their campus. Since its inception, Sigma Omicron Pi has grown in membership with student chapters at:

 Beta Chapter: San Francisco State University, 1988
 Gamma Chapter, San Jose State University, 1992
 Delta Chapter, University of CaliforniaDavis, 1993
 Epsilon Chapter, Sacramento State University, 1993
 Zeta Chapter, University of CaliforniaSanta Cruz, 1995
 Eta Chapter, University of MarylandCollege Park, 1997
 Theta Chapter, University of CaliforniaIrvine, 2001
 Iota Chapter, Pennsylvania State University, 2001
 Kappa Chapter, University of California San Diego, 2002
 Lambda Chapter, Johns Hopkins University, 2002
 Mu Chapter, University of CaliforniaRiverside, 2003

Though the sorority no longer centered around the interest of teaching, it still maintains its commitment to the Asian American Community. All of the chapters became extremely involved in their respective communities, volunteering their time at community agencies and raising money to donate to favorable charities. Sigma Omicron Pi earned a respectable reputation as a benefactor to the Asian American cause.

The purpose of Sigma Omicron Pi is to promote unity, lifelong friendships, leadership, and community service. This organization offers women a supportive network of sisters to achieve academic and social growth. The sisterhood of Sigma Omicron Pi provides an environment where sisters may utilize and develop their organizational skills.

Each one of our sisters has different interests and aspirations, yet we all share one common groundSigma Omicron Pi. We have based our sisterhood on four objectives  UNITY, FRIENDSHIP, LEADERSHIP and SERVICE. In addition, Sigma Omicron Pi has a tradition of lifelong friendship that has prevailed for over 7 decades.
