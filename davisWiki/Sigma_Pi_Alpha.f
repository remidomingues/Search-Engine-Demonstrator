Sigma Pi Alpha (aka Ellas & Sigmas) is a nonpanhellenic Chicana/Latina based sorority. It is not greek but is a sisterhood and has greek letters as a representation of the life time of sisterhood and to show Chicana/Latina heritage by spelling Ella which means she/her in the Spanish language.
There is an educational pledge process, not rushing with an emphasis on you chose us, we dont chose you.
While it is a Chicana/Latina based sorority it is not limited to a specific race. Instead there is a focus on overall issues affecting Chicana/Latinas and women overall as well as on education and community.
Mainly identified as a nonprofit community service sorority, Sigma Pi Alpha also works towards academic excellence and networking.
