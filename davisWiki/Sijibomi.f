20100802 17:58:08 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. You are welcome to sue me if you want, but take a look at http://daviswiki.org/Con_Artists?actiondiff&version2402&version1401 my edit first. Users/JasonAller

20100803 01:33:09 nbsp Dont think it could be a lawsuit for posting it here. It was based entirely on a flyer going around and we are concerned about scams and cons in this town as there have been several, especially recently. We at the Wiki do strive to be honest and concerned citizens and that is not a crime. However, on occasion some falsehood is posted about any number of citizens (including Wiki users, and when this happens a consensus is usually reached within a matter of days, as can be witnessed in the case of Mr, AtaBaah. Once a consensus is reached the offending material or post is removed and the Wiki community continues on. Peaceful, informative and, in general, friendly wikizens make this a great place to be.

20100803 22:06:42 nbsp @ WesOne and JasonAller.I appreciate your efforts to help clear Ata Baahs good name,image and reputation but I am just confused that there is still a picture of him on here.I thought the general consensus was that he is being defamed by these people or person.Please remove the picture completely. Users/Sijibomi

20100804 02:00:57 nbsp I will be speaking to him about this next time I personally see him and will relay his wishes to the editors here. Users/WesOne

20100804 19:51:32 nbsp @WesOne....thanks so much for everything.I really appreciate it. Users/Sijibomi

20100804 20:03:08 nbsp Sijibomi, its good that youre standing up for your friends reputation.  Please be aware, though, that legal threats are not taken kindly here.  There is no case whatsoever.  Even if there were, publicly threatening lawsuits is generally a bad way to go about getting things done.  Hell, most sites (not the Wiki, no worries) will ban anyone who threatens them with legal action, whether justified or not.  In the future, please reconsider taking that approach. Users/TomGarberson
