Silent Throne was a liveaction Roleplaying games roleplaying game (LARP) set in the Changeling mileliu of http://www.whitewolf.com White Wolfs World of Darkness.  The StoryTeller was ErikBerman Erik Bob Berman, the game drew about thirty players and ran every other Saturday at the Death Star Death Star.

Whats this mean in nongeek?

Every other Saturday night about thirty people dressed up like changelings (modern faeries) and met at the HSS Building for an interactive, improvisational theatre session.  Each player took on a character of his/her own creation and acted out the drama of their lives for a few hours.  It was a fun diversion, pretending to be a mythical character for a few hours  like going to the movies, only much cheaper (free!)  and its a new show every week.
