THIS BOOKSTORE IS NOT OPEN ANYMORE. So like, make sure you dont get to school 10 minutes before your 8:30 a.m. final planning to grab a lastminute scantron here or something, because that will not work.
The Silo Bookstore is an extension of the UC Davis Bookstore that caters to School of Law law Graduate Students students. Every savvy seniors favorite place to get a lastminute blue book, the Silo Law Bookstore is located at the eastern edge of The Silo building. The entrance is under the awning and is somewhat difficult to recognize as a bookstore. I have it on good authority, however, that they do sell books there, in addition to the precious, precious scantrons and blue books (which are located to your left as you enter). They also sell sodas and snack food for much less than the Silo. For example, a 20 oz. bottle of soda costs over $1.50 at the Silo, but only $1.25 at the Silo Law Bookstore.

The stores price matching process can be more trouble than its worth.   LawStudent2011
