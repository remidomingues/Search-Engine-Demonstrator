Any public forum (from a Parks public park to a sidewalk crack project random sidewalk to Front Page this wiki) allows anybody to say what they think.  Sometimes the first person who voices their opinion has a somewhat oddball opinion compared to most peoples experience, but until somebody comes along to correct it, its the only thing out there.  Thanks for adding your voice to the Russell Ranch entry... I encourage you to add more information to the actual entry (just hit edit, and add information or photos right into the entry itself, editing and expanding the entry).  The only way to put forward real information about a subject is if somebody who knows it actually contributes it.  It seems like you know and love Russell Ranch, so I hope youll add more to the entry so it better represents what the Ranch is. Users/JabberWokky
