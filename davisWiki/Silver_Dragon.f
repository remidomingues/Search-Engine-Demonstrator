While renowned by some for its General Chicken, Silver Dragon has been criticized for a higherthanusual rate of inedible or unsanitary objects in the food (such as hair and bugs).

Others, however, claim enjoying meals without incident and find the food affordable and of comparable quality. For example, the restaurant was ranked third best Asian cuisine in the California Aggies California Aggie/Best of Davis 07 Best of Davis 2007 list.  Its also a good spot for solo dining friendly solo dining during lunch, with attentive wait staff that is quick to refill your drink.

Alternatives include Great Wall for a buffet, Panda Express for more American Chinese food, and Noodle Express for better atmosphere.

Silver Dragon has a less than stellar http://www.decadeonline.com/insp.phtml?agencyYOL&violsortfieldTB_CORE_INSPECTION_VIOL.UPDATE_BY&record_idPR0000895 health inspection record.  It isnt horrible, but definitely worse than average for Davis.

History

Back in the 60s and 70s, the location was held by Toppers Steakhouse.  As recently as the 90s, Silver Dragon still had a wagon wheel chandelier, and the backs of the bright red chairs were emblazoned with the Toppers steer head logo.


If you want to feel like youre at a truck stop, eat at Silver Dragon.  Users/JeremyAbramson

Ive been to this place a couple times, and I had pretty good food.  It sort of is a diner, so I dont think the look really matters.  Sure, I wouldnt take a girl there on a date, but its not awful or anything.  Personally, my favorite Chinese place in town is Hunan.  I would suspect a lot of people like Silver Dragon because the place always has a lot of customers?  Users/PhilipNeustrom

The sad thing is that arguably the most authentic Chinese food in Davis can be gotten at Old Teahouse, in terms of selection and serving food without sweet sauces, although this says little about quality.  For those who truly love authentic Chinese cuisine, its hard to do much better than New Canton. Its Chinese name is something like Towards the Wind, just to be random, and it is located on Broadway & 26th in Sacramento.  Chef Tony Su, used to be Executive Chef at ABC in Milpitas, the best Chinese restaurant in the northern half of California (sharing this honor with Hong Kong Flower Lounge in Millbrae).

There is a bit of Davis history available here if you look for it; take a close look at the decor the next time you go in. Look for the steers with the capitol T on their foreheads. The tables and chairs have the logo of the restaurant that was there before Silver Dragon. Their lunch offerings are good.  Users/JasonAller

The food here is the best Chinese food Ive found in Davis so far, and the prices are pretty good.  Main course, rice, soup, and egg roll for about $6.00.  Food is good quality Americanized Chinese.  Service is really, really terrible, but it is bearable because the food is good.  Definitely try the Generals Chicken steamed rice plate. Users/JacobOrenberg

I dont recommend it. While some of my friends rave about it, I think the food is gross and unsanitary.  Last time I ate there I found pieces of metal (perhaps foil?) inside my eggrolls, and a loonngggg piece of hair in my General Chicken. EWWWW.  Needless to say I have not been back since.  Users/AshleyOrsaba
  I think this restaurant caters to people who love general(s) chicken.  I have no idea why, but it seems that Chinese fans, seem to be broken down into two camps, with the silver dragontype fans prefer the sweet sauces.  Since I avoid sweet meat, I avoid Silver Dragon. Users/JaimeRaba jr

I went to this place with a group of friends. We ordered several dishes to share. The food was pretty good until we found a lengthy black hair near the bottom of our chowmain dish. As if the discovery of the repulsive hair was not tramatic enough, when my friends and I reported the problem to our waitress, she actually suggested that the hair might be one of OURS. After that I swore I would never return to Silver Dragon. Users/SiennaGrass

20050705 16:09:52 nbsp Some of my friends love this place, but I think its gross.  I know someone who found a huge beetle (Id hate to say cockroach without knowing for certain, but...) in his food, and the guy who owns/runs the restaurant creeps me out. Users/SummerSong

20050706 18:40:02 nbsp I think alot of the claims against Silver Dragon are nonesense. the food is delicious, the Employees are always there to help you with anything (once i spilled a glass of water on the floor, and the waiter jumped up with a smile to tell me it was okay and that he would get it) and in regards to the food, it may not be authentic as far as chinese goes, but then again, think what chinese restaurant in davis is?

This comment made me laugh out loud.  Users/Rocksanddirt

20050708 23:37:52 nbsp I thought it was pretty weird that when you order the mushu pork, the guy actually comes to your table, wraps it up, and throws it on your plate for you. Not a one time thing, he does it all the time.  I end up grabbing the spoon for the sauce as soon as its on the table so that I can start before he does. Maybe its the fact that he uses his bare hands, ich.  I used to eat here a lot before I went on to other Chinese places, the food was always decent. Not good, sometimes weird, but thankfully never any beetles or hair.   Service isnt god awful but its definitly mediocre.   Users/EdWins ES

My parents and I enjoy eating at Silver Dragon. The price isnt that bad and the food is great. I recommend the Hot and Sour soup. Users/SimonFung

20050827 15:32:15 nbsp I like this place because its good for takeout. Eating in you get to experience different groups of people (who are mature, immature, etc) and different levels of service. I dont really reccomend eating there alone; their individual portions are not really up to par. But Im not sure their food is any better or worse than say, Hunan, where the atmosphere is better. SS

20051015 20:30:17 nbsp I think Silver Dragon is an excellent restaurant with very good food. The staff is very nice.  Users/MaggieBlank

20051112 00:36:40 nbsp My husband and I have two favorite Chinese Food places in town, and this is one of them. The silver dragon is great because the waiters dont bother you every 5 minutes with food in your mouth. The food is plentiful and quite delicious, as well as cheap. The setting may not be as atmospheric as a lot of people would like, but who really cares? I go there for good food, not to stare at wallpaper. Users/TarynHornen

20051119 15:04:19 nbsp I really wish they didnt spill more water on the table then they pour into your cup.  They pour it so fast from filled pitchers that it drips and splashes everywhere. If you place your cup away from the tables edge, youll even get water in your plate.  Every single time nomatter who the server is for the last 2 or 3 years.  Part of why I said the service is mediocre at best.   Oh, and before I said the guy does the mooshu wrap stuff for you  last time I tried to do it myself he actually halfyelled at me to stop.  But I think the food is alright for the price, so we still go.  Just dont Tipping tip much.  Users/EdWins ES

20060111 16:05:28 nbsp Well I have been going to Silver Dragon for 13yrs now and have never found an unwelcome thig/stuff in my food.  The walnut shrimp and cheese wontons are GREAT.  If you ever have a cold I highly recommend the Hot & Soup soup.  All of the food is pretty cheap and pretty good. Users/MichiePal

20060214 15:30:13 nbsp Pretty bad. I guess its edible though. Of course, I cant help but think of the smell of the alley right next to the front door. Its one of those smells that makes you throw up a little in your mouth. YUM! Users/RyanLeverenz

20060224 09:39:35 nbsp I like this place.  The lunch specials really fill my belly for less than $6.  Ive eaten here a dozen times or more and havent seen a hair or a bug in my food. Users/SteveGreen

20060317 19:56:49 nbsp FKEN PISSED!!! I understand that it was a busy hour. But how come they pack for others but not my table? I guess its becasue people at my table looked young... We called them for bills and packing, and I swear to god that they were ignoring us to serve others first. For freaken 15mins!!! Even though we asked for service first!! When paying the bill, they asked us to go to the front and pay whereas they takecare of other peoples bill and bring it to their table. I mean, their food has always sucked, but I went back once a while because of the proximity. But with this kind of treatment? FK NO!! Also, You want to try Monglian Beef Soup? Go here... (Never seen Monglian Beef with so much water!!) _; Users/JoyJoy

20060320 01:10:19 nbsp What sort of chinese joint has a stash of chopsticks in plain view but doesnt even offer the Chinese customers chopsticks?  The food was not horribly salty but the meats were strangely fried and somewhat gooey.  I wasnt feeling very good after eating dinner there the other day.  As for atmosphere, for much of the time we were there, a middle aged guy(manager, perhaps) seemed to be ranting at the waitress.  They were pretty nice to the customers for the most part but told a guy whos been at UCD for a few years to get a job. Users/MarieHuynh

20060508 23:55:52 nbsp I have always had great food at Silver Dragon. Their orange chicken rice plate is my favorite. With the exception of one brusk waiter, the staff is extremely friendly. Users/EliseKane

20060525 22:32:32 nbsp P.S. Once found a hair in the food, but cmon, thats very hard to prevent. I mean, hairs get in things. Its not going to hurt you. Unless it was a rat hair (which most likely wont hurt somebody either), I think it wasnt a big deal. Ive gone to Silver Dragon several times and even took my parents there once when they visited Davis. The portions have been huge; you get more than you pay for. The owner is amiable and jokes around, but is not intrusive. A good ol family restaurant. Users/EliseKane

Users/DanielWorthington

20070302 14:06:26 nbsp Silver Dragon was recommended by one of my husbands professors at UCD. Its great! Weve never had any problems there at all. I think the food is very good and inexpensive. We have always had great service there. Its a lowkey family place. My favorite dishes are the Sweet n Sour Pork, and a pea dish they have, name escapes me at the moment. Give it a try! Users/PatrickRogers

20070424 12:03:06 nbsp If you get there after 8 pm, the owners favorite joke is to pretend that its too late and that hes about to close his restaurant.  And he does this to 4 out of 5 customers who approach.  Its very amusing to watch.  Hes a very happy, loud, friendly guy who will tell you to enjoy your Spaghetti as he puts down your plate of beef with broccolli.
 Users/StudentRuby

20070429 18:44:04 nbsp Silver Dragon has the best Hot and Sour Soup around these here parts. I think its the best Hot and Sour soup Ive ever had. The place is totally affordable and the customer service is really good there, as Ive had very jovial experiences with some of the waiters and the owner. I once complimented one of the waiters on his shirt, as it was a different color from everyone elses and he said it was his work shirt when he used to work at a casino! :) Users/ArielaHaro

20071014 03:51:01 nbsp Davis Cops love this place.  Must be the diner atmosphere. Users/JeffShaw

20071121 21:09:19 nbsp Silver Dragons cuisine is certainly Americanized (though outside of SF, LA or the rare place in Sac, whose isnt?), but its pretty tasty, our service was very fast and polite, and the portions were quite good.  Did I say good?  I meant to say utterly absurd (in a good way).  We got the Family Dinner for two and were served enough food for 5soup, egg rolls, wantons, chow mein, sweet and sour chicken and cashew chicken. Any of the last three could have fed my wife and myself on their own.  Admittedly, none of it was exceptional, but it was all good enough to look forward to the week or so of leftovers that we took away from it.   Users/RyanSandler

20071121 23:05:50 nbsp As Jason notes, it looks like a diner because it WAS a diner, long before it was Silver Dragon. Ive been eating there for decades. Good food, reasonable prices, friendly service, very consistent over the years. Great Hot and Sour Soup. A pleasant place to take visitors.

20080415 18:43:29 nbsp The sesame chicken was delicious until we uncovered the giant bug, but that might have been what made it delicious. edit: I forgot to add, he didnt comp the check, they just took half off and offered to replace the sesame chicken. Users/SamanthaA

20080503 10:02:33 nbsp I have eaten at Silver Dragon many times over the past few years while in Davis  sometimes as many as four times per month. My friends and I always looked forward to being served by Sam who is friendly and outgoing so it wasnt always the food that brought us back. The food has always been good and tasty and remarkably inexpensive.

During the past year, however, I have noted a disappointing change in attitude by the owners. I challenged the bill one time as it seemed way too high even for a party of four (they write your order in chinese and just put a total on the bill rather than itemizing items as in most restaurants) When I had him ring up each item seperately on the register, it turned out that our server (not Sam) had tacked on an extra five bucks. Begrudgingly he adjusted the bill. No tip that day!

Things went well for a while and we even added the tip we didnt leave before to Sams tip since he treats us so well.  Then we ate there around noon one day and I ordered General Chicken, my usual. To my dismay it was cooked poorly (practically raw inside and gummy outside)and I just ate the chow mein which is always very good. I told the manager who rang us up that I wasnt pleased (I would have sent it back but the non Sam server never even came back to the table and we were in a hurry) and his reaction was we cant please everyone.

This past week however was an even worse experience and our last straw. My friend and I had stopped in around 3pm for a late lunch and found the place practically deserted. The staff was all seated around a large circular table eating so we just seated ourselves. Eventually some guy must have finished eating and came over and dropped two menus on the table. We ordered when the owner finally came by. A totally different person came by and practically dropped the plate on the table and walked away without a word.

The mood of the staff was somber and grim and not at all cheerful (where were you Sam!) There was only one other customer eating alone and soon left.  We ate quickly and I went to the counter to pay since they never seem to bring your check around to the table anymore. The owner took my cash and gave me change. I asked him what was up and he basically said if I didnt like the service then go eat somewhere else!

OK, we will! From what I saw and experienced, I wouldnt be surprised to see them closing their doors soon.  Maybe the economic downturn is affecting them.

Now we meet at Hunan where the food is always excellent and the service fine.  The food is more expensive but the atmosphere is worth it.

Good luck to you Sam!  Thanks for all your funny banter!

If theres no asian people eating at an asian restaurant.. THEN ITS NOT GOOD. Users/2point0student
  Well, not good to Asian people. But its still good to me because I dont have stringent home cooking expectations for Asian food. This place has been open for a looong time. They must be doing something right. At least for the white American palette. Users/OscarSabino

20080925 07:14:08 nbsp Using that logic, if no Germans or Polish people are eating at Hotdogger, then it must suck. Faulty logic. Plus, on a more basic level, Asians do eat there. So, argument null and void. Users/DCWine

20081108 15:29:56 nbsp Ive always had an okay experience at Silver Dragon until today.  Today I ate the hot and sour soup, and when I was done, I removed the bowl so that I could use the small plate for sauce.  Underneath my cup were four very alive squirmy baby roaches.  I was appalled and disgusted, and when I complained, they quickly took the bowl away and apologized.  However, they charged me for my meal, even though I ate less than half of it because I lost my appetite!  I will never return here again. Users/DiLane

20081113 13:13:01 nbsp I ate at Silver Dragon for dinner with a friend. We got their $9 dinner special, which consisted of wonton soup, fried egg rolls, chicken chow mein, sweet/sour pork, and a chicken dish. The portions were huge (more than enough for 2 people) and the food was okay. The total bill came to a $11 split, not exactly affordable but considering you are getting a soup, appetizer, and 3 dishes, plus some extras for take home, it aint bad.  Users/justinhu

20090315 18:54:41 nbsp Silver Dragon is definitely hit or miss. I love the authentic taste and the authentic service (Which is also hit or miss; the service I experienced in Beijing was about the same). The location is pretty prime, and its a really solid place to hit if youre just roaming around downtown aimlessly. Ive tried pretty much all the Chinese restaurants in Davis in my 6 years here so far, and Silver Dragon is a perennial favorite. Im not sure about these claims about roaches and unsanitary stuff, aside from the fact that sometimes when soups being served, the server touches his thumb to the soup. No big deal if his hands are washed regularly.  Users/Aggieanthony

20100626 23:55:41 nbsp I used to really like this place, but I dont think I will ever go back. They have good portions and awesome lunch combos. I really like their noodles, appetizers, and kung pao shrimp. The other day I had the worst service I have ever had, I got a hair in my food, and one of the employees was clipping his fingernails in the dining room. My friend told me he got a hair in his food a couple weeks ago, but I didnt care. Now I do. This hair was buried deep within my delicious kung pao shrimp, hidden between peanuts and peppers, only to be discovered once in my mouth. Deciding whether to swallow or not after I removed the hair was a tough decision, but I totally spit it out and left. Users/reviewaskew

20100703 19:19:52 nbsp Pretty much on par with most of the Chinese in Davis, similar menu. Im not as fond of the atmosphere as I am at House of Chang but I was satisfied. Also, it just so happens that one of my previous favorite dishes at my aforementioned regular spot was the vanilla walnut shrimp. Im not a huge shrimp fan but I love that dish and when one of my friends ordered the same thing with chicken at Silver Dragon I nearly died. Its wonderfully addicting.
Otherwise, service was quick and friendly and the food was eaten quickly, so I dont see a trouble with this.

Also to the bemoaners... French fries arent French but that argument was given up long ago. Authenticity doesnt matter but for the sake of variety, so I always prioritize taste and value. This fits the bill so Im not about to complain. If you want authentic Chinese food have someones Chinese mother make it for you. You know what I mean, yes. Users/KBathory

20100807 09:17:22 nbsp Not discounting allegations from others, but Ive probably eaten at Silver Dragon hundreds of times in my 15 years here, and have never encountered anything but food on my plate.

If you look at the back of the red chairs... there is still a steer head on them. Anyone know for sure what that restaurant was called before Silver Dragon? Users/LouisM

20100816 13:10:41 nbsp I always used to eat at the Silver Dragon. There walnut shrimp was truly addicting and their hot and sour soup wasnt too bad. But the service was another issue. Whenever I went there they would slam the plates down, never smile and if I asked for anything (more water, another napkin, etc.) the waiters and waitresses wouldnt give any acknowledgement of the fact that they heard and would hardly follow through with the product. And it wasnt only me who was treated like, so were my friends.
The last straw was when my parents came to town. My dad was seated, and waited patiently until the food was served. he then asked if he could have some chopsticks, the manager was serving us as they were short on staff that day. The manager turns towards my father and tells him in a rude voice that he would have to hold on as he, the manager, was too busy to get chopsticks at the moment. My father then asked if a waiter could get the chopsticks. At this point the manager walks away without even a verbal confirmation. In the end, I had to get up to get the chopsticks myself for both my parents. I would go to this restaurant at least once a week. But due to their bipolar nature, I have now stopped. There are much better, more authentic, cheaper Chinese places that people can go to. This place has bad decor, bad service, bad management and even an even worse location. At first I thought that their food was really good, and I could learn to ignore their rude behavior, but after I stopped going to the place I realized that there are restaurants with much better food out there and better service. Save your money and your time, dont go to the Silver Dragon. Horrible place. Users/shehzadihamid


20100922 17:15:24 nbsp I used to be a regular here and the owner, Sam, would always top my food with something extra. I remember once when I ordered take out, he said to me Lots of food here. Youre going to be eating Chinese food for three days! And yeah, he was right. Users/DaveKHuh

20110118 20:21:50 nbsp Went to Silver Dragon for dinner on a Tuesday night, not too many people inside. Liked the decor, the red booths were cute ) The service was very good; nice people, quick, and attentive (yet not overly so). The Eggplant Pork in Hot Garlic Sauce I ordered was a large portion, and quite tasty. My roommate ordered the Vegetable Deluxe which was pretty good as well. We also ordered Fried Wontons as an appetizer, which I dont recommend getting, as theyre essentially fried wonton wrappers (nothing else!) with a sweet dipping sauce. Overall, a good place to go for cheap Chineseish food. Users/KTruong

20110203 20:26:33 nbsp Overall pretty good food, again like with most chinese restaurants in Davis you get what you pay for. For some reason they only had 1 waiter working this evening when I went, and the entire restaurant was packed so needless to say service was slow. If you dont mind waiting for a little while its not that bad. I asked to substitute the hot and sour soup for egg flower soup and the waiter wouldnt let me because the hot and sour is already made. I am assuming all the soups are made so that was the only downside. A LOT of food, I recommend the steamed rice plates. We got the crab and cheese wontons which were really good also. I probably prefer wok of flame, but I would say silver dragon is similar to hunans in quality and price.  Users/cj2012aggie

20110207 14:40:27 nbsp By far the worst Chinese food Ive eaten here in Davis. Food sucks! Users/kumi

20110228 19:25:39 nbsp I got the letter J lunch special for takeout last Friday. The general chicken, chow mein, and egg roll were good but it was the fried rice that I really liked. It was moist and tasty unlike at some other Chinese restaurants where it’s hard and dry. I also got some crab cheese wontons which, while good, could not beat Ding How’s (the best!).

This was the first time in a long while that I’d been back to Silver Dragon. I used to go pretty often and never had any problems with the food (i.e finding foreign objects in it). Then I stopped going because of some of the reviews on here, plus one waiter (although nice) was/is a little creepy and overly friendly with young Asian female diners, esp. if you dine in alone.

20110804 15:38:03 nbsp This was one of the first real restaurants in Davis, back when there were maybe 5 downtown... used to be a steak house (as others mentioned), thus the furniture.  Were talking late 70s here... its been a Chinese place for like 35 years.  Im trying to remember what the heck the place was called... Ill consult some folks and check back.  Users/OldDavis73

20110805 09:25:42 nbsp OK, this place was originally called Peking Chinese restaurant.  I want to say it changed some time in the 90s... anyway, it was 1 of only 3 real restaurants in Davis back then (mid to late 70s).  Everything else was sandwiches or Pizza: Larry Blakes, AJ Bumps, and this place (again, used to be a Texas steak place). Users/OldDavis73
  What, how could you forget Honorable Gees?! Users/DonShor
        and the Branding Iron  Users/SueHjerpe

20110806 13:20:27 nbsp My apologies for the omissions, I was relaying what my folks told me was in town back in 74.  I do however remember Honorable Gees (wrote about it on the Library arcade page), and the constant Buddah theft... where/what was the Branding Iron? Users/OldDavis73
       The Branding Iron was a restaurant owned by the Belenis family that became Mr. Bs.  I remember eating there in the mid 1960s.  No apology need for not remembering that. Users/SueHjerpe

20120201 10:20:47 nbsp I had such a disgusting experience at Silver Dragon. As an undergrad, I loved the won ton soup and ate at Silver Dragon on a regular basis. Then I took my boyfriend here for a date...when I was eating my sweet and sour chicken, I felt something weird hanging from my mouth. It was a WAD of long black hair that had been in my chicken. Not a single hair. A wad of hair. And it was partially in my mouth with my food. I was so disgusted and traumatized. We showed it to the waiter and he took that one plate off of the bill. UGH. I would never go to Silver Dragon again. That still remins my most awful restaurant experience. When I told my friend about it afterward, he said, Yeah...Ive seen things like that on the Davis Wiki for the restaurant. So those of you wondering if these stories are true...I believe every one of them. Disgusting!!! Users/KellyElmore

20120317 16:03:51 nbsp love this place. service is always, always excellent. the workers are very genuine and kind here. thats what makes them so special. also, the food here is great. their chow fun is good and their mongolian beef is the best ive had in davis so far.  Users/SallyVo

20120811 01:40:46 nbsp My favorite Chinese place in Davis, hands down. Its cheap and delicious. Their lunch specials are an especially good deal  sweet & sour soup, main course, rice (fried or steamed), and an egg roll for about $67 depending on what you order. Service is also always on point, although sometimes I think theyre too attentive on the waterrefill. Im always waited on by the flushedlooking waiter, and hes always nice (though a little odd at first)! Whenever I go, we always got free fruit. I thought it was a Silver Dragon thing, but it turns out that its not. Its he waiter! It was another one of Davis cruel summer days (106F), and my friend and I got free watermelon and cantaloupe. The watermelon was so sweet. The waiter asked us if we wanted more, and I asked if it costed anything. He said no; he owned all the watermelon and cut slices for customers because he wants to. So he gave us more. I was so pleased I wanted to tip him more, but he wouldnt take it. After, he came around a third time and gave us each a chunk of watermelon to take home, telling me that I had better put my wallet away (I wanted to tip extra) or else he would take back his offer. His generosity was so nice. My friend and I left happy, full (we also could not finished the meal we bought), and excited for the next time we would go. Recommended! Users/DianaNguyen

20121119 15:00:14 nbsp Their salt and pepper pork is about the same as I remember from more authentic places, but the ma po tofu isnt very good. I think they try to get away with ingredients that people unaccustomed to Chinese food dont know dont really belong in certain dishes. I mean, I stick with the pork and hot and sour soup so Im not really ever disappointed.  Users/HannahToru

20121201 19:45:33 nbsp The best Chinese food in Davis!!! I have lived here for 4 years and have found no place with better food or service. The employees and owners are always very friendly and work to make sure my friends and I have had a full and satisfying meal. The Mandarin Spicy Chicken, Curry Chicken and Hot and Sour Soup are amazing and rich with flavor and not overloaded with grease or salt like other places (like Hometown Chinese Food...terrible).    Users/Abdiver17

20131210 14:09:55 nbsp Best hot and sour and Wor wonton soup in town.  Service is always super good and very friendly. Users/LokiAbbi

20140102 18:03:35 nbsp Best hot and sour soup around. This is standard Chinese food for the American palate, and I find the sauces generally more flavorful than Hunan, the other big fish in the downtown Davis food scene. The waitstaff is sociable and Ive had a few good gabfests with them during lunch. A nice casual, tasty dining experience!
 Users/LilyS

I just want to agree with Lily  The hot N Sour is the best around to my palate. I try it everywhere I go and nothing gets the job as well as the soup from silver dragon Daubert
