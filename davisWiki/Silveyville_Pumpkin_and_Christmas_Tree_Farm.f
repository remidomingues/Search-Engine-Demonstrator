They have precut Christmas trees, and trees to choose and cut down yourself (they provide the saw). Most of the choose and cut trees are Monterey Pine, but they also have Scotch Pine, Incense Cedar and Leyland Cypress. Douglas Fir and Noble Fir trees are precut only. They recommend calling first to confirm which trees are available. They offer free hot apple cider and free popcorn to their guests. There are sleigh rides with Santa Claus for $1 per person. There is a small store which carries ornaments, clocks and fun Christmas decorations; you can also purchase mistletoe and wreaths, or boughs to make your own wreath.
