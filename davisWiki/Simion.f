Simion always wears sunglasses.

20071004 14:41:49 nbsp hey simion, while we may not agree with the commercial aspects of the bike barn, I think it is still appropriate for the bike church, and the ministers, to support other bike efforts in town. if you dont like the bike barn dont go there, or tell people not to go there in person. telling the bike barn to fuck off and trying to get people to go to the bike church in the same comment is a conflict of interest and kinda lame in my opinion.
