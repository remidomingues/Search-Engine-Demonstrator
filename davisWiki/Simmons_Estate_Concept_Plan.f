The City of Davis Community Development Department will be hosting a http://www.ci.davis.ca.us/story/?storySimmons_Estate_Visioning_Workshops visioning process for the Sunrise Farm Simmons Estate, an undeveloped 12acre site on 8th Street East Eight Street, adjacent to the Davis Cemetery.

This includes three evening workshops on September 17th, 18th and 20th at the Fred T. Korematsu Elementary School, and an open design studio in the community room of the Walnut Terrace Apartments at 3101 5th Street.

Your participation will ensure that a broad crosssection of the community is involved in the planning process, which is crucial for the creation of a shared vision for development of the site.


20070904 20:40:44 nbsp Did the City buy the property? Users/JasonAller

20070904 21:41:12 nbsp I dont believe the ownership has left the family... although the http://www.ci.davis.ca.us/story/pdfs/Simmons_Estate_Flyer_3.pdf announcement flyer doesnt make that clear. Any change from the current agricultural use and zoning would take planning approvals. It isnt plausible that the owners could get those approvals without something close to accord  so the Planning Department decided (or was directed?) to be proactive. I have also been told by a former Sunrise Farm resident that a change would require a Measure J vote, though the land is already within City limits. Users/DougWalter

20070904 21:47:38 nbsp So if someone were to buy the place and build a single family residence on it and use the rest for some manner of agricultural use there wouldnt be any need for input from the community? Users/JasonAller

20080430 01:06:28 nbsp To answer your question, Jason, the city gets to approve or deny any development plan for the property, whether its one singlefamily residence or a 120unit multifamily development. Whether they own it doesnt matter. The city has to accept public comment, but I think its pretty much up to them what that means. In Davis it usually means having lots of public meetings and discussions.

And to address Dougs comment, a Measure J vote is not required because the property is not designated as agricultural land on the citys land use map. In fact, it is zoned as residential highdensity.
