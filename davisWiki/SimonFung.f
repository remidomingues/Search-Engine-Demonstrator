I graduated from UC Davis with a bachelor degree in Managerial Economics. It took me awhile to figure out what I wanted to do. I was initially majoring in Electrical Engineering, but during my second year I decided to change majors.

When I was still at Davis, I visited the DavisWiki to edit entries or to view the recent changes. I am glad there is a DavisWiki because it has helped me know more about UC Davis, Davis and the community.

I moved back to East Bay Area and now work in San Francisco. I am also on https://sf.localwiki.org/Users/SimonFung SF Wiki.

I visit Davis once or twice a year and do minor editing and commenting on new changes in Davis. I sometimes add my perspective from the 4 years I was in Davis.



WHAT?!?! what mix is it, and since when has DISC had the machine?  Users/StevenDaubert

20100727 12:45:59 nbsp Hi Simon.  Yea, I work for CLM where management is currently trying to set up a marketing team to raise awareness around Davis and campus about the services we offer.  Ill mainly be working on the Davis wiki pages along with one of my coworkers.  We have a lot of work to do.  I will be updating/creating MU/SciLab/Olson/Hutch (coworker doing the other labs) pages along with more general CLM pages, such as tips for printing and other helpful information.  Hopefully by the end of summer itll be all set up and updated. Users/NateCRC

20100730 16:30:37 nbsp OK, cool.  Thanks for that.  Users/MasonMurray

20100813 23:42:04 nbsp I really like that idea too :) we just need a tall ladder. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20101121 00:49:23 nbsp Hey Simon, I agree that its a cool idea... Im just not sure its ever likely to happen.  If you want, though, feel free to revert to a predeletion version of the page.  Oftentimes the thing that really gets a page going is simple attention, and a reversion can sometimes be enough to bring that.  Its the sort of page that requires a lot of updating, but weve got others that are a fair amount of work that are currently going strong (e.g. Arriving Businesses).  If you want to try to get the Davis Statistics page going, by all means, please do!  I was just cleaning up, since it had been pretty thoroughly abandoned previously. Users/TomGarberson

20110117 22:53:21 nbsp Whoops, thanks for catching the date on Picnic Day 2011! Users/TomGarberson

20110519 15:20:48 nbsp Yep!  Its all their regular beers, plus a couple of their Beer Camp products, whatever theyve been playing with in the experimental brewery.  They had an amazing black IPA when we were there. Users/TomGarberson

20110523 19:35:15 nbsp Unfortunately, most of the other wikispot wikis are really underdeveloped.  Where a page has Davis perspective / Davis relevance, it deserves a page, or at least a section of a page here on DW.  For example, Bay to Breakers probably deserves a writeup, since probably a couple hundred Davisites go each year.  Advice, transportation, general information, what have you.  By contrast, individual restaurants probably dont deserve much of a writeup beyond some special mentions on a page about things to do in SF.  Crosswiki links for that sort of thing are probably a good approach.

And, of course, if you want to put in some real work on the SF wiki, thatd be awesome. Users/TomGarberson

20110524 15:09:49 nbsp That page looks great!  Hipster beach is hilarious. Users/TomGarberson

20110526 16:44:17 nbsp Thanks for working on the New Coffee House page.  It looks like there are some objections to splitting it off, but your work is definitely appreciated!  We can see about differentiating content on the Coffee House page between pre and postrenovation a lot better.  You got things rolling beautifully, so thank you! Users/TomGarberson

20120203 04:51:50 nbsp Yep, the Beer Shoppe is pretty laid back I think. Earlier today, I saw two guys bringing in sub sandwiches and another guy was eating a salad (salad and beer seems like kind of a weird combo, but hey, who am I to judge.) Another time, some people were eating Woodstocks pizza, which was interesting to see since they are sort of a competitor! Users/ScottMeehleib

20120304 21:53:57 nbsp The Internet Archive does a fantastic job of being a library of digital information.  If you never knew about the various services it provides, they are worth going through.  Digital books, archives of concerts and speeches, etc. Users/JabberWokky

20120423 16:36:30 nbsp Yes, thanks so much for contributing your photos! Users/CovertProfessor

20121018 23:44:38 nbsp Hey, I noticed you added Instagram to the Social Websites entry.  You might want to add a note about the Davis relevance.  All the others link to entries that explain the sites relation to Davis, with the exception of one, where I tried to add the relevance in a note. Users/JabberWokky

20121019 00:00:50 nbsp Oh, I assume its relevant.  I only asked you about it because I dont use it and have no idea what the relevance is.  I figure Im probably not alone.  Is there a Davis tag or some kind of geomapping thing to find local pictures? Users/JabberWokky

20140709 15:48:26 nbsp Ha!  I saw that Persian page when it was created, but I was interwiki gnoming and somehow mentally thought it was on a wiki by itself.  Thanks for removing the spam! Users/JabberWokky
