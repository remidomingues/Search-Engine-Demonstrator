The Single Parent Support Group provides both parent education and a format for group discussion. Co led by psychologist and former single parent Jennie Singer PhD, and psychotherapist Milton Kalish LCSW, the group offers parent education related to single parenting, divorce, children of divorce, and adjustment to post divorce family life.  Guest speakers will be scheduled as well.  Our sliding scale fee is based on ability to pay.

We are in the process of developing a  Childrens Support Groups Support Group, which will be led by Mara Newbart LCSW.  The group will offer a playful setting in which children of divorce are supported in the realization that they are not alone, and can express their feelings naturally through art and play materials.   Healthy snacks will be provided.  The two groups will meet concurrently, so there will be no need to arrange for outside childcare.

The Rising Suns program gives parents time to receive meditation instruction and meditate while their children enjoy outdoor activities in a loving environment.  As parents, one of the best ways we can help our children is to take care of ourselves.
