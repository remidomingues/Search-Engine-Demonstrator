Single Transferable Vote is the technical name for a Voting voting system known locally and more commonly as Choice Voting.  Preference Voting is yet another name.  Single Transferable Voting can be used in both singlewinner and multiwinner elections.  In multiwinner elections, it is a system of proportional representation.  For singlewinner elections, it reduces to the system more commonly known as Instant Runoff Voting.
