http://pallas.telperion.info I am a knight of the Order of Telperion: probably the coolest knight on campus. Ive never done anything with the Campus Crusade for Chaos and Confusion  they probably dont even exist! I do hang out in Kemper Hall a lot, and have something to do with Team Aggie Spirit.


Once in awhile I do things with the Newman Center or Alpha Gamma Omega. Only ASUCD the gods know why.

I am definitely a member of Well Known Secret.
