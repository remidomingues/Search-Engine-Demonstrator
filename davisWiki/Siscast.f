http://siscast.com Siscast.com is a class planner that started out for UC Davis students. They have review lists of classes and  teachers and a textbook lookup function.  They now have support for a few universities across the country (although most other schools now have outdated class info), and expanded features, such as Find me a GE in:, letting you choose which type and whether its upper or lower division.   Siscast class planner offers you some flexibility in picking courses, letting you choose when you want your earliest class to begin, or your latest to end, if you dont want labs or classes on certain days of the week, or if you want to look up only courses that are still open for registration. You can also purchase textbooks through siscast.  Siscast was started in fall of 2003 by Arjan Dehar, Kevin Widjaja and Users/SeanRegan. As of 2010 Siscast is no longer available.

20060326 01:10:49 nbsp it was better when it was simple and straight forward. simplify siscast, please? Users/AdamGerber
  What do you find unstraightforward about it? All the new features they added are optional.  Users/TravisGrathwell

20070206 20:02:18 nbsp This resource should really be advertised more and should have more publicity, I am sure that not enough people know about this great tool.  I was looking everywhere for something that would do the same thing; I wish I knew about it sooner. Users/SidGhodke

20070206 21:05:30 nbsp I use Siscast for all my registration worries and I see people around me with their registration books trying to plan a schedule...poor uninformed kids. Users/GregWebb

20100209 18:59:06 nbsp Never works for me, it does not include my classes, or at least never more than one. A shame, this is really needed. UCD really needs to chenge the registration system, its beyond stupid. Users/amesguich

20100210 21:50:48 nbsp For some reason, Siscast has not been updated for Spring 2010 Users/JeffKwong

20100508 18:55:48 nbsp It makes me sad that current students will never know firsthand the wonders of Siscast. I wish I had it to plan out my first quarter.... playing around with the registration guide was simply too cumbersome. As you progress and your classes get smaller, it becomes less and less useful. But this was a godsend for me lower division. Users/WilliamLewis

20100512 22:50:46 nbsp So, is Siscast dead forever?  Users/JenniferGiang

20100826 17:54:39 nbsp yeah, wtf is up, man? I heard rumors that siscast was up again but i cant find it Users/MattCorey

20100908 02:21:29 nbsp So there is a siscast: http://seanregan.com/siscast3/siscast2.1.html, but it doesnt seem to work.  Users/HarrisonM
