This is the central place for resources that help keep the wiki wellorganized.

 Making the wiki wellorganized/good on a global scale 

  Recent Changes  Shows all changes in the wiki.  Of course, youve got to know about Recent Changes.  This is the granddaddy of them all.
  Lame Wiki Pages  Lists pages identified by users as needing help.  Some are stubs, some are confusing, and some are just unsalvagably lame.

 Keeping the wiki welllinked 
  Wanted Pages  Shows all links that arent yet pages.
  Orphaned Pages  Pages that are not linked to from anywhere.
  Outgoing Links  Ranks all pages based on the number of links on them.  A page with 0 links is a dead end!
  Seed Pages List  Lists pages in need of content.

 Page Flags 
Some pages are flagged with the Includes Include macro to mark them as:
  {{{Include(Seed)}}} to marks the page as a Seed with a link to edit the page.
  {{{Include(PhotoRequest)}}} to marks the page as a Photo Requests photo request
  {{{Include(IntegrateComments)}}} to mark the page as needed cleanup/comment integration
  {{{Include(FactCheck)}}} to mark the page as needing a fact checked, can be used right near the statement
  {{{Include(NoLongerExists)}}} For pages or subjects that no longer exist (preferably, use the Departed Business flag instead)
  {{{include(Relevance)}}} to mark pages apparently not related to Davis
  {{{include(UCDCentric)}}} to mark pages written only from a UCD perspective
  {{{Include(Copy/Paste)}}} For pages that are obviously copied/pasted from another website
  {{{Include(HIPAA Restrictions)}}} For pages about doctors of medical personnel
  {{{Include(Departed Business)}}} to mark departed businesses
  {{{Include(Advert)}}} to mark a page that sounds like an advertisement
  All the other flags are two words, make one word? Users/ArlenAbraham

 Joke Flags 
Some Wikizens get a kick out of making and/or using these.

  {{{Include(ambiguation)}}} A parody of the Disambiguation flag (which doesnt actually exist on this wiki).  Mainly used as a flag for Lame Wiki Pages
  {{{include(realdavis)}}} for pages that actually have something to do with Davis
  {{{Include(Apathy)}}} to...whatever...
  {{{Include(CitationNeeded)}}} Another parody of wikipedia, for use when people try to enforce NPOV here

 Misc metrics 
  X Page Size  Shows list of pages ranked by size.  Gives indication of how much content there is. X
   Disabled/Broken.  See Friends Urging Campus Kindness Platform for details.
  All Pages  Autogenerated master list of all pages in the wiki.
  Random Page

 Making individual pages better organized 

If you have a lot of headings (which you should  theyre great for breaking up big pages!), {{{TableOfContents}}} will generate a table of contents for the page based on the headlines in the page (play with it).

So that means, given the current headlines on this page, if I do {{{TableOfContents}}}, I get:


and those are links to those sections in the text.  Nifty!
