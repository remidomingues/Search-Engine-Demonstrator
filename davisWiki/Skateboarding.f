Much of the skateboarding in Davis happens at the Public Skate Park.  Technically, skateboarding is illegal on the sidewalks downtown, as the stenciled warnings will remind you. Skateboarding is also specifically outlawed in Central Park and around the Senior Center.

Although grinding and reckless skating are officially prohibited on the campus UC Davis campus, such rules dont stop the school from being another popular destination for advanced skaters and even pros. One sevenstep rail has become relatively wellknown among hardcore skate fans, and several pros have been known to grind it when visiting the area. http://www.youtube.com/watch?vAkjrweWy0Gc Heres a YouTube clip of local pro Nyjah Huston taking it on.  Other locations that people often skate at include the steps in front of Physics and Geology, Chemistry Building, and Bainer Hall. One can also find skaters hanging out around Central Park, despite the ordinance that prohibits skating there.

Much of the hate for skaters comes from how they can destroy property when they wax edges and grind on things that werent meant to be ground on. Therefore some would prefer that skaters keep their grinds to the skate park even if it means stifling creative uses for mostly pointless and ugly architectural elements. Of course, grinding on and waxing these ugly architectural elements makes them even uglier, pissing off property owners and people who dislike eyesores, perhaps inducing even stupider laws against skateboarding.

Skateboarding and longboarding (longboards tend to have larger wheels that handle cracks and rocks better) are popular alternatives to Bicycling biking around town. Boarding is maybe not as fast as biking, but its often overlooked as another practical and green form of transportation. For some of the folks who are carfree in Davis, skateboarding serves as a primary form of transportation. Since skateboards are not allowed on the downtown sidewalks, some skaters opt to use the bike lanes instead.

You can also skate down the Bike Paths, but be cautious, especially at night.  Most of them are cracked open due to old age or tree roots.

Ground Zero is the only respectable skateboard store in town. It is the only local shop where you can buy individual parts, maintenance supplies, and custommade boards.  Big 5 Sporting Goods sells some complete boards, but they are almost all of terrible quality. With the exception of some deals found online, one should assume that any new skateboard under $50 is utter trash.

West Coast Crush is a shop in the County Fair Mall (Woodland) that carries Surf, Skate, BMX and other things connected to that life.

There was a Davis Skate Society composed of UC Davis students, but they appear to be mostly dormant these days except for the occasional reunion.

Local pro skaters include Eric Brockman and Nyjah Huston.



And for some reason, cops will stop you from skating in the empty The Marketplace Marketplace parking lots at night, claiming that it is illegal to skate anywhere in Davis. He was in an unmarked car too.

According to Section 6.02.050 of the Davis Municipal Code, skateboarding outdoors on most publicly used private properties (such as business parking lots) is, by default, legal. In areas where skateboarding has been deemed unsafe by the city manager, property owners are required to post conspicuous signs stating that skateboarding is prohibited.

Some businesses are not cool with having skateboards upon their premises at all, even if they are being carried continuously, strapped onto backpacks, or tucked away in any other discreet manner. Businesses that are not skateboardfriendly should be listed here.
