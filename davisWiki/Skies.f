Many people have pictures of the Davis skies or may have seen some interesting things flying around. Go ahead and add them!

Skies have lots of weather stuffed into them.  Theyre darker during night time than some cities, due to the city Light Ordinance.

20071218 23:40:07 nbsp From now through the end of January, you can get a great view of Mars, directly overhead.  Thanks to the Light Ordinance you can see it nicely from in town.  It wont be this close to the earth again until 2016.   Users/CovertProfessor

20080409 21:43:35 nbsp Davis has too many street lights! Not only do we have too many street lights, we have the worst of the worst light polluters.  We were told it was too expensive to retrofit but any new lights would point their light down instead of sideways and up into the sky.  Then we built the gasoline friendly, let out teenagers drive to school, parking lot.  Those are new lights and they are not night friendly.  We are one of the worst light polluters around.  West Sacramento has night friendly street lightsabout 3 times more that the Peoples Republic of Davis. Ive lived here for 20 years and I never have to use a flashlight to walk my dog at night.  However, in the east my bay city of Lafayette, it was so dark in the area I lived in night time walks required a blind mans cane or a flashlight.  Anyone else want to see the milky way when they step outside and look up at the sky?  Our light polluted skies depress me.  I dont have to breathe second hand smoke, we pass laws to limit air pollution, Davis has ordinances that limit noise levels but what about my neighbors porch lights that shine in my yard, polluting darkness with their second hand light?  PEOPLE OF DAVIS, BE POLITICALLY CORRECT AND KEEP YOUR LIGHTS SHINING DOWN IN YOUR OWN YARDS (AND NOT MINE!).  CITY OF DAVIS, SAVE ENERGY AND MONEY!  TURN OFF EVERY OTHER STREET LIGHT.  USE THE MONEY YOU SAVE TO LIGHT THE GROUND AND NOT THE SKY!Casandra and the Dark Sky Society.
