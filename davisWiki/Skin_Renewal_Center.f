The Skin Renewal Center is a professional, yet intimate, Clinical Day spa, which strives to pamper its customers. They offer microdermabrasion, chemical peels, facials, waxing and massage therapy.  They also provide medical aesthetic laser treatments such as IPL, Laser Hair Removal, Skin Resurfacing, Skin Tightening, Fraxel 1540 and 1440, Botox and other dermal fillers. They offer a free consultation with their estheticians and or aesthetic nurses to help you decide which treatment is best  for you, and continuing education of the Staff has kept them up to date with the latest skin care techniques, products and knowledge. The staff also receives direct handson training from several skin care product manufacturers. They claim to use only the latest techniques and state of the art products.

One of the common techniques used at the Skin Renewal Center is called microdermabrasion, and is one of the most powerful weapons that skin care experts offer for antiaging. In this treatment/facial, your skin is stimulated to produce a new layer of skin cells, bringing with it an increased level of collagen to the skin’s surface.
They recommend you stop by to check out their Young blood Mineral Make Up line.  The foundation combines natural minerals, Vitamin A, C, and E with a natural nonchemical UVA_UVB sun protector of SPF 15.

The fact of the matter is that our products do not just work on the surface of the skin, they penetrate and do have the ability to speed cellular metabolism affected by many variables. Metabolism slows with age, stress, smoking and/or too much alcohol consumption. You will want to use a professional product with the highest active ingredient, best formulation and latest technology.

The Skin Renewal Center offers a peaceful haven for Clinical Facials. They provide an assorted menu of stimulating and clinical spa treatments such as rejuvenating facials, invigorating massages, and various waxing services. Their unique facials are customized to your skin type in order to meet your personal skin care needs. They also recommend that you take time to receive a soothing massage to relieve anxiety and improve your overall health.

20071105 21:36:05 nbsp I highly reccommend this spa! I have been to many day spas and this is the best facial Ive ever had! The esthetician talked with me about my skin and then custom designed a facial for me. Very attentive and super relaxing!  My skin looked amazing after! Hands down, best facial in Davis. Thank you skin renewal center!   Users/HeatherQuinn

20080214 17:39:18 nbsp this spa sounds amazing... Im going to check it out!  Do you know if they do anything for stretch marks?  I only see creams and stuff online like this http://www.divasblog.com I was looking for a spa treatment for stretch marks... any help would be greatly appreciated! Users/kristyK

Reply from SRC staff: Yes, we do offer a variety of services for stretch marks. For more information please call us at 753 1605. We will be more than happy to help you.

20080317 11:44:16 nbsp I had a wonderful experience with the skin renewal center.  I have always had troubles with my skin and as a full time student it hasnt made it a top priority.  Alysha was able to specifically tailor treatments to my skin in my price range.  On my second visit my skin had NEVER looked so good!  I was so confident I was able to go to school with nothing but eye makeup on my face (Which has never happened since I started wearing makeup) I have noticed drastic results with my skin in only 2 visits.  I highly recommend Alysha, shes great! Users/chrystahall

20080902 12:42:45 nbsp My lady friend just went there and she was extremely happy.  Clean facility, knowledgeable staff, good services and a fair price.  She was very impressed with the results and has scheduled her second appointment. Users/loneshark

20090329 18:49:35 nbsp Tess at the Skin Renewal Center has changed my life. I have very temperamental skin and was not happy with the quality of my skin. I will be getting married this summer and I wanted to recondition my skin before the big day and all that close up photography. I started a series of microdermabrasion treatments back in January and my skin has improved dramatically. I didnt think it was possible for my skin to be so clear and healthy looking. I am extremely grateful for the services I have received from the Skin Renewal Center. I also enjoy the hospitality and welcoming atmosphere. You cant put a price on beautiful skin that makes you feel radiant, but the services I have purchased were worth every penny.   ~Dee Users/Dee22

20090627 21:29:35 nbsp Tess rocks! I almost feel asleep while she was doing my eyebrows. It was that relaxing. She did a fantastic job too. Ill never go back to another local spa to get this service done. Tess is now #1 in my book. Users/DebWestergaard

20091005 09:17:36 nbsp The skin renewal center has changed my life!!  I originally went in for laser hair removal on my face, but I was so happy that Ive gone back for other areas too!  Tess has also made a huge impact on the clarity of my face, it feels and looks so much better than when I first came in.  Hannah (the owner) is wonderful and is always accommodating to my crazy schedule.  Im so glad that Ive found the Skin Renewal Center! Users/UMDGrad

20100812 18:45:53 nbsp I went there for a face treatment. Tess is good but very aggressive. I had a lot of wound on my face after the treatment. I am not sure if it was worth it. Users/sarah1982

20100924 11:26:05 nbsp  Hello Sarah,I came across your review here and wanted to thank you first for your honest review. We were never notified of your skin problems after your facial with Tess. We usually try to check back with our clients a week after their treatment to see if they have any questions or comments.
I must have missed you, if so I do apologize for that, I would really appreciate it if you would either call me or email me and let me know exactly what happened with your skin treatment and I am sure we can find a way to fix it . I know it is kind of late, I wish I had seen your comment sooner, but as they say better late than never.
Again, Thank you and I hope to hear from you soon.
Hanna

20121210 12:11:43 nbsp I called last minute for a facial and was lucky enough that Ines had a space available. Ive had facials at this location before but never had such great customer service as I had with Ines. She was gentle with the extractions and recommend the right products for my skin to take home! Shes very sweet and I look forward to my next facial and maybe even a waxing service with her.  Users/fffashion13

20121213 21:00:02 nbsp I have had facials from the spa and feel that Ines is by far the best I have ever had at any spa.  The professionalism, recommendations and overall care to my skin is incredible, and I can not thank Ines enough for providing the service and recommendations that have cleared my skin.  Thank you,Thank you,Thank you,Thank you,Thank you!!!!!!!!  Users/josiewalton

20130206 19:43:00 nbsp This place is on top of my list of my favorites to get a facial. Inez did such a wonderful job on my face, my skin is clean and soft and her neck massage is so relaxing that I didnt want to get up from the bed! I will be back in 4 weeks and they give you 10% off on your next treatment if you book between 4 to 6 weeks! Im very happy! Users/NiceBlue

Users/AmandaLewis

20130707 09:48:52 nbsp I have been searching for a massage therapist for soooo long.  After visiting the Skin Renewal Center and meeting Jack, my search has ended!  He is absolutely amazing, professional and more knowledgeable than any therapist I have EVER been to. Usually when I leave a massage at other places, I feel a little sore or unaffected by the session.  When I leave from a session with Jack, I feel completely renewed.  To any a all looking for a fabulous massage therapist and a wonderful environment, Jack at the Skin Renewal Center is the place to go!! Users/alexismann

20130813 17:00:53 nbsp This is the best spa in Davis! I tried a lot of places in Davis for waxing. I was always unhappy, until I found Tess. I always walk out with perfect eyebrows. I have had facials from all of the ladies there, and they are all great. I also just started laser hair removal. I got a great deal on two areas! If you are looking for clean, professional, and friendly spa, you have to try them. Users/ShayAllen
