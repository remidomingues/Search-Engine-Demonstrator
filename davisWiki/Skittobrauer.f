Micheal Keating will go down in history as the person for having the idea for skittobrauer. Users/TaylorClark Taylor Clark, Mike, Dylan Weiss, and Users/IsaacHamlenGomez Isaac HamlenGomez made it happen. The idea came from when you leave a package of skittles in your pocket, and they get soft and stick together in a bar. Then Mike decided you could sell it if you pronouced the name weird. Hence, skittle bar became skittobrauer (skittobrowER). The original production failed, as the makers tried to heat up the bar faster in the microwave. The result was a brown, rock hard, lump of crap. It tasted like ash. This soon came to be known as shittobrauer. So anyway, the production was perfected, and then the product was rolled into a ball and covered in powdered sugar and/or sprinkles.
