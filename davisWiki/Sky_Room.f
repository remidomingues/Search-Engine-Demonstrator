The Sky Room is a meeting room on the Fifth Floor of the Memorial Union.   It is rarely seen by students, as access to the fifth floor has been highly restricted. Departments like Campus Unions, the MU Information Center Info Center, SPAC, and many of the head honchos of the MU (Brett Burns, Tom Compton, etc.) use this room for high level meetings. A small room connected to the Sky Room houses much archived paperwork for multiple departments (including an audit of the UCD Equestrian Center Equestrian Center oddly enough), as well as the controls for the bell tower.

The original reason that the fifth floor was offlimits was because the KDVS antenna could expose people to potentially unsafe levels of RF energy.  Since the antenna has since moved to Kerr Hall (and is planned to be moved off campus); this is no longer an issue.  The current reason that the top floor is off limits is because of the large amount of equipment that is stored there by Campus Unions Operations and Campus Unions Event Services, like tables, chairs, floor cleaners, flat beds, the umbrellas that can be found the second floor patio and the Freeborn Plaza around the Seal of the University university seal, etc.  There are also some stories about wild parties which took place on the fifth floor patio and in the Sky Room.

Currently, you can only see the room through a small window on the east stairwell of the MU.

The Friends Urging Campus Kindness slate proposed restoring access to the fifth floor, as they feel that a student union should actually be accessible by students.  However, this goal has been overshadowed by their many other Friends Urging Campus Kindness Platform goals.

20060123 21:48:47 nbsp As an undergrad in the 90s, I used to eat lunch all the time up here on the roof when tables were full up in the Coho.  And that was when the antennae was up here cranking out 5000 watts. To close the roof after spending so much to make it even more safe and attractive is messed up. Users/MattJurach

20060303 13:40:29 nbsp Actually, the fifth floor is closed off since its used for storage and theres a lot of machinery up there to keep the elevators running.   Users/StarrOleary

20060311 15:06:23 nbsp Holy crap someone made it in?! Users/KrisFricke

20061018 01:09:37 nbsp Is the Sky Room the ASUCD Gulag? Seems like a sensible location for its theoretical location. Either there, or in the basements of Freeborn. Users/JosephBleckman

20070130 15:08:41 nbsp No picure of the roof itself? Users/MartySmith

20071025 23:27:44 nbsp Anyone have any new information regarding access to the sky deck?  Just putting this up so people have a look if theyre looking at recent changes.  Does anyone have any info or influence on this topic?  Id love to hang out on the roof? Users/MartySmith

20071026 01:24:29 nbsp Newest thing I have is that its planned to be open in the MU Master Plan as one of the later phases... though there isnt really money for the first phase right now, expanding the Bookstore. Users/BrentLaabs

20080811 16:08:08 nbsp Me and my girlfriend try to get up there all the time, and she managed to get up there one day finally last quarter. She said she hit the 5th floor button on the west elevator and this time the door actually opened up there, but she was too scared to stay up there for too long lol Users/Juan.Salvador

20101001 11:04:39 nbsp The 5th floor doesnt just contains rooms, there is a large open area and what looks like what used to be a coffee shop. Even if they dont want to provide services up here (understandable), they could allow access for study tables or something. It is really awesome up there, I wish they would open it up to everyone. I think the main limitation is the elevators  they are already in use almost all of the time for floors 14  it would be impossible to keep them operating for all 5 floors. If they only had study/eating tables up there, and no food services, then I think it would be manageable. They would have to add an elevator in order to provide any kind of services up there. They would also have to clean up the massive amounts of crap that is being stored up there. We paid for this building, it saddens me (although not surprising in the least) they can just say no, we are not using a whole floor. PS: Stop taking the elevator from Floor 2 to Floor 1 people. I havent worked there in like 4 years and it still bugs me. Users/GarrettGallegos

20101029 00:53:14 nbsp The Sky room is no longer a meeting room, CU stores tools and equipment in it now. I was just up there tonight. Users/trkerbavaz

20101029 02:04:34 nbsp added new photos from tonight. very interesting place! Love the view from up there. Users/mperkel

20101029 09:52:23 nbsp I came up here for work once and aside from all the crap that is scattered around the patio it reminded me of an awesome spot for a small dance or other gathering. There was even what looked like a minibar on the east end. As of Summer 09 theres just a couple maintenance duded up there. Theyve got the best office view of the campus no doubt! If I ran ASUCD i would really look into cleaning it up and hosting small events up there again. Its perfect for it. Users/ARWENNHOLD
