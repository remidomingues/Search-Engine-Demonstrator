Always wanted to go skydiving?  Heres your chance! Skydance offers two ways to get started:

Tandem Assisted Freefall  An hour of instruction followed by a flight to between 9,000 and 14,000 feet where you and the instructor you are strapped to jump out and freefall for 3060 seconds before deploying the parachute.  Skydance also offers a tandem jump from 18,000 feet  thats 90 seconds of freefall!

Accelerated Freefall Program  A comprehensive training program starting with a full day of instruction. This is the training program that will set you on the road to making jumps by yourself and with others.


Every year they stage a jump demonstration before the July 4th Fireworks in Community Park. As they are jumping commentary is provided over the public address system. Should you have an opportunity to visit Skydance, be sure to check out their photo album, which includes some disturbing nude skydiving photos.  Spectators are always welcome; weekends are the best time to come out and watch.

In 2007, an episode of Mythbusters featured Skydance.

At least eight people have been killed in at least six accidents associated with SkyDance since it opened in 1987, out of an unknown total number of jumps; the last fatality was in 2013.  These fatal accidents are documented on the Tragic Events page.  Three of the fatalities were Skydance customers diving in tandem jumps with their instructors.  The fatality rate skydiving in the United States is about 1 per 60,000 jumps according to http://www.skydivingmagazine.com/faq.htm Skydiving Magazine; this is comparable to the fatality rate for driving 1,000 miles according to the http://hazmat.dot.gov/riskmgmt/riskcompare.htm Department of Transportation.





It is my understanding that Skydance runs one of the largest and best drop zones in the world.  Users/JasonAller

20060202 22:48:54 nbsp Just googled skydance skydiving death  at least three people have jumped out of a plane to their death at this place. Users/PaulThober

20060203 04:07:35 nbsp Well, thats always comforting. Users/JohnNapier

20060203 04:14:46 nbsp From what Ive been able to tell from a little internet research, both the top two comments are true. Which only goes to show that skydiving does come with some risk. That being said, it seems they also have twice yearly 30,000 foot drops. Thats just insane. Almost makes me want to spend the time and money to get my class D certificate so I could jump on one of those outings... Users/EricKlein

20060213 16:27:05 nbsp Ive jumped at dropzones throughout the US; Skydance is a great place to make your first (and subsequent) skydives.  They are one of only 5 or 6 places in the world flying the PAC750XL, a plane designed for skydiving.  Spectators are always welcome, but pets arent. Users/LisaBriggs

20060518 12:43:43 nbsp I did a tandem jump there last year. Their staff did a great job, I felt very safe and had a lot of fun. Users/GoKerby

20070731 17:36:37 nbsp I saw a tandem and some singles come down during the Plainfield volunteer firefighter pancake breakfast Users/StevenDaubert

20090419 22:52:54 nbsp I went for my first tandem jump here at 13000 feet, I felt very safe and the staff was very fun, yet professional. They are wonderful and I definitely recommend them! Users/SamanthaP

  http://www.skydanceskydiving.net/tandem.php It was a few links in, in an odd location. You can click the link a the top of that page for AFF, which I assume means the program where youre not strapped to another person. users/JoePomidor

20100601 10:32:23 nbsp Here are the prices  http://www.skydance.net/skydance_skydiving_pricing_TANDEM.htm

This is a wonderful place, I am not old enough to skydive yet, but I think I will do a tandem on my 18th birthday and I already have a jump ticket! I have known Ray for a really long time and all of the people out there are super friendly.  Users/Jumpergem

20140313 10:49:44 nbsp I am very impressed by Skydance. Very professional and worth the first time tandem 13,000 foot jump (60 sec. freefall). My instructor (Greg) is exceptionally experienced and made the jump quite fun and safe. I would recommend jumping at Skydance ONLY if you really have wanted to skydive. Skydiving is not for everyone but very special for those who really have the desire. When possible, Oahu is next on my list. Users/GarySaylin
