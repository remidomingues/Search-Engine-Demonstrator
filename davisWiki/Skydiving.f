Skydiving is a sport that might be the most outdoors of all outdoor activities.  Locally, the Yolo County Airport is home to Skydance Skydiving (who have been featured on the national television show Mythbusters).

While almost everybody skydives safely, there have also been some Tragic events/Airplane/Skydiving Accidents tragic accidents for some skydivers.
