Slacklining is a sports sport created by rock climbing climbers and boulderers to build muscle control and balance. It is similar to tight rope walking, but instead of rope, 1 webbing is used. The webbing is flat so a slackliners foot doesnt roll off it. The rope is somewhat dynamic so it stretches when one stands on it. It is generally set a few feet off the ground, between trees less than 30 feet apart, but some are longer. Slacklines higher than 20 feet above the ground are called highlines. Some have been set up thousands of feet in the air.

Some students set them up in the Quad or on fields around campus. If you have a question or want to try it out, just ask! Climbers, boulderers, and slackliners are friendly by nature! Its pretty easy to learn, but hard to get good at it. Keep practicing!

The most common spot on campus is in front of Outdoor Adventures  Users/StevenDaubert

Going to UCD next year, own a slackline (and other necessary gear) but never got good at it due to a lack of places to set up, eventually forgot how to do so. If I bring my gear, where can I relearn how to set up my line?  Users/AdriannaA
  Visit Outdoor Adventures anytime during business hours. Theres almost always a slackline set up out front during good weather. The folks there would be more than happy to give you all the help youd want.  Users/ARWENNHOLD


Davis Slackline Ordinance
In 2014, the City of Davis piloted new slackline regulations that limited slacklining in city parks to only three locations in Davis, (on in Oak Grove Park; one near Del Oro and Faro; and one near Anza, Catalina and Bella Casa).  Slacklining is not allowed in any other public park within the City of Davis.   Further regulations under this program require tree protection (basically soft material placed between the tree and the line), limit the height of the line to no more than 4 off the ground, and limit slacklining to daytime hours only.  http://publicworks.cityofdavis.org/slackliningincityofdavisparks More information can be found here.
