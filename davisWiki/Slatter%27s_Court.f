Slatters Court is an affordable Rental Housing Guide housing option and one of the few mobile home parks in Davis. Slatters Court was originally owned and operated by the Slatter family. It was a roadside gas station on the Lincoln Highway which developed into a campsite, and then a tourist court. The Olive Drive gas stations gas station  became a barber shops barber shop. While Slatters Court is technically in South Davis due to being just barely South of Amtrak, its basically a quick 12 block walk to downtown unless they put up the Olive Drive Railroad Fence. Slatters Court also walking distance to the east border of the UC Davis Campus.Slatters Court has historically been a home for both financially challenged and quirky UC Davis students and residents.

According to some residents, its a fun place to live and the rent is reasonable. The people are cool cuz they all have an affinity for disobedience.

The laundry room at Slatters Court has hosted art shows in the past. In July and August of 2005 the Nelson Gallery hosted a show about Slatters Court by Terry Berlier. http://www.newsreview.com/issues/sacto/20050811/news2.asp Here is an article in the Sacramento News and Review about Terry Berliers film and art project for Slatters Court.

In July 2003, 47 year old David Lawrence Beale was arrested after decomposing and mummified human body parts were found near a dumpster at Slatters Court, where hed lived previously. Subsequent investigations uncovered an additional 157 pounds of body parts in an Olive Drive storage locker and in a shed behind his home on Erma Lane in the Royal Oaks Royal Oak Trailer Park mobile home park. Beale, a selftaught autopsy tech, admitted to collecting the parts for study over a fifteen year period.

20071014 22:06:32 nbsp Ive known many people who lived at Slatters Court in the past twentyfive years, and there are a number of positive aspects to the area and the community. Ive known people who rented the Big House (#71), who lived in cabins, and who lived in trailers. Please be aware that some people are driven RAVING CRAZY by the process of dealing with the office and landlord. A prospective renter really should find a way to hear some stories & see whether they could be happy with that kind of attitude towards maintenance and repairs. Because the cabins are old now, and they werent exactly build to last... Still, some people are able to adjust their expectations, appreciate the Olive Drive vibe, and feel that its a fun place to live and the rent is reasonable. Users/DougWalter

20080625 17:16:19 nbsp I dont think it works like other parks where you bring you own trailer or mobile home. It seems like they own the trailers as well and people just rent from them. Although you might ask them. Users/Innisfree

20090122 22:57:06 nbsp In about 71, when I was 12, I became friends with Francis Wilkins whose family ran Slatters Court at the time. They lived in #71 which even then was called The Big House. There were six kids; Stephen, Mary, Francis, Joe, Maritn, and Martha. I think you can still see the repair that had to be done to the garage next to the house when Mrs Wilkins tried to pull the Travelall into the garage with the boat still on top. There was a store at the entrance directly across the from the Barber Shop that we called The Little Store and it was run by Mr and Mrs Chase who lived with their son, Jay, in one of the two trailers that were on the east side of #71. Francis was a hard working kid who would do work around the place outside of regular kid chores for $1.65 an hour which was the minimum wage at the time. I thought it was unusual that Francis would spend his own money for a haircut from Frank The Barber until I saw the haircuts his mom gave. She did a modified bowl cut that looked like she cocked the bowl over to the side before cutting around the rim. Now, in the mid 80s that would have been a hip and stylish asymmetrical bob but at the time it just looked strange. My theory was that she figured by having the hair longer on one side it would always look like it was combed to the side. Maybe I give her too much credit. The smallest bungalow in the place was right next to the back gate to the SP tracks#47 or maybe 49where Mr Ord lived. It was maybe 8 by 10 feet. I dont think it even had a toilet. There were some buildings with showers and toilets and sinks spaced around Slatters Court for the bungalows and people with little travel trailers back in the campsite days that didnt have showers. Mr Ord mowed lawns. His arms hung oddly in front of him permanently in lawnmowergripping position. Each day his brother would pick him up from in front the big cork oak by Guiseppies Restaurant. There was a worn circle at the base of the tree with a little path coming off of it that went out to the edge of the pavement. Mr Ord wore that spot out waiting for his brother under the tree occasionally walking out to the street to look down Olive Drive for his brothers truck. He seldom spoke (maybe he never spoke) and sort of gave me the creeps which I felt guilty about because it seemed sort of sad living in that tiny place. Once the Wilkinses went on a trip so I took Franciss place cleaning the shower rooms and the bathroom in the building that was called the hall which had a long hallway with mens rooms off of it and at one end a communal (shared, anyway)kitchen and one or two bathrooms with showers. When Francis was showing me the ropes he showed me where Ray The Bum kept his razor; sort of behind a the hot water heater in one of the shower rooms. Ray The Bum lived it a pile of stuff with corrugated metal on top of it next to the tracks behind the group of houses situated on the other side of Slatters Courts eastern fence. I call it a pile of stuff because it was too short, in my opinion, to be a shack. It was maybe three and a half, four feet high in there. Francis showed me the inside once. There was a console TVno electricity but there was a TV. In the winter when it was real cold or rainy they let Ray The Bum sleep in the lobby (if you want to call it that) of the Hotel Aggie.

20090822 09:17:42 nbsp Im curious. Im thinking of moving here. What is someone trying to say about this place. For example, it says above wehre the place has an affinity for disobedience, and then the news clipping about human body parts. Is this a joke, or is the place a dangerous place to live? Fill me in. I dont want to make a mistake moving here. Im in poverty and need affordabe, peaceful housing. Is this a good place for this.  Users/paige42

Slatters is probably the cheapest and closest to downtown Davis you will find. I can say from experience that it is a safe and friendly place. I would recommend it. Users/jchammons

20091027 12:37:44 nbsp I have lived here for five years.  My assesment is that the Davis Trailer Park is a very quiet qnd safe place to live.  There is nice mix of peiple that are friendly and watchful of their neighbors. For residents who like privacy, Ellen George the property mamager,  stays clear of your ordinary doings but will intervene only when something is amiss.  The property is well maintained and improved on as requierd for a high quality of living.  Users/jrhudson

20100217 03:12:31 nbsp Ive been living here for a few years. Its been run down, but the owners have been putting some money back into it recently. They had to replace the roofs, and I suppose they decided if theyd already made the investment, they might as well get the place a little better to live in. Maintainence requests are now being handled promptly and with alarming efficiency. Make no mistake, its OLD, and is showing it, but its livable. A good place for someone determined to live without housemates.

The Beale case was a bit shocking, having happened about 100 feet from my front door. Nothing like coming home and finding a notice from the police: Hmmm.. what have we here.. police.. suspicious activity.. call if.. wait.. Human Body Parts?!. I slept with a machete under my pillow until they caught him.

Upsides: Cheap rent, close to downtown, good sense of community and tolerant of oddballs.
Downsides: Train tracks located immediately adjacent to the park (one section is even named Sleepless Hollow), very small cabins, and the aforementioned oddball neighbors. Users/Flynn
  Hahaha I hope youre a very still sleeper... didnt lose any ears or fingers or anything with that machete under the pillow? Users/TomGarberson
