20080115 23:12:16 nbsp My favorite restaurant.  Period.  Ive been to Chez Panisse, Stars, Cirque, and no other place comes close to atmosphere of Slocum House.  Loads of charmthe courtyard on a summer evening is great.  The chickens that freely roam that part of Fair Oaks also roam the property extensively, and provide a lot of entertainment for the diners.  The food is excellent, too.  Highly, highly, highly recommended.
