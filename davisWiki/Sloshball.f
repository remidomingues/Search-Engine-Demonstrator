wiki:wikipedia:Sloshball is a drinking games drinking game.  It is played very much like your typical wiki:wikipedia:Softball softball or wiki:wikipedia:Kickball kickball rules but with a few twists:

  Instead of a second base, there is a kegs keg of beer. Its usually something collegey and cheap. Like Natural Ice
  To determine whos home and/or away the two captains chug a beer. Winner gets to choose.
  When people reach second base after batting the only way to move on to third is to finish a beer. At this point there are two variations to the game.
        Chug Rules: Each runner must chug a beer while at the keg before the next runner reaches second or else it is considered an out.
        Normal Rules: When a runner reaches second they may stay there until they finish their beer and more than one runner is allowed on second base.


 Annual Sloshball Games 


  Every year there is the infamous sloshball game between The California Aggie and ASUCD. In 2005 the Aggie just decided to not play ASUCD.  What were their reasons?  Well, its probably because ASUCD always wins.  So the Aggie decided to take on the pale, skinny kids at KDVS for 2005, and even issued a joke press release about their decision. As it turned out, staffers from the Aggie did beat KDVS, after a 7th or so inning BBQ break and keg substitution; but its not like it was a surprise (even though there were a few runs that the Aggie scored due to balls that were arguably hit in foul territory and counted as fair). KDVS should be proud of their athletic effort  after all, they actually had jerseys.  In 2004, the game was canceled due to the ASUCD Senator Ackerman Scandal and other tensions between the organizations. Two years ago, however, The California Aggie The Aggie got trounced by ASUCD.
        The trees that haunted KDVS from the previous years game would not be a factor in their 2006 rematch with The California Aggie for Lower Freeborn bragging rights. Fielding a squad which featured improved athleticism and their trademark enthusiasm, KDVS went on to defeat the Aggie 2211 in twelve innings of play.
  SOS has their annual Picnic Day sloshball game (mandatory chug rules) after most of the normal festivities are over. This game usually gets pretty rowdy (last year it ended up in wrestling and keg stands).  Often, old school SOS staff and officers show up for the annual event.

  The CoHo regularly holds sloshball events (45 a year) and will either play amongst each other...kitchen versus out front or play other large agencies on campus like Unitrans and KDVS. So far the CoHo has a perfect record when playing other teams. Unitrans was soundly defeated by the CoHo in early 2006, they even left before the kegs were finished so the CoHo ended up playing each other. In late summer 2006 the CoHo narrowly defeated KDVS....the narrow victory be blamed on KDVSs refusal to drink a lot...and thus staying sober longer than the CoHo.

 Add more...I know there are more.



During spring, there are Sloshball games about three times a week at Manor Park or Slide Hill Park Slide Hill Park. This is probably because Open Container Ordinance open containers are allowed and there is an awesome cement slide.


20050604 02:57:04 nbsp This is just a quick little note to let KDVS that they are about to get PWNZER3D by The California Aggie tomorrow. Good luck, folks. That Sudwerk trip was all the energy needed. W00t! Users/MichaelGiardina

20050606 06:31:22 nbsp I think Im smelling a Columnists vs Feminists game, well bring the pink you bring the pain.  Users/JimSchwab

20050606 16:58:00 nbsp I think Users/JimSchwab James is saying this in jest. I think the Aggie is a great college newspaper and the best paper in Yolo County. And I, for one, concede that the Aggie won the sloshball game even though I do debate a couple runs they scored.  I will also say that the Aggie is a better news source than KDVS. That is because it is not KDVS speciality. BUT if you divde the product that KDVS provides by how much emplyees are paid and look at the product and do the same thing with the Aggie, lets be honest, dollar for dollar KDVS is better.

20050606 21:24:31 nbsp LOL, Sorry I guess sarcasm does not translate well over the internet. I was just trying to bring some humor. Users/JimSchwab

20060219 16:38:23 nbsp Uh, can anybody say Slip N Sloshball?  The name should be pretty self explanatory, but you get a slip n slide for the last leg of the third to home stretch.  Set up the SNS so it is at an angle.  You dont want to bat in a puddle.  Ive only found one park in all of Davis that can accomodate it.  Suffice it to say you need a spigot near home plate, and about 100 feet of garden hose.  Its in an elementary schools field.  Any more and I give away our secluded spot.  Happy searching!
