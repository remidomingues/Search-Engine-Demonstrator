   Davis Goes SLOW because...

...its worth it and we live in a place where we can do it!


One of the best places to go slow is in a motorized vehicle. Motorists who drive slowly not only save themsevles and the lives of others by being a safer driver, but they save fuel and make the bicycling environment infinitely better!
