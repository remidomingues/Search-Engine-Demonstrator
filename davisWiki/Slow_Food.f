The slow food movement idea was founded in 1986, and while not being Davis exclusive; the whole scope of the movement is the preservation of the pleasure one may derive from a meal enjoyed slowly.  Attempting to steer away from the whole feeling of a hustled meal, tossed into the car, and away we go.  The whole notion deals with the idea of premade products.

From Slow Food USA:

Slow Food U.S.A. believes that pleasure and quality in everyday life can be achieved by slowing down, respecting the convivial traditions of the table and celebrating the diversity of the earths bounty. Our goal is to put the carriers of this heritage on center stage and educate our membership on the importance of these principles.

(Another wiki Food Debate and Analysis/Fast vs. Slow page also exists related to this topic and someone might want to reconcile info.)

 This page reminds me of how Edward Abbey and others of the IntermountainWest described cows as slow elk. Users/NickSchmalenberger
