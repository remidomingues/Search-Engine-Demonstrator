Welcome to the Wiki... you might seriously want to consider the importance of using your RealName here on the wiki, so we can get to know you (yes, my wife calls me JabberWokky, but my business card reads Evan Edwards).  The What I Wish I knew document you uploaded is fantastic!  Did you write it yourself?  Id like to import it into the page itself, but I wanted to make sure you understood that contributions to the Wiki have to be from the author (or you otherwise have the Copyrights necessary to release it).  Its a great document, and thanks for the contribution.  Please let me know.  And seriously consider using your name... otherwise itll be odd meeting you at a Wiki gatherings Wiki gathering and asking Shall I call you Mr. Man or just Slut?. Users/JabberWokky
