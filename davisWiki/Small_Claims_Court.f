Small Claims Court is an excellent way for the average person to seek justice in disputes involving relatively small amounts of money ($7,500 or less in California).  In small claims court, neither party can bring an attorneys attorney!  Each party may receive help and advice from an attorney during preparations, but in court, no attorneys (unless the plaintiff or defendant are themselves attorneys) are allowed.

From the wiki:WikiPedia:Small_claims_court Wikipedia entry: Small claims courts are courts of limited jurisdiction that hear civil cases between private litigants.  The business of small claims courts typically encompasses small private disputes in which large amounts of money are not at stake. The routine collection of small debts forms a large portion of the cases brought to small claims courts, as well as evictions and other disputes between landlord and tenant unless the jurisdiction is already covered by a tenancy board.

20110308 17:57:43 nbsp Important question, and maybe there are some lawyers here who can help me out. We have a roommate who moved out for a job elsewhere in the state. She is on the lease with us until August 31. She has not been able to find a replacement for the room (and we have been looking, too). She is now threatening to stop paying rent  this will add up to $2350 by the end of the lease and clearly we cannot cover that. Is small claims the best way to recover rent money from her?

As a side note, she is also refusing to contribute anything to utilities bills. Our WSG and internet bills stay the same whether there are two people here or three people here (and PG&E didnt change much either)  doesnt seem fair to me, since I signed a lease with the understanding that I would be splitting bills with two people, not one.

Thoughts? Users/MeggoWaffle

            We emailed our landlord for advice and have not yet heard back. We dont have the Davis Model Lease, but it looked like her dad signed it as a guarantor, so well see if hell be more responsible than she is. The agreement was that SHE would be responsible for finding a replacement since she is the one who moved out, but we have been posting ads and meeting people too. Lots of emails to prove that. Well see what happens... Users/MeggoWaffle
