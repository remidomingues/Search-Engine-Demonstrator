The small house movement is the Architects architectural and social movement that advocates living in small homes, usually ecofriendly, green, and sometimes completely off the grid. It is particularly vocal in the USA, where the book The Not So Big House is credited with starting the backlash against supersized homes. One of the early craftsmen of the tiny house, with regard to their current growing popularity, is Jay Shafer, who in 2002 cofounded The Small House Society in Iowa City, Iowa. Shafer went on to start the http://www.tumbleweedhouses.com Tumbleweed Tiny Houses in Sebastopol, CA.

The Tiny House/Small House Movement seems to be starting to take hold here, which is to be expected because the movement and the doityourself nature of these homes would seem to be a great fit with the ideals of many Davis residents. Some people have already approached the City inquiring about starting a cooperative of these types of tiny homes.

These homes are reminiscent of the Human Powered Housing Project that used to wheel around and park around town. And of course, the most quintessential tiny houses of all, a very symbol of Davis and all it stands for, are the The Domes Baggins End Domes on the UC Davis Campus.

If you are thinking of building, or have already built, one of these homes, please add to this page. We are just forming a local interest group, and we would like to build one of these homes to get our feet wet, so if you want to do it with a group or just help build one to sell, please post here and join us. We have a facebook group started, the DavisSac Area Tiny House Enthusiasts so please check it out! First thing we need is people interested, and second thing is someplace to build! Preferably someplace protected from rain. We hope those with construction experience might be interested in joining!

With regard to the tiny homes on trailers, one of the issues that hopefully will change as this movement becomes larger, is where to park them and live in them.

Ive always dreamed of doing a small house style commune in the Grande Avenue School Site.  I have plans roughly sketched out... Daubert

20120126 11:57:15 nbsp I would love to see a Tiny House Cooperative Village, a la the Domes, but for nonstudents. Just need land. Guess it would have to be designated a trailer park to fall under city codes. Or, it could be just outside city limits. All thats needed is land.....SH Users/StephHolm

20120126 15:26:15 nbsp The first meeting of the http://www.facebook.com/groups/235075219907692/ DSATHE (DavisSacramento Area Tiny House Enthusiasts) took place today at 1 pm at Cafe Bernardo in downtown Sac. There were just two of us, but we were VERY enthusiastic  hence the name. Please let me know if you are interested! In 10 years I hope to be building my Tiny House. The other party hopes to have hers within the next few years. We have a lot of big ideas about cooperative living, and want to hook up with like minded people, or people who are interested in designing and constructing these homes. Users/StephHolm
    If you guys continue having meetings, Id be interested in attending someday if we can do it in Davis (I dont have a car)!  Users/ScottMeehleib

20120126 16:16:09 nbsp I expect we will meet all over, and if its outside of Davis and not during my work hours, I would be happy to drive! Users/StephHolm

20120126 21:08:37 nbsp I just created a Facebook group called http://www.facebook.com/groups/235075219907692/ DavisSac Area Tiny House Enthusiasts so please come and join us. Prob the easiest way to get the word around and let people know about meetings etc. I bet there are some folks out there that are getting ready to get their house started. I would love to help in the process and see it start to finish! Users/StephHolm

20120127 08:17:58 nbsp I just joined the DavisSac Area Tiny House Enthusiasts and it is very exciting. The Davis area would be great for a tiny house community and frankly might be the perfect place to establish a model village for others to learn from. Tiny and green is the way!

20120127 09:50:56 nbsp This video is a couple of years old, but the challenge of where to park a fully functional small home still remains.

20120127 13:27:51 nbsp I think it would be super fab to build one of these as a group (if we had somewhere to build it) and then sell it and split the profits (if any....or just consider it experience) to just see how its done.  Users/StephHolm

20120130 11:39:54 nbsp I made a comment to Pepper of http://www.bungalowtogo.com/ Bungalow to Go about bringing her exquisitely crafted http://www.bungalowtogo.com/content/towheelisting Towhee Tiny House for sale to Davis to show (she is located in Sonoma County), and she is familiar with and loves the Domes and thought showing it in Davis would be a good idea. Hopefully she will come! I would LOVE to see this home in person! Users/StephHolm

20120201 22:00:05 nbsp Our Facebook group, http://www.facebook.com/groups/235075219907692/ DavisSac Area Tiny House Enthusiasts, is now 5 strong, and our newest member is the creator of the http://www.tinyhousedesign.com Tiny House Design blog! Turns out he lives just east of Sac! He has much design experience and has built a tiny house, so we are in good company. Users/StephHolm
