As an alternative to getting your smog done in Davis, take a quick drive to Sacramento.  Not only does Smog Express have fast friendly service, but the drive across the Yolo Causeway causeway allows plenty of time for your catalytic converter to reach its  optimal temerature.  You can usually be in and out in 20 minutes. They also offer a free retest.
