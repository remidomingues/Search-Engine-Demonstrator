 Smoking in Davis 



Many people in Davis smoke various substances (i.e. Marijuana weed). While most Davis folks disapprove of smoking tobacco, smokers struggle to protect their right to openly consume this legal substance. The Davis City Code prohibits smoking in a wide variety of locations open to the public, and both California state law and Davis City Code prohibit smoking in bars. According to the 2010 State of Tobacco Control report card put out by the American Lung Association, Davis received a B grade for Overall Tobacco Control. Although Davis received an A grade in both Smokefree Outdoor Air and Reducing Sales of Tobacco Products, the overall grade was hampered by a D received in the Smokefree Housing category.



Relevant local law as stated in Davis Municipal Code/34.02.010:

 (x)Smoking shall be prohibited in the following outdoor areas, and smoking, except while passing on the way to another destination, shall be prohibited within twenty feet of or close enough to the following areas for smoke to travel into an area or building, where smoking is prohibited, whichever is greater;
  (1)Public events including but not limited to sports events, entertainment, speaking performances, ceremonies, pageants and fairs,
  (2)Seating provided by eating establishments and bars,
  (3)Entrances and exits to enclosed public areas,
  (4)Within the entryway of any enclosed public area,
  (5)Stairways,
  (6)Within courtyards and other areas where air circulation may be impeded by architectural, landscaping or other barriers,
  (7)Areas not open to the sky,
  (8)Any place where people are using or waiting for a service, entry, or a transaction, including but not limited to ATMS, bank teller windows, telephones, ticket lines, bus stops and cab stands,
  (9)Any place where food and/or drink is offered for sale,
  (10) Childrens play areas,
  (11) Public gardens,
  (12) Open windows of any enclosed public area;


If you observe illegal smoking in Davis and would like it to stop, you can:

  Firmly but politely ask the smoker to stop.  Tell him/her that you dont want to be subjected to secondhand smoke.  Warn him/her that s/he is likely breaking the law.  Keep in mind that this person may be ignorant of the law, and is more likely to comply if treated with respect.

  If at a business such as a restaurant, firmly but politely ask the management to observe the law and respect its nonsmoking patrons.  Keep in mind that the employees of the business may have little or no power over the situation, but management & owners do have control over what happens at their establishment.

  If appropriate, call the Davis Police Departments nonemergency line at +1 (530) 7475400 and ask them to send an officer.  If the officer observes illegal smoking, s/he can cite the offender.

  Accept it, if it is out of your personal proximity, like those with bad BO.

Many years ago professors used to smoke while teaching classes. Many State Universities and Community Colleges have banned smoking for years. Historically, Community College students have had drastically higher rates of smoking than students of UC campuses. Studies have shown that smokers have lower IQs than nonsmokers. IQs dropped with the number of cigarettes smoked. Figures now estimate only about 8 percent of UC students smoke regularly.

A Psychology Professor who used to teach at Davis actually said that smoking had benefits for the world. It reduces the surplus population.

At least one member of faculty decided to retire early as a result of the ban.  Still smoking, just no longer working at UC Davis.

 UC Davis Medical Center 

Smoking has been banned at all UC Medical Centers since November 2011.

 State Law 
Various state legislation affects smoking in Davis.  It is illegal to smoke in a bar or restaurant in California. According to http://lungaction.org/reports/statesummary05.tcl?geo_area_id06 the American Lung Association, the following sections of the http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgibin/calawquery?codesectionlab&codebody California Labor Code apply to smoking in places where people gather:  CA LABOR CODE § 6404.5 & 19994.30 et seq. & 48900 et seq. & 104420 & 1596.795 Los Angeles Countys Department of Health Services has a http://www.lapublichealth.org/tob/legislation.htm good summary of California tobacco legislation.

On 26 January 2006, the California Air Resources Board formally identified secondhand smoke (AKA http://www.arb.ca.gov/toxics/ets/ets.htm environmental tobacco smoke) as a toxic substance that contributes to serious illness and death.

Smoking is a significant source of state income, with approximately 50% of the cost of each pack of cigarettes funding various related and unrelated social programs  just 15% of the tax applied to tobacco products is earmarked for tobaccorelated services and programs. To date, just 8% of tobacco taxes have gone toward cancer research. A proposal going before voters in 2006 proposes to increase one of the two state taxes already applied to cigarettes from 87¢ to $3.47.

In August 2006, the California Senate approved a bill to ban smoking in cars carrying young kids. So dont smoke outside, anywhere near other people, or in your car. That leaves only your house unless, of course, you have children or other people living there or the smoke wafts outside the confines of your four walls  burning food or otherwise bad cooking/breath/body odor is exempt. The car smoking ban was introduced by Assemblyman Paul Koretz, DWest Hollywood, and would cover vehicles carrying children required to ride in a child safety seat.

 Hookah Bars 

  While there have been attempts to set up Hookah Bars in Davis (for smoking tobacco, usually flavored), the Davis antismoking ordinances (and state law) have made setting up such businesses impossible.

 Alternatives to Smoking 

  Eating
  Chocolate
  Exercise
  Sex
  Gum
  Nicotine Patches
  Cow Tipping


This (?) is probably why people gain weight when they stop smoking.  That, and the fact that people dont have the benefit of the metabolism boost cigarettes give you.  On the flip side, having a lung removed will shed a pound or two.


Not everyone who quits gains weight, and the average amount of weight gain for those who do is 6 to 8 pounds. Small trade off for lower cancer and heart disease risk, not to mention not smelling like an ashtray.  Users/AnnaJones

Im sure exercise and cow tipping are very likely causes of weight gain. Users/TusharRawat

20080717 00:52:59 nbsp its a shame that smokers face such extreme criticism from other people.  the car youre driving is polluting the air more than one of us having a cigarette on a bench. Users/film

20090714 22:21:27 nbsp Its a necessity to cool off my house at night after these hot summer days.  Problem is, my new neighbors prefer to smoke outside and while Id prefer to breathe in cool night air, quite often Im breathing in their second hand smoke in my bedroom and living room.  I have no problem with them smoking, I just have a problem with being forced to breathe their second hand smoke inside my house.  Is there anything I can do about it? Users/ClaireB
  Talk to them?
  I had a similar problem, except that my wife was pregnant at the time that the smoke started billowing in through our bedroom window at night.  I talked to the neighbor multiple times and was repeatedly responded to as though I had no right to intrude on what the neighbor was doing on her own property.  Some people have absolutely no consideration for others, and Im always impressed when I see a smoker who is aware of how their actions impact others and tries to circumvent it (too bad that such a mundane thing is impressive).

20090717 10:16:21 nbsp Only an idiot could compare smoking to body odor.  People must breath and we dont want nor should we be forced to endure someone elses drug choices.  It is selfish and rude  talk to em?  That just causes a fight and isnt our job.  Ask the police?  Be real  the Davis PD like all PD are donothing, overpaid, bullies.  For all their groovy, ecobull the Davisites and others who smoke are just selfish pigs  littering the public spaces with their butts, abusing others (do you want your kids to smoke? do you have to endure it?) and were powerless.  So, we really need a nonsmoker liberation front  they dont respect the law and dont respect others  why should we put up with it? Users/MingWa
  Theres already something like an antismoker culture, at least here in California. Have you ever seen those Truth commercials? Theyre basically propaganda. Ive also gotten pretty tired of hearing people who have some new program or bill that they want put into law saying that Well just tax the smokers! Im not a smoker, nor will I ever be, but there are plenty of people out there who get a small amount of pleasure out of it, and are considerate, and go to fairly great lengths to avoid bothering others. Yes, some are inconsiderate, but that person will be inconsiderate no matter what. Also, I can sort of see why any talk you might have with someone would quickly develop into a fight. Try being reasonable and having a discussion, rather than simply launching into the personal accusations and unverifiable claims. Users/JoePomidor

HONG KONG (Reuters) – Chemical extracts from cigarette butts  so toxic they kill fish  can be used to protect steel pipes from rusting, a study in China has found.

In a paper published in the American Chemical Societys biweekly journal Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research, the scientists in China said they identified nine chemicals after immersing cigarette butts in water.

They applied the extracts to N80, a type of steel used in oil pipes, and found that they protected the steel from rusting.

The metal surface can be protected and the iron atoms further dissolution can be prevented, they wrote.

The chemicals, including nicotine, appear to be responsible for this anticorrosion effect, they added.

The research was led by Jun Zhao at Xian Jiaotong Universitys School of Energy and Power Engineering and funded by Chinas state oil firm China National Petroleum Corporation.

Corrosion of steel pipes used by the oil industry costs oil producers millions of dollars annually to repair or replace.

According to the paper, 4.5 trillion cigarette butts find their way into the environment each year. Apart from being an eyesore, they contain toxins that can kill fish.

Recycling could solve those problems, but finding practical uses for cigarette butts has been difficult, the researchers wrote.

China, which has 300 million smokers, is the worlds largest smoking nation and it consumes a third of the worlds cigarettes. Nearly 60 percent of men in China smoke, puffing an average of 15 cigarettes per day.

20100513 12:23:38 nbsp I have included on this site an article released today on how cigarette butts can prove to be useful in stopping oil leaks such as the fierce one we are battling now. In addition, I have read that 50% of the tax money from cigarettes goes to pay for much needed social services for people. As a 20 year smoker, I agree that smoke is harmful and I do all I can to respect other peoples right to stay smoke free and not be exposed to harmful toxins. I go out of my way to follow the Davis rules by staying away from buildings, public places, and open doors, you will likely find me in a corner alone. I also put my cigarette out and keep my butt to throw away as soon as I find a trash can to discard. I am always extremely careful to make sure the butt is not still burning to prevent fire hazards as well. I am tired of being treated like a second class citizen because I smoke. I grew up in a family of smokers, no excuse, and I have been ADDICTED for a long time. I have tried to quit on many occasions, but with layoffs looming, stress at home and work, moving soon, and more, when I try to quit, it truly feels like it would do me in, I would go nuts as I have a mental condition to manage. I am a very charitable person, humanity is my love and I seek ways to and do serve constantly. Yet, people who dont even know me will see me in my corner smoking and give me dirty looks, cough like it is affecting them so far away, and some have even gone as far as to say something mean to me. I feel this is discrimination and unnecessary. I am a person. I have to cope when I am walking to and from work and school with people driving vehicles that are in need of smog and pollution from all of these transportation needs. Believe me, those toxins make me have to hold my breath it is so nasty and harmful. In addition, I have to observe what is in everything I eat and drink and consume because this world has given us toxins at every level. I have had headaches at work when someone sprays their cologne or perfume all around the office. In short, we dont all always like what we see and we are all different, different vices to overcome, choices that others may not approve of, etc. How many of us really want anyone to get in our face about it? How many of us dont already understand and are doing the best we can with what we have? I will be respectful of your wishes, please be more understanding and gracious that smoking is an addiction, a disease. Would you treat someone with Aids with such disdain? Oh yes, some of us still do. Users/SusanRoads

20100715 01:46:42 nbsp People need to find better things to do that hassle smokers. I occasionally smoke, but its very infrequent (maybe a couple cigarettes a month?). Breathing secondhand smoke once isnt going to give you cancer or make you addicted to nicotine. Its just an unpleasant smell, like body odor. I dont complain about the cars I need to bike next to, what with all their combustion emissions.

and if someone is smoking too close to you, politely ask them to stop. Smokers Ive met are all very courteous and are aware a lot of people dont like the smell (friends have asked if it was alright for them to light up before doing so, etc). Politely asking means saying something like excuse me, but Im sensitive to smoke and would appreciate it if you put your cigarette out. Remember to say thank you and do all of this without looking at the smoker like theyre rotting garbage. I know most people would be alright with this. Users/EugeneB
