Snapshot Sisters Photography consists of Jen and Rebecca, two local moms here in Davis. They have both been taking photos since they were kids and really started to develop a passion for photography in high school. Both are happily married and they have a total of 8 children between them (so their lives are just FULL of perfect photo opportunities).

Prices, discounts, and contests are available on their website (link above).  They specialize in family, children, maternity and newborn photography.  They also do engagement photos, weddings and special events. They love to shoot in natural light but also have a studio set up that they can travel with. Theyre happy to shoot in your home, yard, favorite parks, or anywhere special to you or your family.

 Davis has a variety of photographers!
