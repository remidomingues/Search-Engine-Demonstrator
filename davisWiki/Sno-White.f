SnoWhite was one of the first fast food restaurants in Davis.  Redrum Burger is now at this location.  Founded by Henry Nelson in the 1950s, Snowhite Drive In was a franchise that started out in Stockton.  The Davis location was one of many: at their peak there were a couple hundred locations in California, from Bakersfield to Chico, and two in Guam.   The menu consisted of burgers, fries, and softserve ice cream.


There are still some locations around, from the rather run down restaurant in http://www.yelp.com/biz/snowhitedriveinstockton Stockton to locations in http://www.snowhitefood.com/ Riverbank and Oakdale that host classic car shows.
