Just as a point of interest, the http://www.snopes.com/language/document/goodwife.asp Good Wife article is a fabrication.  Users/JabberWokky
 Thanks, JabberWokky. What I was trying to point out by saying life is necessary is that people have been alive continously for centuries before 1955, so it is not really saying much that people were alive when that was printed, and that furthermore do you really have such personal experience, or are you just passing something along you got from somewhere else? If it is the latter, then it seems similar to people who are opposed to abortion showing each other gory pictures. Users/NickSchmalenberger
     Main Entry: norm
     Pronunciation: norm
     Function: noun
     Etymology: Latin norma, literally, carpenters square
     1 : an authoritative standard : MODEL
     2 : a principle of right action binding upon the members of a group and serving to guide, control, or regulate proper and acceptable
     behavior
      I have given the first two definitions of norm from MW.com. This is because I am brain dead at the moment. There is a difference between a time periods norms and a time periods practice. It is ridiculous to argue that I dont know if The Good Wife is real, because this norm, or standard for proper behavior has been welldocumented by people who lived during that time and by historians alike. People are still alive today in 2006 who lived during the time period that The Good Wife (whether or not the image I post here is fabricated) was a standard for proper behavior for women. Like my grandparents, and many peoples grandparents, for example. Again, try The Feminine Mystique by Betty Friedan. Users/SnowBeige

20061125 20:08:40 nbsp The fact that the article is fake means that the text probably did not exist in 1955. So that article is no indication of what the norm or standard may have been. It is much more likely that it was written by people such as yourself in later times to scare other people just as you have done here on daviswiki. Why should I then believe you about how things actually were then when you werent there and your sources are fake? Why should the fact that people were alive during that time period convince me of anything? If it is so welldocumented why do you use a false document? Users/NickSchmalenberger

20061221 01:54:26 nbsp It seems to me like your attitude is dont let the facts get in the way of the truth, which is supposedly a quote from Maya Angelou. As for whether or not I am a sexist, I discriminate for and against people that I encounter based upon factors relevant to the unique situation. This could include situations such as separategender bathrooms, for example. I dont think, for example that one gender should categorically be paid more or less than another, if that is the sort of thing that you are referring to. I do understand that women may generally have been paid less and had somewhat fewer socially conventional roles during the 1950s. However, that doesnt change the fact that obedience to social convention is a matter of free will, and so blame of society for such problems does not excuse individuals from the need to change. This also doesnt change the fact that the document you presented is both exaggerated and, as Users/JabberWokky pointed out, fake. As such, it detracts  from education about the actual problems that existed then and exist today. I dont know where you get any idea of privacy, seeing as how you published this information on the public internet. As for my anonymity, that is absurd because I use my real name, as do the majority of users of this site, and you are in the minority who do not. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20061221 02:05:01 nbsp SnowBeige, as far as I understand, is a pen name used for the zine. This person is already on the wiki, but has created a second username to correspond to the zine pen name. Users/ArlenAbraham

20071122 13:04:25 nbsp hey thanks for the backup arlen. snowbeige is a penname of mine, and it shouldnt be part of the argument of me fabricating the patriarchy. oh sweet daviswiki, ive not traveled here in eons. well nick, while i can appreciate your free will model for social norms, the point you are arguing basically boils down to blaming the victim. ive heard your argument ad nauseum and i am not insulting you for that, but i highly suggest breaking out of your philosophy for beginners standpoint and pick up a few womens history books. the good wifes guide may be fake, but the norm was real and still is real to this day for MANY living breathing women on this earth. the feminine mystique is a good classic. peace out.
