Davis is a great place to live if you like snow but dont want to live smack in the middle of it all winter. Lake Tahoe resorts are 1.52 hours away in good weather without traffic.  If youre just looking for something cold to fall on, theres ice skating closer by, but still none in Davis.

On storm days, it can take 3x as long, or CHP can close highways for safety. Before your trip, call CalTrans at 8004277623 or check online if http://www.caltrans.ca.gov/cgibin/roads.cgi Chain Control is in effect. If your ride is not 4x4 or AWD, get tire chains. Way cheaper to buy at a local store like Kragen Auto Parts, Napa Auto Parts, or Les Schwab Tire Center in South Davis.


 Tahoe Ski Resorts 
  http://www.skialpine.com Alpine Meadows
   Alpine is a favorite of many hard riding locals because of the varied terrain, good vibes and inbounds backcountry.  Lift tickets are $64 during the regular season.
  http://www.borealski.com Boreal
   Boreal is the closest resort to Davis on the North Shore (up Interstate 80) and only costs $20 for college students on Fridays. Boreal is a small resort so it is best for beginners or people who want to ride their killer terrain parks.
  http://www.diamondpeak.com/ Diamond Peak
  http://www.donnerskiranch.com Donner Ski Ranch
   Donner Ski Ranch is located close to Boreal and Sugar Bowl. It is a small and cheap resort that is best suited for beginners. Although it does have some nice cliffs to drop off of on powder days.
  http://www.skiheavenly.com/ Heavenly
   With half of the mountain in California and half in Nevada, Heavenly offers beautiful views of Lake Tahoe.
  http://www.skihomewood.com/ Homewood
   Homewood is located right on the West Shore of Lake Tahoe so it has amazing views. It is small and fairly cheap but still has some steepish terrain and nice lines. Locals like it on powder days when the roads to the other resorts are hard to access. As an added benefit, it is nice and sheltered, so windy days at http://www.skihomewood.com Homewood are few and far between.
  http://www.kirkwood.com Kirkwood
   Kirkwood is one of the best resorts in Tahoe. Located on Highway 88, away from the rest of the area it takes a little bit longer to access than many resorts. Learn the shortcut through Fiddletown and it wont seem so far. Some terrain is steep  lots of chutes (but they tend to let up too soon), the parks are good and the snow is usually fantastic due to the high elevation, which means that along with the great snow there is usually a lot of wind. An excellent place on a powder day  Palisades takes all day to get tracked up. As an added bonus, Kirkwood is also very living cheaply student friendlyÂ— if you show them your current schedule, along with a student ID to prove youre a fulltime student, you can get a lift ticket for only $39, which is a great deal considering the normal price for an adult $59.
  http://www.mtrose.com/ Mount Rose
  http://www.northstarattahoe.com NorthstaratTahoe
   Jokingly reffered to as Flatstar, Northstars front side is pretty darn easy. The resort overrates their runs, turning blue squares in to black diamonds and greens in to blues. The Backside and Lookout Peak offer nice terrain for intermediate and above skiers. One nice thing is that there arent as many good people that ride here so powder can be found well in to the afternoon if you know where to look after a storm.
  http://www.sierraattahoe.com SierraatTahoe
   Sierra is the closest resort to Davis on the South Shore (up Hwy 50). Rather less challenging, but lots and lots of skiable terrain between the trails in the trees  excellent on a powder day.
  http://www.skisodasprings.com Soda Springs
   Soda Springs is a small, familyoriented ski resort located closer than Boreal on Hwy. 80. Great day trip for snow tubing (no sledding), learning to ski on bunny hill, a toddler Planet Kids zone complete with moving carpet and minisnowmobile track, and Kids X beginner terrain park. There are only 2 lifts, and a few trails.
  http://www.squaw.com Squaw Valley USA
   Squaw Valley, home of the 1960 Winter Olympics, is one of the largest resorts in the area. It attracts many of the regions most devoted ski bums due to the world class terrain (featuring a plethora of mogul runs usually covered in ice, but not much else). Absolutely the best steep skiing in northern CA  KT22 lift is never crowded  very few knuckledraggers because of the difficulty. It is the most expensive resort in Tahoe (season passes upwards of $1,000) and can be very crowded with long lines. The vibe can seem a little pretentious to a poor UC Davis student.
  http://www.sugarbowl.com Sugar Bowl
   Sugar Bowl is one of the closets resorts to Davis because you dont have to cross Donner Pass. It hosts great snow, nice steeps and plenty of terrain. While the parks usually suck, that is not why one goes to the bowl. This is an excellent resort.

 Central/Southern Sierra Resorts 
 These resorts are a VERY long way away from Davis.
  http://www.mammothmountain.com Mammoth Mountain
   Mammoth Mountain is located in the Eastern Sierras.  They boast an summit elevation of 11,053 feet and a large portion of the mountain lies above the tree line, giving you many open bowls to choose from.  Just for comparison Squaw Valleys highest peak is Granite Chief at 9050 feet.  The town is also has many fun restaurants, bars and many inexpensive places to stay.  The drive is about 5 hours from Davis.  Easiest way to get here is by driving through south Lake Tahoe and heading over the Kingsbury Grade and then hitting 395 south until you see the Mammoth Lakes turnoff.  The drive on 395 South is beautiful. For some great steeps and terrain check Mammoth out, it is well worth it.
  http://www.junemountain.com June Mountain
  http://www.bearvalley.com/ Bear Valley Bear Valley is hardly a long way from Davis. Davis to Truckee is about 115 miles and Davis to Bear Valley is about 150 miles. Bear Valley has two things to offer you as opposed to the Tahoe experience. No I80 traffic jams. No lift lines. Otherwise Bear Valley has decent terrain parks, decent snow, decent double blacks (albeit SHORT), and a laid back attitude.

20090730 02:23:54 nbsp I just got back from the Graeagle area... Suffice to say, its really nice. My advice is that you should try it if you like Tahoe, but would be willing to trade one big lake for a few dozen smaller ones, and basically no crowds to speak of. Users/JoePomidor

20100205 14:01:24 nbsp Does the Boreal deal for college students work for graduate students or do you actually have to be an undergrad?  Users/FloridianPlywood
  I havent done it in years, but the couple of times I went back as an undergrad they just wanted to see that you had a student ID.  I would be very surprised if A) they checked carefully enough to realize you were a grad student; or B) declined you the deal because of it. Users/TomGarberson

20100303 15:20:54 nbsp Im a Davis Enterprise reporter looking to head up to Northstar or Sierra this weekend (March 67) to capture local ski/snowboard feature story. If you think youve got something, ring me at 7478052 or email me at jedwards@davisenterprise.net Users/jon.edwards
