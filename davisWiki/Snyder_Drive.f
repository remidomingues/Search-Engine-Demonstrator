Address(Snyder Drive) forms part of a drive around Chestnut Park that is interrupted by bollards as to prevent car traffic. The bollards prevent it from connecting to Drexel Drive on the north and Haussler Drive on the south. There are two culdesacs that branch off to the west and have bike paths that connect to the park, Georgia Place, and Penny Place. Wahl Way provides a connection to Pole Line Road and the rest of town for cars.
