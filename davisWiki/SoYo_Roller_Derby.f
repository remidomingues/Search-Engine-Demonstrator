The SoYo Roller Derby League and their teams are dedicated to providing an opportunity for all women to challenge and strengthen themselves physically and mentally through the sisterhood of roller derby while supporting our community through volunteering and raising money for local charities. The SoYo Roller Derby League is a grassroots, DIY, skater owned and operated league with a commitment to promoting fitness and health for woman of all ages and sizes and to maintain an inclusive skating culture.

Our practices are held at the Norcal Indoor Sports Center, 1460 Tanforan Ave, Woodland CA
