(10/2004)I actually liked going here because there is never anyone else there.  They have a bunch of new washers and the dryers are usually pretty good.  Every once in a while a dryer will eat my quarters though.  Theres a couple tables and chairs, and a TV with cable, which is a treat as I dont have cable.  Since I have gone there, all of the folding surfaces and tables have been clean. The couch in there is nasty though and I am afraid to sit on it. Users/JanelleAlvstadMattson


(11/2006)They now have a jukebox and vending machines and specials such as discounts for doing your laundry early in the day or on Tuesdays. I think the owner is making a real effort to jazz the place up. I enjoy doing my laundry here and have never found it to be grimy or nasty in any way.  Users/MarieBoisvert

20090307 09:57:06 nbsp Nice place, clean and all the machines seem to be in good working condition. Went there early Saturday morning to wash blankets and quilts, and brought along a few loads of regular laundry. The commercial machines were easy to use (I wont use as much detergent next time...didnt need it). I was pretty into my book and didnt do much exploring. I didnt notice if there was a TV or jukebox. Some of the seating is a little dodgy. Pretty quiet except for the machines. Only one other person doing laundry, but lots of foot traffic over at Curves at that time of the morning. Still, its a little isolated from the street with few windows, so patrons should try to stay alert particularly if theyre alone. Users/DukeMcAdow


20110911 13:25:33 nbsp Just confirmed the above closure.  I thought maybe they were swapping out their old machines, but nope...Theyre closed. Im going to miss this place, not so much because it was great, but because it was rarely so busy that I had to wait for a free dryer (unlike the Laundry Lounge, which will now be even more crowded).
