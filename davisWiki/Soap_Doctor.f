The Soap Doctor is a local project by Dagon Jones.  He makes handmade soaps.  The soap is available for trade and for purchase.  All profits from the soap sales go directly to buy equipment and necessities for Dr. Jones volunteer dental work at the Willow dental clinic.
Currently soaps are available at Redwood Barn Nursery and Apex Cycles.

Both variants I was able to examine smelled absolutely wonderful, its instantly apparent that quality ingredients were used in this project. My buddy who then actually got to use said soap also had great things to say. The mint was really minty, it left a tingle while the lemon was extremely zesty. Users/StevenDaubert
