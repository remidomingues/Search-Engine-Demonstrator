What the Davis police do to you to determine if you are drunk:

  Follow their finger with your eyes
  Reach out with your pointer finger, and then touch your nose with your eyes closed
  Take 9 steps, toe to heel, do a 3point 180 turn, and walk 9 steps again
  Quietly and with your eyes closed, estimate the passage of 30 seconds
  Stand with oneknee raised for 30 seconds (they will test both legs)

During this whole time, they will attempt conversation with you, like Where were you tonight? Was it pretty crowded? How good are their drinks? It sounds like they are trying to be your friend, but its a way for them to tell how coherent your speech and thoughts are. So be cool, and if you really are drunk, discipline yourself to speak only with words fewer than two syllables.

It will take about 15 minutes, good enough time to piss your pants. Sometimes, theyll breathalyze you at the end, rather than at the beginning of the test.


Aggie Band Bandsmen familiar with the Hiber Drill should be able to do the last one sober or not.  It helps if you yell Yoooo!  when you do it.  Users/AllisonEriksen
