Many University Departments departments at UCD conduct behavioral experiments with humans. Since there is no campuswide coordinator to facilitate cooperation between departments, and logistical difficulties (eg, ownership, responsibility, design approval, etc.) make it difficult to create a page, we are using this wiki to do so. Feel free to add to and/or edit this page.

Participating in some of these studies is a great way to earn some extra cash as an Undergraduate Students undergraduate. Pay attention to bulletin boards seeking volunteers and email for more info. Sometimes its something as simple as hanging out and playing board games for an hour to earn $25. Its fun, it helps out researchers and it can earn you some extra dough.

 Who cares about this page? 

Experimenters in various departments may want to know what others are doing, what software they are using and/or want to give/receive help in carrying out experiments. They should be able to find each other here.

Students may want to participate in experiments in various departments. They should be able to learn more on this page.

If you want to know more about experimental economics, check out http://www.icesgmu.org/index.php this page at Vernon Smiths Interdisciplinary Center for Economic Science. Smith won the Nobel Prize for http://www.icesgmu.org/article.php/396.html his experimental work in 2002.

 Departments and Groups Doing Experiments 

http://econlab.ucdavis.edu/ Economics sometimes recruiting subjects for market games.  Register at http://econlab.ucdavis.edu and then respond to an invitation for scheduled sessions.  Compensation is on average $15 for an hour session, and is at least $5 simply for showing up to the experiment. Contact: http://www.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/schipper/ Burkhard C. Schipper

http://www.agecon.ucdavis.edu/ Agricultural & Resource Economics (http://www.agecon.ucdavis.edu:8080/casselWeb2/viewCalendar.do Sign up for Experiments). Contact: http://tlybbert.ucdavis.edu Travis Lybbert.
Students: Mailto(djzetland AT ucdavis DOT edu, David Zetland) has done Public Good and Auction experiments with undergrads and water executives using CASSELL and zTree.  Mailto(crgustafson AT ucdavis DOT edu, Christopher Gustafson) is interested in doing experiments on information, learning, and demand analysis. Mailto(drheres AT ucdavis DOT edu, David R. Heres Del Valle) is expecting to implement lab experiments in order to test the performance of different institutional frameworks for cap and trade schemes.

 1. get an idea
 1. get some money
 1. design experiment (computer or not, lab or field)
 1. get IRB approval
 1. schedule sessions
 1. recruit subjects
 1. run experiment, pay subjects, collect data
 1. analyze, write and publish!

 Funding Sources 

Each of the following has been used to support social science experiments by UCD researchers.  Please add other (even potential) sources of funding.

  http://www.nsf.gov NSF supports social scienceand otherresearch with multiple types of grants and fellowships.
  http://www.sigmaxi.org Sigma Xi supports social scienceand otherresearch with small http://www.sigmaxi.org/programs/giar/ GIAR grants (up to $1000).
  http://www.wennergren.org WennerGren supports anthropological research with multiple types of grants.

 Software for Experiments 

  http://exlab.bus.ucf.edu/Registration/Admin/adminlogon.cfm ExLab webbased software from U Florida for managing experiments and subjects (free  but you must contact them for an account).
  http://veconlab.econ.virginia.edu/introduction.php Veconlab webbased software for online economic experiments with over 50 templates (free)
  http://www.iew.unizh.ch/ztree/index.php zTree PCsoftware for experiments (free with signed use agreement). zTree has a helpful http://www.iew.unizh.ch/ztree/support.php#mailinglist mailing list, too.
  Gameweb, a webbased experimental game platform initially developed by Richard McElreath and funded by the NSF.  The platform is built on PHP/MySQL and runs on an Apache server.  It is currently in the process of being opensourced as a http://sourceforge.net/ SourceForge project.

 Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval 

To protect subjects, all UCDbased principal investigators are required to get http://www.research.ucdavis.edu/IRBAdmin IRB approval before beginning experiments (or any form of research involving human subjects). The IRB process was developed to prevent unethical research or research that could expose its human subjects to unreasonable risk. This concern was spurred by wiki:WikiPedia:Human_experimentation#History_of_human_experimentation historical precedent.  However, the experiments discussed in this DavisWiki article are distinguished from the majority of IRB cases because they are behavioral experiments and completely noninvasive.  The IRB process seems overlycomplicated for simple behavioral experiments, but its required. Nobody disagrees with the need for an IRBlike process overseeing all human experiments, but many people hope a separate institution could govern nonmedical research in the social and behavioral sciences. Luckily, noninvasive experiments can often be reviewed and approved using the expedited form in about a week.

 Facilities @ UCD 

  93 Hutchison can be reserved by UCD experimenters for free. Contact MailTo(labreserve AT ucdavis DOT edu). They have zTree installed on the 30 computers there.

 How to Recruit & Schedule Students 

Flyers, ads in California Aggie the Aggie, inclass announcements, email to listservs, facebook(?)

http://www.ssel.caltech.edu/info/ CASSELL webbased software from CalTech for managing experiments and subjects (free  but you must set it up on your own server).

 Other Resources 

  http://www.economicscience.org/Calendar/default.asp Economic Science Association organizes conferences and runs listservs for jobs, conferences and experimental methodology.
  http://www.icesgmu.org/subcategory.php/106.html Visiting Graduate Student Workshop in Experimental Economics at ICES is an excellent way to learn about different experimental methods & theory and meet people who do lots of experiments & students interested in them. The workshop takes place in midJuly and is free. You will earn enough money from participating to pay most or all of your travel, food and lodging expenses. Applications are due March 15.
