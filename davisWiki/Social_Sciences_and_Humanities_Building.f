The Social Sciences and Humanities Building (SOCSCI), designed by Southwest architect http://www.predock.com/ Antoine Predock, is a complex, fivestoried, mazelike building of classrooms, labs, and offices. SSH 2203, the Andrews Room, is the main conference room (max. occupancy 49).

It is commonly referred to as the Death Star by students because of its shiny metallic appearance from the outside (reminiscent of the Death Star from Star Wars), as well as the fact that architecturally it is such a maze. The glassedin catwalk between the two center wings is just begging for a lightsaber duel.

Predocks design philosophy is very concerned with how the structure interacts with its surroundings. He has called his style abstract landscape; thus he blends the structure in with the surrounding landscape FootNote(http://www.archpedia.com/Architects/AntoinePredock.html). The building also interacts with the people who use it. It was supposedly designed on purpose to be confusing. Visitors are often forced to talk to someone to find out how to get to where they need to go. Doorways that you need to pass through will sometimes be locked, forcing you to find a new way. The doors that get locked rotate every so often, further confusing the situation. The idea was to force human interaction because it houses the social sciences. The building also has a number of Emergency Buttons, colloquially referred to as Panic Buttons located throughout. If youd prefer to just look at a map, though, these http://wireless.ucdavis.edu/socscihummap.cfm wireless coverage maps are a good way to find the room number you need.

Supposedly, if you were to fly over the building, it looks like a topographic map of California. However, the resemblance is loose at best, as can be seen from this aerial photo (rotated for clarityNorth is actually to the left).  The building is supposed to be a http://wwwgeology.ucdavis.edu/fun/geologyrocks/sosci.html metaphor for Californias geography.

The buildings two center wings are set at angles that slope upward, simulating the geological uplift that formed the western Coast Range and Sacramento Valley.  Their silver color also echoes the granite of the eastern Sierra Nevada Mountains.

Also, the curve of the walkway which winds through the bottom level of the structure is reminiscent of the many rivers which wind through Northern California.  In the original design, the plants on the bottom level were to be tomatoes and other local natives, like California bunchgrass.  But the extreme heat from the reflective steel proved too much for some of them.

From the architects web site: The University is in Californias Central Valley, an area with a rich agricultural heritage.  Watercourses carve through the surrounding fields.  The building is an analogous composition: a curvilinear pedestrian route passes through  the lowlying blocks of the buildings aligned with the campus and fields.  These blocks form a base for upthrust, sloping pieces that house offices and afford distant views.  These pieces are clad in metal and at times seem to dissolve into the sky.

And from an interview in the http://ucdavismagazine.ucdavis.edu/issues/win07/campus_views.html Winter 2007 UC Davis Magazine: When I would fly over the San Joaquin Valley, I noticed that the San Joaquin River Delta seemed to interrupt the gridlike parcels which surrounded it, recalls Predock. I wanted to incorporate this sense of regional topography into the building. Like the delta, the pathway at the base of the building is a twisted spine that connects the various departments, which are colored in varying shades of beige or gray.

The architecture certainly is striking:


It really isnt this grim looking in person.  Some of the architectural details are downright lighthearted, like the juxtaposition of outdoor carpet with indoor tile, or the fuzzy rooms.  People have been known to describe the style as Brutalism Lite, but this label is meaningful only in the vaguest possible sense.


Drunk Drunken students often make their way to the top of the west tower (which houses the library for Agricultural and Resource Economics) late at night, as the tower commands a view of most of the bits of Campus campus that are worth looking at.  Similarly, Davis youth have been known to go to the top of the building with outdated CRT monitors, only to throw them off the roof and watch them crash to the ground.  (It should be noted that the university frowns upon both these practices.)

Also, a very good place to play Ball Tag. Its also a GREAT place to play both Sardines and Ditch. When you arrive, go to the bottom level by the elevator in the middle. There are some very cool Places to Hide places to hide here.  There are also many games of capture the flag played there, by college students and other Davis citizens alike. Its also a good place for Davis Urban Gaming Group Nerf Wars, but sometimes the cops get called by people who cant tell the difference between an actual sidearm and a large neonorangeandyellow chunk of plastic.

The Death Star is also rumored to be the secret headquarters of the Campus Crusade for Chaos and Confusion.

Several LARP liveaction roleplaying games are held here on various nights.

Theres these long cubby hole windows on, what I believe is the ground floor of the Death Star. With proper tools; blankets and a curtain or something, Sex could very well be had in them. They are just outside the Political Science office, below Philosophy.

The Roland Marchand room in the History Department is a Study Spots good place to study, although sometimes youll get chased out of it and it closes at night. There is also a social sciences computing lab in the basement that you need a Professors professors permission to use. SSH houses Agricultural and Resource Economics, Economics, History, Political Science, Sociology and a weird Psychology Lab building on the ground floor.

Not everybody likes the design of the building (though certainly the administrative officials that approved it and the architect loved it).  Upon its completion in 1995 it replaced a parking lot, which was the site of the original Unitrans depot. Before that, this was the approximate location of the football field before it was moved a bit north to become the Toomey Field you know today.

The http://www.crsi.org/ Concrete Reinforcing Steel Institute selected the building for one of its 1996 Design Awards.

20080101 17:52:49 nbsp Has anyone entered the main office for the college of L&S? Apparently students are not permitted to use the the hallway to the left  ever. Ive walked in their two times to ask directions for something, and each time that hallway would have served as a shortcut. I was interrupted before walking down the hall by a secretary, who said its off limits. I tried to get clarity by asking, Students are allowed to go down there? and she nodded, affirming it. Does anyone else think that is strange? Users/AndrewBianchi

20081004 23:24:46 nbsp Yeah, watch out when using elevators in this building. I am not sure if it is the same all around the place but the elevators near the History department are unreliable. You could easily get stuck and be stranded. A very scary experience to be stuck in those rickety elevators! Users/TomLin

 Youre talking about the tower with the elevator shaft and the glass door interrupting the staircase to the top? Thats not actually the highest spot here... but Ill let you figure out what is higher on your own. Happy exploring! wl

20091028 00:56:44 nbsp Go through the History Department or enter at the ground floor from the northern glass doors leading to the Deans office of the Letters and Science Division. Doors lock at 5 PM. The walkway is on the 4th and 5th floor. 5th floor has a stair case that goes to a look out of the school. Very pretty view up there with some fine graffiti. Theres also a bunch of plastic windmills up there right now. Users/ChiakiHirai

Young man: Could you tell me where the Social Science building is?
Older woman: You just walked out of it.

It is the first day of the quarter, but it was still pretty funny. Users/Michellaneous

20110516 09:23:07 nbsp Have anyone ever wondered why some exterior part of the building has the glossy silver plates while some are just ugly concrete not even painted?( even inside social science lecture hall?) is it because it is unfinished or something due to budget problems? or is it supposed to be like this...i doubt it tho, anyone?? this has bothered me for 2 years now but no one seems to know... Users/BruceLeung

20110608 22:22:34 nbsp Bruce: Yes, its definitely supposed to be like that. The architect who designed the building (an expert in the field of chaos perspective) was in fact experimenting with nonEuclidean structural geometria, and the framework is not entirely contained within the three dimensions we know. Part of what makes this work is the morphic resonance of bare concrete. The carefully arranged metal plates covering the concrete in some regions act as a dimensional Faraday cage, containing and redirecting the ley flow, but paint on the concrete would just ruin the whole effect. In fact the main reason that maintenance is so strict about vandalism on this particular building is that too much paint on the walls would overload the perspective circuitry, disrupting the foundations and possibly causing the whole structure to collapse! Users/BarnabasTruman
  All I got from that was I can bring down the building with just paint. BRB... Users/hankim
    What I got was that the metal plates may have to be replaced and/or reoriented soon, as the removal of the The Domes could plausibly shift the ley lines.  More importantly, if their axis is in alignment, it explains the phrase that keeps running through my head: Paladins of Esparto, as Esparto lies directly in alignment with their orientation. ⁓Users/JabberWokky ʝ⍵
     Im still going to NOT GO WITH THE PAINT THING ANY AND ALL OFFICERS OF THE LAW WHO MIGHT BE READING THIS. Users/hankim
     Actually, the Domes were specifically designed with a variety of zeroimpact environmental concerns in mind, including complete noninterference with ley lines. The rounded shape allows the flow to just pass right over them. (Over isnt strictly accurate, but its the closest threedimensional approximation of the actual direction. Imagine two Klein bottles tied together with a Moebius loop and youll have a pretty good idea.) Users/BarnabasTruman

20110726 16:13:15 nbsp thanks for the response BarnabasTruman, but then how come some of the concrete are covered with cream/yellowish grey color of paint but not all? and how did you know the story behind the placement of the metal plates? i just thought it would be so much better looking if its all metal plated, but those plates look pretty expensive tho.

20110918 00:00:40 nbsp I had about 8 minutes to find my way to Undergraduate Education & Advising (200 SSH). Holy Primus, I spent a good 34 of those 8 minutes trying to figure out how to get through the Escherian madness. I swear SSH looks like something youd find on Cybertron.  Users/Metallikato

20120318 00:04:47 nbsp I once had to teach a course on the lower floor of the death star. It featured poor lighting, only one chalkboardcompared to other rooms that have 34 sliding boardsand had one wall of solid glass. I felt like I was a test subject at some sort of scientific zoo, in which administrators were going to stand by with clipboards and study the effects of teaching in a horrible classroom. Luckily, I was able to move the course on the third day. I pity anyone has had to teachor learn in that room.  Users/Profe
  Actually I specifically requested that room for a class I taught during the summer. Ive dreamed of teaching a class in the Death Star for years, and was overjoyed to finally get a chance. It was everything Id ever hoped for and more. Users/BarnabasTruman

20140330 00:13:15 nbsp Has anyone created a guide to finding your way around the Deathstar?  All Ive found so far is the wireless coverage map, which sucks.

Im thinking about using some free time this quarter to begin a project on creating a database with directions to each area of the building.  Users/SnowDay

20140819 14:10:38 nbsp MAP!: I scanned a map packet we keep at the front desk! It looks lowres but just zoom in. http://sociology.ucdavis.edu/contact/SSHMap.pdf Users/Metallikato
