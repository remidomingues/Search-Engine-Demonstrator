I feel like a number... Im not a number   Bob Seger

In America, everyone is a really just a number.  So when you need a new one, or a copy of your old one, visit the Social Security Administrations local Field Office. Although a bus from downtown Sacramento stops (every hour) at the office it is strongly advisable to go from Davis by car if you dont want to spend all day on public transport. If you dont have one, you could Car Rental rent one. Take Interstate 80 the 80 east, exit at Reed, turn left, pass the CHP station on your right, make a left on Riverside Parkway, and it will be on your left.
