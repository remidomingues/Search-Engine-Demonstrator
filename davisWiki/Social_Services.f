 Social Learning Dance Program: Adults  Adults with SOCIAL ANXIETY can improve their social skills in a fun and nonthreatening way through social dance.  Dancing lessons help you effectively interact with your peers while learning a skill at the same time.  Improved social skills enable individuals to accomplish a wide range of social tasks from asking for directions from a stranger to saying no to someone who is trying to persuade them to do something they do not want to do. These skills are also critical for success in the work environment where interacting with coworkers is a necessary job skill. MONTHLY DANCE PROGRAM: Each month a new dance is taught.  Lessons are held on Saturday during the day. After the 1 hour dance lesson the group has lunch together at a nearby pizza restaurant. Fee: The Dance Program costs $96 per month. You can participate for one month or monthly.  If you are interested in learning more about the program contact:  MARILYN L PERRY, PHD  9162846712 or email marilynlperry@yahoo.com
