UC Davis has a student run Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) club for Graduate Students graduate and undergraduate students interested in applied mathematics. This is not only for mathematics math majors but also people who study engineering, physics, chemistry, biology, statistics, or social sciences. The only requirement is a general interest in mathematical techniques used to solve problems in any field.

The club meets occasionally at the math science building for social events and meetings for organizing a research conference. For more information contact Kristin Lui the communication director at siam@ucdavis.edu.
