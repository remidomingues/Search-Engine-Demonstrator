The Society of Davis Wiki Restaurant Reviewers (SWRR, pronounced Sour) is a secret society of Wikians who anonymously visit Davis restaurants for the purpose of writing accurate reviews. They clandestinely make note of the food offered, friendliness, helpfulness, and speed of service, the freshness, variety, arrangement, etc. of food. They note prices, menu details, etc. All with the goal of providing honest and accurate independent information to the Davis Wiki readership. This is their only publicly released information.

Their meeting places, schedules, membership, secret handshakes, etc. are totally unknown at present. Some have reported their secret gesture to be a finger pointing down the throat, or the pinching of the nostrils, or a hand over the crotch, but these are unconfirmed.

All disciples work towards the highest level of achievement: the Dark Belt. No living member has yet achieved the Dark Belt level.

Some say that reading How to write an effective restaurant review is a first step in preparation for getting into the Society. The only way to get in is to be chosen.

Ive heard it rumored that you also need to tell someone in the society that you want to be in.  I take this to mean that they have not yet developed their psychic powers to the full maximum.  It is also rumored that the more people join, the more psychic power the society develops.

Being a highly S.E.C.R.E.T. society, nobody knows whos a member, so theres no one to ask. Probably the best way to get noticed is to walk around doing one or more of the secret gestures mentioned above. Do this where large numbers of people will see you. A member may notice and invite you to initiation.


20051114 20:31:51 nbsp It seems against the communal nature of the wiki to have an official group like this... Users/JackHaskel
  Problems could stem from the officialsounding use of the word wiki.
    Nowhere is the word official used, and what would that be anyway? Would it mean Philip approved it? Or everyone who ever used the wiki approved it? I think everyone here knows its no more official than Hacking Society, or than any page on anything here. It has wiki in the name, since its obviously wiki related. Was never intending to claim any special rights or priviledge (and am surprised it could have been construed thusly). Society was a jab at the alltooserious way some groups take themselves. Im sure Hacking Society was named that for the same reason. I mean, how serious could a few people that eat lunch together possibly be?

20051114 22:07:08 nbsp Its not against the communal nature of the wiki, because if youd like to, you can come with us, Jack! Nobodys excluded, of course. This is by wikians, for wikians. Users/JohnDudek

20051124 23:51:44 nbsp that photo is so unflattering, and blurry, and I think the society will be everchanging, and anonymous.. Id like to delete the photo but i will instead just comment Users/MichelleAccurso
  Sure its blurry, it has that spycam quality, it also gives a hint of anonymity. The intention was more to show the mood than the facial details. I dont think it shows anyone in a negative light, or I wouldnt have posted it. I think it adds more than it detracts. This being the wiki, if you are offended you can remove it.
