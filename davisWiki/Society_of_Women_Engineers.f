As everyone knows, College of Engineering engineering is full of pale, geeky males.  In most of the engineering classes, you could seat all the chicks in a row and, just for kicks, throw in all the guys with long hair too, but still not be able to fill up one whole row of the lecture hall.  SWE exists to support and promote the existence of female engineers.  They offer various programs to help new students get adjusted to college life, as well as programs throughout the year to help continuing students prepare for internships and the life beyond the university.
