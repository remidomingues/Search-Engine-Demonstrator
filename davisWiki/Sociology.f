The Undergraduate Program consists of two majors:

Sociology Major: Sociology covers a broad range of subject material and a wider range of theory and methods than most majors. Auguste Comte, a founding father of the discipline, referred to sociology as the Queen of the Sciences because it embodies the basics of all the other social sciences.

The department has developed four distinct programs of study within the sociology major. Students selecting the Sociology major may choose from four options (also referred to as emphasis) within this major:

 General: Allows students to obtain a broad understanding of the concepts, methods, and theories of sociology

 Law and Society: Designed for students interested in law (probation, enforcement, delinquency) & politics. Law and Society also has some flexibility; expect to take courses in delinquency, deviance, law, criminology and social problems.

 Social Services: Designed for students interested in social work agencies, public service, counseling and related areas. It also allows flexibility in course selection. Required courses include social problems, social stratification, the family, social welfare, research methods, and ethnic studies.

 Comparative Studies and World Development: This area is designed for students interested in the development of industrial and developing societies. Particular attention focuses on the relationship between todays developing countries and the more advanced nations of the international system. This course work is interdisciplinary, and students can expect to take classes in Economics, Anthropology, Geography, Political Science and History. Careers pursued by students majoring in sociology include work in public and private research firms, city planners and teachers, as well as political organizations.


The SociologyOrganizational Studies Major: The SociologyOrganizational Studies Major is designed to develop a broad understanding of the political, social, and economic organizations that comprise modern society. The major introduces students to a range of theories and methods that social scientists use in the analysis of organizations.

20100129 08:34:26 nbsp I got interested in sociology after taking Professor Bill McCarthys Social Problems class (SOC 3) back in Winter 2003.  That class became one of the defining features of my time as an undergrad here.  It also got me interested in both law and policy, and played a big part in my eventual decision to go to law school.  Last I checked someone else was taking Soc 3, but if you have a chance to take any class with Prof. McCarthy, jump on it!  Its a decent amount of work, but you wont regret it.  Drew Halfmanns Political Sociology class (118) was also particularly memorable, and is worth a look if youre interested in politics, regardless of your major.  Users/TomGarberson

20110117 11:21:18 nbsp I took one class in Sociology, and it was absurd. My discussion leader (TA) opined that White people can never really feel discriminated against, and another TA used personal insults to critique my midterm, saying that it appeared to have been written by a kindergartner, and that I did not appear to have the talents required to obtain a degree. Needless to say, I hurried back to the Engineering side of campus, and never took another Sociology class. Users/JoePomidor
