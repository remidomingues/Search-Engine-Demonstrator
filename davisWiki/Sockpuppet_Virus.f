Recently, a barrage of real people have been infected by the Front Page Davis Wiki Sockpuppet Virus. Were not quite sure how it is transferred from wiki user to wiki user, but we know one thing for sure: the icon is darn cute.

 Sockpuppet Virus Spreading Documentation 

If you have been infected by the virus, document how you received it so we can find out who might be the Sockpuppet Mary.

  Sockpuppet Mary  No one knows their real identity.
   ?? Unknown Chain ??
    Users/JabberWokky  Self inflicted?
     Users/WesHardaker when Users/JabberWokky intentionally infected his Users/WesHardaker/Testing page.
      Users/EdHenn Ed Henns socks smell funny now because Users/WesHardaker had to pass it on to someone after all...
       Users/PhilipNeustrom Philip Wilt Chamberlain Neustrom contracted the virus from Users/EdHenn during one of his 10,000 Wiki encounters...  Then, he was miraculously cured!  Alas, he was left with a SockPuppet/Talk tragic physical condition that has adversely affected his ability to edit.
    Users/WilliamLewis  Very likely self inflicted.
    Users/DavidGrundler  Bought a supply to infect the below?  The tricky thing was how he affected Arlen after Arlen infected Jason.  We suspect a time machine was involved here.  (Or is it that the virus has a random amount of time where it is active but hasnt manifested itself.  Some can be infected for weeks without showing the telltale sign, while others exhibit the telltale sign immediately upon infection...)

 Preventing Infection 

As mentioned, how it spreads is unknown.  However, staying away from infected users will likely help.  Always practice safe editing!

 Origin 

While the origin is unknown, it is worth noting that the virus appeared shortly after the Philip Neustrom Theory Neustromnomic theory Philip Neustrom Theory Number One number one was violated.  It is possible that the wiki itself is generating this darn cute icon to balance reality.
