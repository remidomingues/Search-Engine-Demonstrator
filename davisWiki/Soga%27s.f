 History 

Sogas began as a local restaurants restaurant that offered upscale restaurants upscale dining.  Prior to being located on E Street, Sogas used to be located at 222 D Street, until the Mustard Seed took the spot.  The original chef and restaurants namesake was Chef Matt Soga, who was followed by executive chef Roger Duran, formerly of the San Francisco wiki:sf:Presidio Caf√©.

In June of 2007, Sogas went through some changes. New owners, new management, a new chef, new menu and new wine list.  Their menu featured items like organic salads and organic beef (from Niman Ranch).  Some people believe the dessert menu was very tasty and definitely worth a try. The chef was Ricardo Roa who was with Sogas for 10 years and the General Manager was Users/Cliff Cliff Mohr followed by Jay Mundi.  They offered a full service bar with two HD big screen TVs.  Wednesday through Saturday nights they offered a nightclub with music and dancing starting about Night Time 10 PM.

In December 2008, the Chaat Cafe (also called Cafe 217) replaced Sogas at this location, followed by Agave.  In September 2010 it changed from Agave back to Sogas again.
