Greetings fellow KoL player.  At least, http://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/Soggy_wofl_tshirt I think so.  You can make a page here if you like, and Welcome to the Wiki.  Users/BrentLaabs

Hi, I saw your post for CL Davies page. As an unwilling resident of her property for 5 years now (I signed the initial lease with Lyon) I am fed up and seriously considering a lawsuit. Please let me know if youre interested in being a part of it by responding to my post directly under yours in the CL D page. All the best, JIK Users/JIK
