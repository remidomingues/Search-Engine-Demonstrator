Sojourner Truth Garden apartments is a rental housing community developed and managed by Community Housing Opportunities Corporation CHOC for very low, low and moderate income households. Sojourner Truth also provides a Resident Services program which provides residents with professional staff to assist them in enhancing the quality of life within their residential communities and achieving individual personal goals.

In December 1988, Davis Community Housing (now CHOC) purchased this fourteenunit complex and significant rehabilitation work was completed throughout the following year. Acquisition and rehabilitation was funded by HUD, the State Department of Housing and Community Development, the California Housing Finance Agency, the City of Davis Housing Trust Fund, and proceeds of the syndication of Federal lowincome housing tax credits. All units are affordable to households earning less than 60% of Yolo Countys median income.
