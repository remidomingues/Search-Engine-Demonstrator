EDIT:  Effective February 26th 2010, Solano Clinical Research is no longer in business, according to http://www.solanoclinicalresearch.com

Solano Clinical Research performs wiki:WikiPedia:Clinical_trials#Phase_III Phase III wiki:WikiPedia:Clinical_trials clinical trials for http://www.dowpharm.com Dow Pharmaceutical Sciences and Merck on all manner of Davisarea residents, mostly students looking to make a quick buck.

Many of the studies involve testing topical ointments for irritation, photosensitivity, etc. More recently, theyve been doing studies for vaccines including wiki:WikiPedia:Smallpox Smallpox and wiki:WikiPedia:Human_papillomavirus HPV.

Some hold that theres a riteofpassage aspect to participating in their skinirritation studies.

While most trials do not pay lots of money quickly, all of them do offer a fair compensation and can last anywhere from a few hours to two+ years.

They often advertise in The California Aggie, but interested guinea pigs can call the phone number to find out about current trials.

They have since relocated to Vallejo. (see their site).
