The Solar Filling Station is a battery charging station for cell phones and MP3 players. It is located in the outdoor patio area of the Oak Tree Plaza. A fully functional piece of town art, the pump is completely free to use. However, since the solar power charging process is rather slow, you will probably want to insert a quarter for one of the two storage lockers so you dont have to stand there forever like a fool. This deposit is refunded to you upon return of the locker key. If you leave to shop for an hour, you might be lucky enough to get an increase of about 15% charge on a modern smartphone.
