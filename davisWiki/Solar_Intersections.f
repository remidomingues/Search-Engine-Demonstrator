On 2nd Street in front of the Train Station train station there is a tall piece of Town Art art titled Solar Intersections.  It was created in 1989 by Robert Behrens.

The statue is covered in holographic material that shimmers with rainbows when you look at it, particularly under the bright summer sun.  It is similar to the spinning discs found in nature stores in the mall.

The holographic Mylar was replaced a couple of years ago, but it degrades fairly quickly in sunlight. Many outdoor sculptures in the 1980s used this material, before the product lifespan was known.
