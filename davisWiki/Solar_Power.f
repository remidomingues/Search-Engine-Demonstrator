Save the environment by harnessing the power of the sun!  Solar power is becoming increasingly popular in Davis.  We even have a Solar Filling Station.

 Communities 


  On Campus Coops  A large array behind Ag Effort, in the organic garden

 Useful information 

Invaluable information for the person designing their own solar system:

For a gridtie system (thats almost every installation in Davis) all that matters is the average energy output. Solar panels are rated by power, not energy. Heres the magic conversion for the Davis area:

  Energy (kWh)/day  .0037  panel rating (STC watts)
  Energy (kWh)/year  1.35  panel rating (STC watts)

Example: You have a typical 200 Watt panel. 200 Watts  1.35  270 kWh/year (worth about $30) will be produced by that panel. Panels like this cost around $700 as of 2010. The panel is perhaps half the total installed system cost.

These magic numbers (.0037 and 1.35) assume fixedmount flatplate solar panel(s) are south facing, at latitude tilt (38.5 degrees), loss factor (DCAC conversion, dust, thermal derating, etc.) is 67%, 5.5 insolation factor for this latitude and specific region (cloud cover, etc.), year average.
