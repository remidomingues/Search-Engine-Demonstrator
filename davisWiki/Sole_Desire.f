20130321 08:02:27 nbsp LOVE THE SHOES! If you need some good shoes most definitely come here!!

But if you looking to work here think twice! I was just a customer and had to witness the manager (Jen) screaming curse words at her employee. Telling her she needed to hurry up because she moved as slow as snail shit. Literally she used the F word three times within 5 min!! I have shopped here before and have felt very pressured to buy from the manager. Every time I go in she has the least respect I have ever seen when it comes to her employees. Not a healthy work environment!  Users/ILoveDavis55
