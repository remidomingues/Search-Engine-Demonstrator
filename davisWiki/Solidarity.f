wiki:WikiPedia:Solidarity Solidarity is also the name of a Polish trade union that was founded by wiki:WikiPedia:Lech Wałęsa, who later spoke at Freeborn Hall. Feliks (sp?), the janitor at Patwin School, was also a member of the group, and when Lech came to Davis they met at the hall, and the Davis Enterprise had a picture of them shaking hands.
