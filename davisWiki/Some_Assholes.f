Users/DonovanKelley and Users/TaylorStreet are part of the incestuous Davis Music Scene. They are members of The Backups, Keep Your Distance, and BxUxIx.

Some Assholes play powerviolence, fastcore, sludge or something like that. There is no way you could be cool enough to know. Stop listening to Modest Mouse and start listening to something with some balls (the music, not the musicians).
