Sonia Chapiro loves that oldtime rock and roll, and fake cheese sauce. She made this page because she thought she lost her cat. This was very distressing, as her cat is her best friend. He came back about a day later.




Rock on!  May your cat always come back, and welcome to the wiki!  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
