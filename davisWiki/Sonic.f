wiki:Woodland:Sonic is a classic 50s style drivein.  You have the option of the drivethru, parking and ordering from your car, or ordering from one of the walkup menu boards next to the outside seating area.  Most parking spaces have a menu with speakers.  There are also parking spaces on the west side of the building where you can park and sit at one of the outside tables.  After you order, a server will bring you your food, usually via roller skates! (The server is on roller skates, not the food.)  Each menu board includes a card reader for payment purposes.  You can slide your credit/atm/gift card in the slot, and the server will bring your receipt with your food.  You can also check your Sonic gift card balance at any of these card readers.  To pay with cash, just wait for the server to bring your food.

If youre unsure of what to order, try a frozen berry lemonade slushee, or a cherry limeade. It is pretty well known for its happy hour drink specials. That means 1/2 priced drinks from 24.

Its a good place to go if you want to get some frozen drinks or fast food for cheap.

When this Sonic opened, there was a 4hour wait to experience all that Sonic had to offer. In fact, it was so popular that they had to block it off and wave people away. The crowds have since calmed down and you usually wont have an issue with getting a parking spot.

Onion rings are good, but not great. They are made with whole rings, not chopped pressed onions. They used to have a a Philly Cheese Steak that wasnt on the menu. It appears to have dissappeared. The California burger is better than the plain cheeseburger.  And yesthey have grilled cheese (if you order the kids meal, chances are youll wind up with a toy).

Try the tater tots if you are deciding between fries and tots.

They serve their entire menu all day.  So you can get breakfast anytime or a burger at 8am.

20051224 20:57:08 nbsp i get pretty pumped when i see the commercials for sonic, so one night after an adventure in the woodland corn maze, i dragged my friends to sonic just to check it out.  it was mediocre at best, and while i still defend its awesomeness to the fullest, even ill admit that the food isnt as amazing as it looks.  the slushees however were pretty good, so if it has to be a destination for something, take them up on that. Users/IanRamsay

20060408 12:00:19 nbsp So yesterday I wanted a drink... and tada, to my surprise there was Sonic... Ive had their yogurt drinks before (yech!), but this time I ordered a strawberry slushee and it was awesome.  Not only that, the guy at the drive thru said they had special happy hours from MF between some times (dun member what they are, but I went at 3) and my medium slushee only cost me 81 cents... sweet!  Way better than 711 slurpees, not too sweet, and I could taste the strawberry pieces. (and cheaper!)  YUM! ) Users/JuliaNiazov

20060502 23:28:02 nbsp Mmmm....Texas Toast. Users/LeightonHinkley

20060503 09:35:04 nbsp If you go and decide to eat in the dining area, please dont park in a drivein stall.  You just succeed in taking a space from someone who does want to eat in their car. Users/RogerClark

20060724 13:31:24 nbsp Yeah, food not so great, BUT decent dessert fare for the everynowandagain dessert eater. Not too long ago I discovered that for ten cents more theyll mix your milkshake flavors. I highly recommend mixing chocolate and peanut butter....yummy... Users/HelenDahlberg

20060725 10:05:48 nbsp So far, Ive only had Sonics desserts and theyre pretty darn good.  ...Coconut, banana and strawberry cream pie shakes count as part of the 5aday fruit serving, dont they? (peanut butter and chocolate sounds good) Users/DukeMcAdow

20060928 17:33:05 nbsp Ok, the drivethru is open 24 hours, the patio is open until midnight I think and they got a pretty broad menu selection. Also Im a DJ on Sonic Radio, suckas. Users/SteveBlais

20060929 12:43:06 nbsp I remember getting this food back east, so glad to have one out here now! Users/JoeRunnels

20070122 03:01:08 nbsp Sonics was out of control the first 3 weeks it was open. I always wanted to try it, I wasnt let down... Then again I wasnt blown away. Users/StevenDaubert

20070303 11:53:41 nbsp A decent place to get a burger.  Better than your standard fast food fare, but not as good as InNOut. Users/AlexPomeranz

20070304 15:51:55 nbsp I love the chicken toaster. Lots of bacon on Texas Toast with breaded chicken breast... and TOTS! Users/CarlosOverstreet

20070927 10:02:12 nbsp Burgers are good, not great.  But the frozen menu is awesome!  Sonics is a classic with my family, and we try to stop at one everytime we go on a road trip. Users/CaitlinMorrow

20080219 20:23:27 nbsp Sonic is worth the drive. Any of the toaster sandwiches are amazing, and the servers have always been really friendly to my roommate and I, despite our insane orders. Users/KateAusten

20090112 21:21:53 nbsp Okay food, but for me the Cherry Limeade is the best fast food drink around.  Users/DavidFeliz

20100608 05:33:51 nbsp Last Sunday at 3am I decided to drive to Woodland to get Sonic. The drive thru was closed...  Users/xgen
