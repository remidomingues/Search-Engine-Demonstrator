Sonic.net is a mom and pop ISP gone regional. The name is an abbreviation of Sonoma Interconnect. They started out providing cheap internet services to Santa Rosa Junior College students in the early 1990s and just blew up from there. In addition to selling internet access, theyre also a reseller of DirecTV satellite television and Verizon Wireless mobile phones cellular service. Bundles are available.

Their DSL offerings in Davis top out at 6 Mbps down and 768 kbps up. There is no PPPoE and their modems are easily configured to operate in bridge mode. The standard dynamic option provides you a single IPv4 IP address that is subject to change but rarely does. You can also get 8 static IP addresses for a bit more money. Their Fusion DSL service offers up to 30 Mbps down and 2 Mbps up through pairbonded annex M ADSL2+, a service now being offered in Davis through Nevada Citybased http://www.sacramentofusion.com Spiral Internet, and Shingle Springsbased https://cal.net/fusionpc/ Cal.net.

Beware of their DSL pricing: The rates on their website are promotional and will go away eventually. It used to be that you had to sign a contract for a year to get those rates, but this is no longer the case. Supposedly you can call up customer service before your rates go up and get the promotional rates extended indefinitely, but wl I havent done this yet.

If youre interested in IPv6, they offer IPv6 tunnels to customers, which is much faster than using a third party.

They are a webhosting provider, selling both shared hosting on a cluster and server colocation. DavisWiki and Wiki Spot were collocated in Sonics Santa Rosa data center for awhile.


20120413 17:27:54 nbsp I switched over to them from Comcast about 2 months ago, and have been pretty happy with their internet service so far. In particular, customer service has been very responsive  their IT guy, Bax, has stayed around after hours to help troubleshoot my connection. Definitely a different experience than dealing with either Comcast or AT&T help.

The internet speed is pretty reasonable, but definitely not close to the 20Mbps potential advertised on the web site. Usually its fine for streaming videos and such, but every once in a while it gets choppy  though its much more reliable than the previous Comcast connection. Im about 7700 feet from the DSL substation (according to their maps), so others that live closer would likely have speedier service. Users/TrayBiasiolli

20120708 07:43:26 nbsp For clarity, Spiral Internet does sell Fusion: Internet+Phone in Davis  http://www.fusiondavis.com . Tray Biasiollis customer service comment is about Spiral, not Sonic.net. Fusion is a nextlevel DSL Internet product offering speeds of up to 20Mbps (depending on how far you are located from the telephone Central Office) with unlimited Internet access and unlimited telephone service.
