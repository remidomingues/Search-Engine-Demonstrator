Sonya and Buddy are the beloved pets of Users/BobbyGray.  Sonya is a twelve year old female Rottweiler (Bobby has had her since he was six).  Buddy is just a pup: hes Border Collie mixed with Malamute and Queensland.  Both are the penultimate of friendly dogs and love to run and play.

UPDATE: Sonya finally passed away peacefully in her sleep April 2010.  She was almost sixteen years old, bright and cheery to the end.  Buddy has grown up to be a most handsome gentledog (immediately loved by everyone he meets) and lives with Bobby in Sacramento.  Commonly can be found frequenting various dog parks, but Davis dog park is still his favorite place to run, play, and meet other dogs and their owners.
