The sophomore walk is a nickname for Scripps Drive and the Anderson plaza  The term stems from the fact that the Davis High School sophomores lack a drivers license and have to walk or bike somewhere to obtain grubs if they dont want to have the on site food. DHS is an open campus at lunch time, although there is talk of bringing fast food vendors to the MPR area (the Multi Purpose Room with triangle windows visible from Oak Avenue) after it is renovated and making the campus closed.

Residents of Scripps have had problems with littering and fights and have motorcycle cops and more commonly the yard narcs (noon duty supervisors and campus safety officers) in the DHS golf cart to make sure the students dont act a fool on Scripps or in the Save Mart complex. Recently, however, there has been no supervision.

Dont try and visit the Save Mart complex during the lunch hour for DHS (11:30 to 1ish), unless you like lines out the door and a grip of unruly high school students

DaVinci High School students also have their own variation of the sophomore walk involving the Davis Manor Center adjacent the school, often causing similar problems, albeit to a lesser extent, along the Dollar Tree and Red Orchid

20070910 11:34:07 nbsp As a high school student, I found the cops to extremely excessive and obnoxious, zooming up to people on motorbikes at high speeds and threatening to ticket and even arrest them for walking in the gutter.  I feel they caused more problems than they solved.   Users/TobinJones

20080505 19:49:28 nbsp Ill miss living on the sophomore walk.  I actually liked scaring kids with my car as I drove to and from home.  But more so, I liked swerving around them like they are an obstacle course.  One time, some group of kids started dancing to the music I was playing when I had my windows down...

20100413 01:34:20 nbsp I used to work for the BaskinRobbins thats in Anderson Plaza, and believe me, we used to dread lunchtime. Now, I know not all students are bad, having been one myself, but the ones who are spoil it for everyone else. We would have trouble with vandalism, people stealing ice cream out of the freezer, and the fact that everyone wanted the timeconsuming blended cappachino blasts or smoothies, and started getting unruly if there was more than a thirty second wait. That sort of thing is why there is an excessive police and administrative presence at lunchtime. The final straw was when they actually SET FIRE to one of our plastic tables outside. Yeah, just.. no.

Personally? I always brownbagged it when I was a student. Thats what lockers are for, plus its easier to eat healthy. Users/Flynn
