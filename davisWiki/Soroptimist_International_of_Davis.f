Soroptimist International is the worlds largest womens service organization committed to improving the lives of women and children throughout the world. We are a global voice for women.

SI Davis supports local nonprofits through at least two major fundraisers each year. We operate the beer booth on Wednesday evenings at the Davis Farmers Market. This money funds our grant awards program. We generally fund approximately $10,000 annually in grants to community organizations who help improve the status of women and girls. Our other fundraiser, an annual Texas Hold em poker tournament is held at the Davis Vets Memorial the first weekend of March and generates in excess of $15,000 for service grants to nonprofit groups in Davis.

The 2011 major fundraiser, “Texas Hold ‘Em and More: Spirit of the West,” will be held Saturday, March 5 at the Veterans Memorial Center, 203 E. 14th St. Tickets for the Texas Hold Em tournament, which is run by professional dealers, are $60 and seats are limited. Top prizes are Visa gift cards worth $500, $250 and $100.

General admission tickets are $40. Both tickets allow guests to enjoy nontournament poker, Black Jack 22 and Bingo as well as finger foods and a nohost bar. Prizes include gift baskets, gift certificates, wine and more.
