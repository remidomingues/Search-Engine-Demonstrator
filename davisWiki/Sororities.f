There are a number of sororities that are in fact womens Fraternity fraternities. These were founded before the term sorority was coined. Because of this historical reason some sororities are chartered as fraternities.  For example, Delta Delta Delta, Alpha Phi, Chi Omega and Alpha Delta Chi are technically fraternities. The word sorority was specifically coined for Gamma Phi Beta by Dr. Frank Smalley in 1882 and has been used ever since.
