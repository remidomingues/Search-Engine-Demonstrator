Sorority Life was a reality TV series by MTV that documented Sigma Alpha Epsilon Pi Sigma Alpha Epsilon Pis Spring 2002 pledge class.  The show was one of many instances of Davis in the Media in general.

The real sorority house was deemed too ugly to appear on TV, so MTV bought them a new house and remodeled it inside and out. The new house was outfitted with brand new furniture, stylish interior decor, bright television lighting, and dramatic exterior lighting just for the TV show. MTV then went to various bars around town and recruited attractive young women to pledge the sorority just for the show.

You would often see the sorority members walking around campus with a camera crew following them around. The camera person was usually a young college age female.

The series at UC Davis was the first of three Sorority Life seasons.
