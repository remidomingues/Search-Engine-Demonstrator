Sorrento Apartments is just across the street from Safeway, Rite Aid, and Office Max. It is the second apartment complex after Oakshade Commons Apartments Oakshade on the left of Valdora St., and is accessible via the W bus line W and M bus line M bus line. While it is not as posh as the surrounding apartments such as Avalon Apartments Avalon and Tanglewood, it offers a comfortable place for both students and families. There is a nice mixture of children in the day and drunk drunken students in the night during weekends. Current management is thought to be better than preOctober 2010.

They offer five floor plans in single and two story models. Features include a pool, spa and exercise room.

Sorrento Apartments also manages Brisa Villas and Avalon Apartments in South Davis.

  /Pre 2009  Reviews before 2009 Property Management Company change

20090123 21:28:33 nbsp I have been living in Sorrento for the past year and it has been fairly nice. The park, maintenance, size of the apartments, and general location are all ideal. However; the price that was initially advertised was not the price that I was given. Also, the management will constantly put letters in your mail if they have a complaint, which made me wonder why Im paying money to someone who cant even speak to me like a human being. Theres plenty of amenities to take advantage of, but the area constantly smells like kim chi, which is probably the most foul scent I have ever had the misfortune of smelling in my life. This smell comes from the 95% Asian population within Sorrento, so if you are looking to live in a diverse, social, attractive area then Sorrento is not for you. It certainly wasnt right for me.

20090221 11:56:05 nbsp I have enjoyed my stay at Sorrento.  I moved in at the beginning of sept 08.  There were some problems when we moved in.  Rat droppings, plugs not working, windows not opening, window screens falling off, etc.  HOWEVER, maintenance was amazing and fixed everything within the week, if not the next day.  If we ever had a problem involving needing maintenance, they have came and fixed it by the end of the day.  Both of the maintenance guys are friendly and nice. We are yet to see a rat.  The light in the oven was out, and they simply just replace the stove completely.  I havent ever really talked to Linda, but when I see her around the complex she always smiles.  The staff is always extremely helpful.  When any of my roommates and I walk into the office, Bryan or Ryan Im still not sure :/, always knows which apartment I belong to and usually can figure out why I am in there right away.  The outgoing mail has been broken into a few times, which would have been nice if we were notified about it.  However, when asked about mail not being received they admitted and told us they cant actually do anything with the mail boxes because it is US postal service property.  The park is right behind the complex, great for just a walk or relaxing.  The floorplans are well thought out, despite what some previous comments said.  I rarely smell anything bad.  Landscaping does come once a week and starts somewhat early if you like to sleep in during the week.  The landscapers do stare at all of the girls walk by.  I have even seen them stop what they are doing, and be quiet, just staring.  My roommates and I have just learned to ignore them completely though.  Parking is amazing.  I have never found any problem parking.  There are often guests who park inside, and there is still always parking.  The appliances you see in the pictures of the model are the EXACT same appliances you get, so there are no surprises.  Overall, this is great place to live.  Unfortunately, none of us resigned the lease because ther only bad thing is the cost.   It is way too expensive. Users/CaitlinBallengee

20090523 23:49:27 nbsp I dont know what everyone is complaining about. Ive never had any of the problems mentioned here.
Staff is wonderful. Theyve always been nice and responsive. The management feel like residents, not like a business. They all recognized me when just from when I originally came by to look at the model and have always been good to talk to, even if nothings up. Maintenance was pretty much perfect. All our requests were handled either the day of or the next day, During our stay we got a new stove (I didnt even notice anything wrong with the first one, but new one was nice), and two new sinks after reporting minor leaks. They always fix up anything we ask for, even if its not something major that theyre supposed to be responsible for. Management also accepts packages, which was very convenient.

The floor plan is very well thought out. Its spacious, open and wellproportioned. The living room is a good size, but not so large that the bedrooms are small for the square footage. The kitchen is also very roomy, and the vaulted ceilings make everything seem bigger. The upstairs bathroom (I live in a 4bed/2bath) is split into a sink/vanity area, a shower room and a toilet room, which makes having three girls up stairs quite manageable.

Parking is amazing. I have never seen the lot full, and most the time its more than half empty. Theres no need for assigned parking and having guests over is never a hassle. Around half the parking is covered, also.

Its mostly quiet. Occasionally there will be parties, but theyre never out of hand, too late or on weeknights. Lately the gardeners have been out earlier, but assuming youre getting up before 10 for class its not a problem. The school children are sometimes loud and a bit shrill, but theyre mostly only loud in the afternoon, so unless youre constantly napping with  your windows open (like me) then its no big deal.

The location is excellent. Across the street, maybe 3 minutes walk, from the M and W, and the P and Q are both just a few minutes further. Its across the street from SafeWay, OfficeMax, House of Chang Chinese food, Common grounds coffee, davis creamery ice cream, rite aid, round table pizza pizza, walnut park a huge park with tennis courts, volleyball, playgrounds... Basically its great, even if South Davis seems far away. Its also only a short walk to the post office and DMV.

Rents not that bad. For the 4 bedroom 2 bath starting fall 2007 it was $2440, +$30 for an inunit washer/dryer. It seems like a big number, but when looking for somewhere else to live (My roommates broke into factions. Wanting to live alone is my only reason to leave here.) I found nowhere comparable in terms of size, amenities, and general quality even only a little above the price here, much less below it. Security deposit was $1000, which spread amongst roommates wasnt a problem. Given my past interactions with the staff I dont foresee issues with getting the deposit back, though Ill report back after Ive moved.

Also, the official policy is no pets though Ive seen cats around as well as a couple small dogs in units. Either no pets is just the official policy to give management the upper hand in case of problems or people are just keeping them secretly.

I know this is quite long, but given my extreme satisfaction living here, I wanted to balance out the negative comments, especially those against the staff. The ease of dealing with them alone makes it that much more comfortable. Theyve always made it feel like a home for me, not like a business where theyre just hanging around to get my rent. The length of this comment is proportional to how much I like Sorrento.

tl;dr AAA+++ would live here again, full recommendation. Users/omgstarkitty

20091118 12:43:10 nbsp Reporting back re: security deposit:
They waived the cleaning charges, probably because needing light cleaning is normal wear and tear, but they charged $750, 3/4 of the deposit to repaint the entire apartment. However, they waived part of that bill and only charged us 614/1000. Perhaps they waived the price of what a touch up would have been and only charged us for excessive costs. They also did a full repainting on one of our neighbors apartments. Both were occupied by us for only one year. They said they charged for it because after one year the apartment should only need touch ups. I washed most of the walls, but one roommate spackled most of her room, so maybe they had to repaint that. So the security deposit refund wasnt great, but overall I found living there to be pleasant.

The only other downside I forgot to mention was that the fan in the shower room wasnt strong enough and the laundry isnt wellvented. Anytime the dryer was running the second floor would be hot and humid and windows would get condensation on them. There was a bit of mold, in the shower room and also on some downstairs windows.

20091228 5:22:00 nbsp Moved in Fall 2009 and on lease till Summer 2010, but Im iffy about the management and place. Theyre usually polite, but sometimes they give the impression that my coming into the office (to pickup packages, report problems, etc.) is a bother. When something happens, they are very slow to admit that they are in the wrong. Case in point: My fiance was supposed to receive a package on Dec. 21st, and both USPS and Amazon reported it as delivered on that day. The office tells him they dont have it. Its most likely because of their lack of accurate records, because the package log is in disarray with info often omitted. The management called the post office to check, and its been delivered. They still suggest that my fiance might have somehow missed it (hes been checking the mail everyday and hes the only one doing so at our place). Or that the mailperson didnt drop it off. Thats not the only incident though. Theyve been unhelpful when we talked to them about our downstairs neighbors smoking 24/7 (we have asthmatics whose conditions are worsening because of the smoke). Theyve had issues recognizing that my fiance has signed the lease, and kept saying that he wasnt (someone didnt have all the records together). Things take more than a few days to get fixed, and like I said before, I dont always feel welcome going into the office for something.

Perhaps I have been spoiled by the great management at Tanglewood. They worked with us through many troubles and were sincerely friendly. Sorrento isnt bad, and as mentioned above, theyre generally polite, but combined with my experiences with the management, the nonexistent gym, and overall quality of the complex, I definitely will not be staying here after my obligatory year.

             I apologize that your experiences with our office have not been as pleasant as I would like. We pride ourselves in having an          open door policy and I hope that we can make you feel comfortable to come in to our office to share any of your concerns or comments.

            We accept parcels and packages in our office as a courtesy and convenience to our residents.  I believe that you have             received your misplaced package but admit that the delay was caused by our confusion with the lease.  It is now clear to          us that while your fiancés given name is on the lease, it is not the name he goes by and we will not assume that it will be the   name on future packages.

            Thank you for bringing your concerns to our attention so that we can improve.

20110415 21:33:24 nbsp been living here for my whole college life and i have no complaints whatsoever about my experience here. the workers of the apartment complex are super awesome and friendly. 0 complaints Users/pol

20110711 12:25:52 nbsp I miss this place. They have spacious rooms and maintenance was always on top of things.  Users/mechee

20110808 17:01:50 nbsp I lived here for a year, and now that Im moving out this month, it makes me realize how much Im going to miss this place. :( I snagged a 3BR apartment by luck because that unit wanted to switch to a 2BR or something, and Im so glad I got to live here. Its also pretty obvious what a nice place Sorrento is since all of the rooms fill up stupidly fast during leasing season.

I think my favorite thing about this apartment complex is the management. Baker, Brian, and all of the others are incredibly nice and helpful; they also have fresh cookies and coffee everyday in the main office in case you feeling like dropping by before class or something. :) They have an online rentpaying system so that you dont even have to write them checks if you dont want to, they are really organized and on top of mailing/packages (they also have an automatic email notification so you dont have to call the office yourself every day and check), and their maintenance is extremely fast in responding to work orders/requests/apartment issues (within one or two days). Everyone who works there is extremely flexible and understanding.

One time I went home for a weekend, came back Sunday night, and realized that I forgot my keys inside. I was outside of my apartment with a bunch of crap I brought back from home, and I just called the office and left a message, even though the office was closed. I think it serves as some sort of an emergency thing and someone must have been notified of a new message, because 5 minutes later, someone came by and let me in with a key. Our apartment unit also had some roaches during a super rainy, wet couple of weeks and still knowing that it wasnt really Sorrentos fault that the dampness attracts bugs and stuff, they set up an appointment for a spraying and pest control like, the week of. I also had problems with leases and stuff, and while its not really their business to help you get through that (if you sign, its your responsibility), they still offered support and helped me get through it.

As for the apartments, I know that our unit was very clean and pretty new looking, but I havent been in any of the others. Everything else, including the exercise room and pool, is nice, and the apartment is super close to Safeway, Rite Aid, Office Max, etc. and also to the bus stops. Whats not to love about Sorrento? :) The prices are reasonable, management is friendly and cooperative, and the location is perfect. I feel like even if rent was a little more expensive it would still be worth it to live here, simply because they make your experience of living here that much better.

20121106 13:12:52 nbsp I have been living in Sorrento for about three years. I really enjoy living here. The maintenance guys are great they fixed our washer/dryer and the bathtub. I live with five other girls our bathtub its always clog. The maintenance guys never complain. Last week the maintenance guys and Thomas the manager came door to door to just check see if any houses need to fix anything. They gave out icecream, too. It was so nice of them ) I love living here b/c the bus is convenient and there is a Safeway right across the street from us.  Users/AppleSun


20130901 18:05:31 nbsp I lived in Avalon for the past three years, and I only have great things to say about the amazing staff. They have never failed to respond to our problems on the day of our maintenance requests, and they even replaced our washer and refrigerator during those years. The staff has always been friendly, patient, and fun to talk to, both before and after the change in management. Only a few days ago, we moved across the street to their Sorrento properties. Although the staff was swamped with the demands of other residents, they helped us a ton by making sure that we would have plenty of time carry things over, clean our previous house, and not be homeless for any amount of time. They are simply awesome! Users/wildcard418

20130903 18:12:24 nbsp Life in these most beautiful apartment homes has been a pleasure.  Well designed, quality in every aspect of the word...carpeting, appliances, fireplace, fixtures.  Management addressees concerns almost immediately, known for maintaining the property as functionally and aesthetically as possible.  Quite and safe community, proximal /within walking distance to grocery store, restaurants, coffee houses, office supply store and bank.  Bus line M & W, as well as several Yolo buses stop near the complex on Cowell Blvd.  Youll like it here if you choose to become a resident.   Users/dyerike
