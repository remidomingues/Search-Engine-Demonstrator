This club is no longer at UC Davis, the 20102011 year was the last year of the South Asian Student Organization.

The UC Davis South Asian Student Organization (SASO) was formed as an act of solidarity amongst our South Asian brothers and sisters at UC Davis in 2003. SOUTH ASIA consists of Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Bhutan, Nepal, and the Maldives.

Although the majority of our members are South Asian, we welcome members of all nationalities! SASO is not an exclusive organization  everyone is invited and able to attend all of our events.

One of our main goals, aside from creating a network for South Asian American students, is to educate the UCD communityatlarge about our culture. UC Davis is fortunate to have a diverse and talented crowd of South Asian students, and SASO aims to bring us all together through cultural awareness, social events, and community service.

The most notable event put on every year from SASO is the SASO Culture Show which is put on at the Mondavi Center in May. The Culture Show has been running since the early 90s at UC Davis, before the time of SASO, when the club was ISA (the Indian Student Association).
