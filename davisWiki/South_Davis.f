South Davis is what people who may or may not live in Davis call the Navigating Davis neighborhood south of Interstate 80. The area has been growing rapidly, adding many businesses and new housing complexes recently.

South Davis houses a lot of indispensable Davis businesses as well as a disproportionately high number of fast food places, relative to the rest of Davis.

See Navigating Davis for other regions.
