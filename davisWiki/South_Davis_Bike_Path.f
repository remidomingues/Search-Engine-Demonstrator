The South Davis Bike Paths Bike Path connects Research Park Drive to the UC Davis Arboretum.




Wohoo now we can all see what the South Davis Bike path looks like.

A good path for full moon bike rides, as long as you have your lights.

20130324 23:01:29 nbsp It took almost nine years (since this page was created) for someone (me) to notice the major error in Davis geography on this page. Yes, Mace Blvd. is in South Davis, but its way at the far end, miles away from the location of this bike path! (Or at least from the location of the photo on the right which said it was on Mace.) I corrected it with Research Park Drive. Users/RussellReagan
