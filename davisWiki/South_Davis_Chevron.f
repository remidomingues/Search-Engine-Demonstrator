More commonly known as the Fast and Easy Chevron.  Gas Stations Gas here is cheaper than most other stations in town, though not the two Arcos.  They have a carwash for X$1X __$7.99__ with 8 gallons minimum purchase (add on $12 extra for added features) .

Hometown Chinese Food Hometown Chinese Restaurant used to be located inside this complex but moved downtown and the current chinese food place is called Gold Town Chinese Restaurant Gold Town.

Located between KFC, Del Taco, and Wendys.

There is another Fast and Easy Mart located at the intersection of 2nd Street 2nd and B Street B streets.

For anybody who has or knows somebody with an RV or Camper Van, this is the nicest blackwater dump site (i.e., sewage dump) in town.  It is clean and usually has a good flush hose (replaced as people run over it).

They have decent coffee (which means its downright good for a gas station), and their location right off of 80 makes this a good place for an early morning stop before a long trip  gas up and get some coffee.  By 7:00am, the Sacramento commuters are already streaming through here.

They now offer E85 ethanol and B5 biodiesel which is a mixture of 5% biodiesel and 95% petroleum diesel that can be used in stock diesel engines with no problem. The alternative fuels are not a Chevron product as it clearly says on the pump, it is a product of CHS. At the time of writing it is cheaper than standard diesel.

20080918 23:03:17 nbsp Hows the car wash here? And are they really decently priced on gas? In my experience, Chevrons are terrible! Users/RobertM525

20090115 15:14:48 nbsp The car wash here sucks. The spinning roll thingy didnt even reach the hood of my car. My car wasnt that dirty to being with but was still looking shitty after I used this car wash. As usual for these types of places the dryer deal at the end didnt stay on long enough to actually dry any part of the car. Users/TheRadish

20110206 11:26:25 nbsp Avoid this station whenever you see dozens of men in the lot and around the pumps with AUTO GLASS on their shirts.  Yesterday the pumps and parking lot were crawling with these auto glass salesmen, who approached everyone and used highpressure, inyourface sales tactics to get people to repair and replace windows, whether or not there was any sign of damage.  Despite numerous attempts to tell them we werent interested and to step away from the car, they wouldnt.  I stopped pumping gas after just a few seconds and went to a different station.

20131124 13:57:59 nbsp This Chevron is cheaper than the one on Anderson, Probably due to its proximity to the 80 Users/StevenDaubert
