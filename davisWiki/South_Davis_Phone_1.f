Phone Number: 5307928464, incoming calls allowed DomenicSantangelo

Location: Outside the Safeway (South) entrance closest to the Rite Aid Rite Aid (South), next to the soda machines.

Description: This phone is in a very hightraffic area, which is part of the reason I only snapped one picture of it before leaving under the suspicious glances of soccer moms. As I examined the phone, a man who might have been a street person or a phone company employee asked me, Do you work for Verizon?

No, I told him, and walked out of sight.

Batman (or someone claiming to be him) has been known to call this phone, asking for the whereabouts of The Joker.

Charge: 50 cents locally
