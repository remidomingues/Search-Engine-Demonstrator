South Davis Veterinary Center was established in 2003 by husband and wife Michael Yackey D.V.M. and Cara Bradley D.V.M., both UC Davis Vet Med Teaching Hospital Vet Med graduates and Davis residents.  Dr. Jenna Grimes joined the practice in August 2005 and after 7 great years as part of the SDVC family, moved to Florida where her husband is a veterinary professor in Gainesville. Dr. Cameron Collins joined the practice in 2012 bringing with him an excellent reputation as a caring and skilled clinician.  On October 29th, 2012 South Davis Veterinary Center moved across the parking lot to the space formerly occupied by Mountain Mikes Pizza.  Their goal is to offer the same personalized care in a more comfortable and relaxing environment.

20070417 20:20:52 nbsp We called this morning about our cat, and they were able to get him in right away. We saw Dr. Grimes, who was friendly and competent. Our cat, who is very leery of strangers, tolerated her very well. She called back with test results this evening, and gave additional advice on what we could do for our cats condition. Im pleased with the care.  Users/AnnaJones

20070506 18:20:37 nbsp They always take superb care of my cat.  Additionally, I am a student, and they itemize costs, and were willing to go step by step with me on expensive tests (as opposed to doing them all at once) in a situation where my cat was exhibiting symptoms for something that could be nothing or something terrible.  We eventually whittled it down to nothing, based on a careful balance between cost and time.  They were extremely helpful to both me and my cost constraints, while also being mindful of any health concerns for the cat.  Luckily the cat is fine, and happy.  But I was greatful for their assistance and understanding. Users/NatFin

20070626 21:18:18 nbsp Weve been taking our animals to Cara and Michael from the day they opened.  Nicest people/vets ever!!  Best care we could hope for, and even when weve had to euthanize (twice, very sad) they have been the best! Users/Davidlm

20070728 00:44:25 nbsp This is where I take my dog, and Ive always been happy with both their friendliness and their concern over his health. This last part is particularly appreciated as hes had a few mishaps and, his Mommy is just paranoid and so although they have joked about him being a frequent flyer, they dont brush me off or assume the issue isnt serious. Anyway, really nice people who give you plenty of information.  Users/RobinMarie

20070730 20:26:03 nbsp I took my dog there today, and got Dr. Grimes. I found the staff and vets to be quite friendly and knowledgeable. Dr. Grimes gave suggestions, but didnt pressure me into anything (especially something unnecessary); I got plenty of time to think things over. Unfortunately, it turns out my dog will need knee surgery. Ive been calling around for different estimates, and South Davis has had the lowest prices so far! And my dog loved everyone, even though she usually takes a while to warm up to strangers. Users/ErikadelosReyes

20070821 23:57:15 nbsp Drs Bradley, Yackey and Grimes are wonderful.  Our many pets have received outstanding care from them since they opened this practice.  They always check to see how the patient is doing afterward, and treat our pets as part of our family and theirs.  I would never go anywhere else! Users/PatLenzi

20070822 14:36:15 nbsp I cant say enough good things about these guys.  Dr. Grimes explained procedures and options clearly, so that you can make an informed choice, and answered all questions.  The office staff is friendly, and everyone there seems to genuinely like animals.  You leave feeling as though your pet has been well taken care of. Users/CovertProfessor

20071013 15:24:47 nbsp My cat ripped his nail off just before I was planning to take him in for an upper respiratory infection that was getting out of control. Poor guy. So, I walked in with an acute injury and a chronic irritation. Both needed to be addressed promptly and I had $100 to spend. I saw Dr. Bradley, who was absolutely wonderful about picking and choosing the correct combination of diagnostics and treatments. A stain to make sure he didnt have a corneal ulcer, some antibiotic ointment for his eyes, oral antibiotics for his poor little toe, and instructions to soak his foot in dilute betadine. Just what he needed at just the right price. She gave me a long list of every possible thing that we could do for him on that day, and then helped me mark off everything that could wait. All with absolutely no (apparent) judgment, and without making me feel like a bad pet owner. I showed up a few minutes early for my appointment, was seen right on time, and the doctor spent plenty of time in the room with us. I will gladly go back, and can strongly recommend Dr. Bradley. A followup call, with detailed questions about my kittys condition, was a very nice touch. Users/EvoDiva

20071106 19:56:22 nbsp we had an emergency with our new dog (bloody diarrhea, yek!) and this was the only vet hospital that was willing to see him on short notice on a saturday. They took great care of him, were very thorough, and he got over the diarrhea in 2 days (he had picked up some giardia from drinking in a local pond). I highly recommend this clinic.  Users/zach.ronneberg

20080116 17:30:23 nbsp I called to ask about the possibility of my cat having a problem (related to my boyfriend getting pinkeye), and they had an answer for me right away.  Theyre always friendly and a great source of advice.  Im continuously pleased with their care of me and my pet. Users/NatFin

20080415 22:59:32 nbsp I had just adopted my dog, Jack, from the Sacramento Animal Shelter and they included a coupon for a free postadoption checkup. We met with Jenna Grimes and she was wonderful. She was very attentive and seemed to be genuinely interested in my concerns. I was treated excellent here and I will undoubtably be returning to them for Jacks veterinary needs.  Users/BrandonMinow

20080422 07:36:16 nbsp Just went there for the first time to spay my new kitten.  Dr. Grimes was very nice and sweet to my cat even though my kitty can be a handful.  I loved the fact that they called me the day before my appointment as a reminder and called the day after the surgery to see how my cat was doing.  Spay was $380 (this is the upper limit price which includes an optional preop blood panel and an IV catheter during surgery).  It was totally worth the price for my cat to receive safe and personal attention in a caring facility.  Front desk help was also pleasant and capable. Users/Shannon.F

20080714 21:11:34 nbsp Dr. Grimes helped me out this moring with my dog.  She listen to what I had to say and offered a good treatment plan.  The staff even called my previous outoftown vet to get my dogs records. As a fist time owner/patient I am please with thier care thus far! Users/jwali

20080721 15:34:20 nbsp I just went here for the first time today due to a sneezing fit my cats been having. The staff took wonderful care of him (and me)! I met Dr. Jenna Grimes and she was awesome. She didnt pressure me to put my kitty on meds, and told me what serious symptoms to look out for. The nurse (woman who took me in originally) was super sweet, and everyone there made sure he was as comfortable as possible during the exam. The price wasnt as bad as I thought it would be. It was $51 for the exam. Ive seen cheaper, but for the service I got it was way worth it. 5 stars. Users/Revada9

20081113 12:46:30 nbsp I cant recommend this clinic highly enough. We had excellent experiences with both Drs Yackey and Grimes when our cat managed to get himself injured in fights. Both vets were extremely kind and knowledgable, our cat was comfortable with how he was handled by the vets and technicians, and treatment prices were very reasonable. When our cat sadly passed away recently the clinic staff were very compassionate and Dr Grimes sent us a lovely card. Well definitely return to them for the care of any future pets. Users/AG

20090214 21:06:03 nbsp Ive been taking my rescue dog to see Dr. Bradley and am very happy with the care my elderly dog has received from her. She really takes her time with the visit and you can tell she has the animals best interest in mind. I have never felt pressured to purchase any treatment or procedure. She suggests options, explains their benefits, and lets me choose what to do. Very happy with this office! Users/NotSure

20090325 17:09:16 nbsp The staff was very friendly and gentle with my cat. Dr. Grimes answered all my questions and went over all options and costs before doing anything. The best vet I have dealt with in Davis. Users/BrianTurner

20090413 18:32:22 nbsp This place is amazing! Users/Churro615

20090708 16:47:44 nbsp Dr Yackey is a blessing to animals and the people who love them.  You couldnt ask for more in a vet.  His clinic is also very warm and welcoming and his staff are happy and kind and reflect a level of teamwork one wishes were more common.  If you are looking for the best care for your pets you neednt look any further. Users/SeaBird

20090708 20:12:45 nbsp We had our (extremely loved, even, yes, Ill say babied) pugs dental and nasal work done here this week.  We felt like they treated him like their very own dog!  They called during the procedure to talk to us about how it was going (surgery can be extremely risky for pugs), and verify how much we were willing to spend (as much as we needed to, of course).  Everything turned out perfectly.  We could not be happier with the service we always receive from these guys, and Buddha is doing great! Users/Davidlm


20090713 19:58:48 nbsp When my dog developed a negative reaction to a distemper vaccination that she had received at another clinic, they took my call and the vet there (didnt get her name) walked me through what to do carefully, slowly, and patiently, even though I am not even a client there.  Usually, people (including me) freak out when their animals dont feel well, and ask a lot of questions that might not make any sense, but she showed no sign of impatience, and remained very friendly, professional, and comforting throughout a somewhat lengthy conversation.  It is very clear that she cares about animals.  She also mentioned signs to look for which might indicate a more serious condition that requires emergency care.  What more can you ask for in a vet?  My niece is planning to become a vet too, and I hope she becomes a fine and outstanding one like the vet at South Davis that took my call. Users/ChingChing

20090717 02:56:47 nbsp Excellent, excellent work. They really go out of their way to help you, and it is obvious that they love animals. I just adopted a stray dog, and they were able to get me set up with all the necessary basics for him. At the moment, I am between school and a job, so money is kind of tight, so they kindly explained the expenses and also gave me estimates in terms of what was necessary and what could wait. Theyve earned a repeat customer, and upon obtaining a job (in the next month or so) I will certainly be going back and sparing no expense on my puppy. Users/JoePomidor

20090928 18:38:41 nbsp This is the best vet I have ever been to!  I took my two dogs into get examinations and vaccinations.  Gus is very scared of new people and will bark at them, so I called ahead to make sure we wouldnt cause a problem in the waiting area.  The receptionist checked the schedule and said that there shouldnt be any other patients at that time but that if there were, we could move straight to an exam room.  When we got there, the vet tech was very gentle and reassuring while she took their vitals.  When Dr. Yackey came in, he pulled out a giant bag of treats and started earning the dogs trust.  He gave both of them very thorough examinations, and asked me many times if there were any concerns I had about their health.  Of his own accord, he mentioned that one of the vaccines Chico had been getting might not be necessary, and we were able to discuss the pros and cons of giving that vaccine.  I was worried that such a long and thorough exam would be expensive but the price was very reasonable, including a multidog discount.  I was also thrilled that they made no attempt to foist upon me a bunch of unnecessary products or procedures, something that is unfortunately common at other practices.  I recommend these guys unconditionally. Users/Meemsie

20100216 21:12:26 nbsp My cat came down very ill one morning and they were able to get me in the same day. The front staff as very nice and knowledgeable and I was very impressed with Dr. Grimes. She was patient, very smart and great with my cat. She spent a lot of time with me answering all of my (millions) of questions and helped break down the next steps we should take. I was really impressed with her and this clinic.  Users/cori82

20100326 11:21:30 nbsp I wont go back to this clinic again. While I was able to get an appointment right away, the vet I saw misdiagnosed my pet (and took an hour and a half to do so). I came in thinking my cat was constipated. The vet I saw at this clinic told me he had a bladder infection and was not constipated (this was after doing an ultrasound). They told me hed need to be monitored overnight, so they sent me to the vet hospital on campus. Im glad they did send me there, because the cat DID have an impacted colon and no bladder infection, which the UCD vet noticed after a very brief examination. It was a stroke of luck that this clinic wasnt able to keep pets overnight. Im afraid my cat would have died without the proper diagnosis by the UCD vet hospital.  Users/Bethel

20100406 21:46:37 nbsp BEST VETS AROUND!! They go the extra mile to make sure that your animals are well taken care of. I only want the very best for my pets, and this Veterinary Center gives 110%.

A++ Dr. Yackey is very considerate and is never inconvenienced by you or your pet, no matter how many questions you may have. Dr. Bradley is dedicated and will stop at nothing to be sure your pet is getting the best care possible. Dr. Grimes has a great positive attitude and is extremely knowledgable in Veterinary Medicine. These Veterinarians and their technicians work as a team, and together, make the perfect practice. I bring my animals to see them and will continue to do so for as long as they are in business!

20100602 12:38:46 nbsp In my five short years in Davis I have dealt with four different vets, and I think South Davis Vet Center is by far the best vet in Davis.  My dog has been seen by Dr. Grimes and Dr. Yackey and they are both fabulous.  Every time I bring my pup in they treat him like he is part of their family too.  They are very thorough and I never feel rushed when asking questions (I often have many!).  Being a starving student, money is tight, which south davis vet understands, and they are great at breaking every thing down for you into an itemized list and telling you your options.  Compared to other vets, everything is comparably priced, and I have never felt judged when I decline specific parts of procedures or products due to cost.  They are fabulous at scheduling appointments and procedures right away.  Every time my doggy has been in for surgeries they always call with updates on whats happening and how he is doing without me having to call them.  They call immediately with any test results and to check in on your animal, and are prompt with check up and vaccine reminders.  They just genuinely care about their patients and I recommend them to everyone I know. Users/lia.hope


20110121 10:44:31 nbsp We have been going to South Davis Vet for a few years and I cant say enough good things about them. All of the staff are so friendly and helpful. Our dog is like our baby, and we appreciate that they are very thorough and take the time to listen to our concerns and take time with each appointment. I dont feel like they are rushing us out. When we visit, my dog actually wants to go to the vet.  Users/MissKay

20110801 14:16:44 nbsp We have just changed vets after working with South Davis for the past four years or so. Our reason is they tend to be geared toward a surgical intervention for any ailment even when there is another option that could be less invasive and have the same possible outcome. Also, the waiting room is filled with bags and bags of Science Diet so the seating is uncomfortable and limited. The practice is just too busy now to not give you the sense that your animal is important. The two exam rooms are always way too hot and you spend a lot of time waiting in them AFTER youve waited in the waiting area. Over New Years eve day, we took my daughters dog in for stitches (her sister attacked her in a dominance thing on a walk) and before we got home one of the eight had come undone. A second one was on its way, so my soninlaw used tweezers and super glue to tie it back. I realize it was late on a busy evening, but the work was just shoddy. We personally like all the vets very much, they are very nice. It just feels like a factory now.  Users/laurietreacher

20110924nbsp Dr.  Bradley, at South Davis Veterinary Center, is excellent at dental work (extractions, cleanings, etc.) and even has specialized dental xray equipment for animals, something no other Davis vets had when I last checked.  I moved my boy kitty with stomatitis there to see Dr. Bradley, even though I live on the northwest corner of Davis and SDVC is on the southwest corner.  Kitty does not like the ride, but Dr. Bradleys expertise and caring is well worth the longer drive. Users/BarbaraKing

20120128 00:14:05 nbsp We started out with Animal Wellness Center and decided to switch for a few reasons. Our first visit to South Davis Veterinary Center was great. we saw Dr. Yackey, who was great. The woman who often answers the phone is so sweet and patient. Also, their prices were better than the other vet we went to. On our second visit, it was a different story. The long waiting others talked about is accurate. We also had a rude, impatient vet tech named Laurel, who seemed almost angry to have to deal with us. She didnt seem to like animals or people, which seems a bit odd. The vet on our second visit was Dr. Grimes. She was okayfairly friendly and nice to our dog, but she was a little bit pushy about things she thought we should buy for our dog. Ive heard similar stories about Laurel, and Ive heard some negative comments about Dr. Bradley, but overall, they seem to be better than the other vet offices in Davis.  Users/ClairLee

20120223 19:15:44 nbsp Dr. Grimes is a very intelligent, patient, and understanding vet. I recently saw her and had procedure done and was pleased with the accuracy of her quote, her willingness to talk about the procedure, and followup. Hopefully I wont have problems requiring her expertise in the future, but I know my pets are in good hands when I bring them to her and I would recommend her highly.  Users/CaroBaro

20120615 16:40:06 nbsp This is definitely the best experience Ive had with a vet.  I called and got an appointment the very next morning.  It was refreshing to not be pressured or guilttripped into any unnecessary procedures or expenses.  They also took extremely good care of my dog, actually listened to anything I had to say, and were patient with my dog being kind of a chicken about everything.  I think I paid about $250 for the physical exam, the sedation and the foxtail removal from his nose, and then they actually refunded me $30 since they didnt end up finding any foxtails.  Sedation alone is pretty expensive I know, and Im pretty sure the VMTH charges quite a bit more for this procedure, so overall I think theyre probably quite a bit more affordable than most other vets in Davis.  And they even called the next day just to check up on how my dog was doing, which Ive ever had a vet do before!

I liked them quite a bit more than the VMTH, who always seem to take a week before they can get me an appointment, seem much less personable and actually concerned about my dog, and always end up costing me quite a bit more than I was bargaining for.   Users/lacyluwho

20120831 20:21:26 nbsp I got a new puppy a few weeks ago and decided to go to this office because it was the most convenient to my apartment. My puppy had yeast infections in both ears and giardia. They gave advice and prescribed medication for both. It hasnt been cheap, but at least he is getting healthy. The doctors have been very patient answering all my questions. I would recommend this office to anyone.  Users/DustinBurns

20130128 19:27:53 nbsp I cant imagine a nicer group of people to trust your pets with. Our 7 year old pug Buddha died due to an accident over the weekend. We had been bringing him here since he was a puppy. They tried their best to help him, but when he died they felt as if their very own pet died. I dont think I could ever be happier with a veterinary hospital. Users/Davidlm

20130523 14:40:13 nbsp I cant say enough good things about this office. Ive been in for a few visits now and called a couple times with questions and have had great experiences every time. My cat had a scary allergic reaction to a vaccine given yesterday and they fit him in right away and took such great care of him. All three of the doctors here have been awesome and as long as Im in Davis, I wont ever go anywhere else. Users/KristinBrown

20131105 21:20:32 nbsp Came up from San Diego with our Saint Bernard, noticed him limping on the way.  Brought him in first thing next morning and luckily they took him in even though booked.  The vet and all the staff were so thorough, patient, and nice, makes me want to move here just to have this wonderful vet to take care of our saint.  They didnt didnt give him any unnecessary meds, even though made process of getting a good look take longer, provided other useful information, followed up with his records, and charged us half of what our vet back home would have.  Cant say enough good things about South Davis Veterinary Center! Users/SamFoster
