The South Entry Parking Structure is on Beau Vine Lane. It provides parking for events at Mondavi Center and is managed by Transportation And Parking Services TAPS.  It was completed in 2002. The structure is covered in the same type of sandstone tiles as the Mondavi Center.

It is the closest parking structure to the UC Davis exit off of Interstate 80 I80.
