The address(South Silo, 38.538205, 121.752796) is, rather predictably, a Campus Buildings campus building just to the south of the Silo.  South Silo has all sorts of fun things, and you can see many Hippies hippies frequenting the place due to the Experimental College and the Whole Earth Festival offices.

  the Silo Bookstore Silo branch of the UC Davis Bookstore serving the School of Law

  The Experimental College office
  The Whole Earth Festival office (in the same room as EC)
