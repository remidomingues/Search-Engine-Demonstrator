Southeast Asians Furthering Education (SAFE) is part of the Student Recruitment and Retention Center.

SAFE aims to empower Southeast Asian students to actively pursue higher education, retain Southeast Asian students currently enrolled in institutions of higher learning and engage parents in the educational process. Retention services provided include: study halls, academic workshops, old test database, retreats, and socials.

The services provided include: college workshops, campus visits, conferences, parent workshops, and resources.

Through recruitment, retention, resource and referral services, SAFE will empower students to successfully enter into and graduate from institutions of higher education.

SAFE is located at the Student Community Center in the Student Recruitment and Retention Center

For more information, email safe.staff@ucdavis.edu. We are always looking for staff members. You can volunteer to help us out and even receive transcript notation through the Internship and Career Center ICC or Asian American Studies ASA units.

Structure
SAFE is a studentrun student initiated organization made entirely by student coordinators and a team of interns and volunteers (VIP). SAFE composes one sixth of the Student Recruitment and Retention Center, which in itself is a department of Student Programs & Activities Center.

SAFE is loosely divided into three components: Resource, Retention, and Recruitment.

Resource

Retention
 Southeast Asian Leadership RetreatThe upcoming retreat is scheduled for 0406 November 2005. Shoot an email to blusafe@yahoo.com if youre interested in any aspect of the event! There have been two retreats in the past, so this upcoming one will be the third ever.

Recruitment
SAFE visits four high schools on a regular basis: Grant Union, Highlands, Florin, and Valley. We used to visit Luther Burbank, but since our point of contact has made vice principal and is too busy to support our activities, we no longer have the ability to maintain our presence. SAFE is present at one middle school, Samuel Jackman.

 Weekly Visits  During the 20042005 school year, SAFE made weekly visits every Friday to all schools with regular visits to Burbank in the Fall. At these visits, we stress the importance of higher education by presenting workshops on academic and cultural topics such as Lunar New Year, food, time management, FAFSA, college applications, and study habits. These visits are great for recruitment because they allow a oneonone interaction between college students and high school and middle school students.

 Field Trips  SAFE occasionally gathers a group of students and takes them on a university visit. This year we went to San Jose State. We also took a group to Asian Pacific Culture Week Asian Pacific Culture Night.

 Middle School/High School Conference   In May 2005, SAFE held a conference on the UC Davis campus open to all the students we had outreached to through out the year.  There was a guestspeaker, workshops, a scavenger hunt, a talent show, and much more.

Communities Served
Image(vietnam.jpg, Our targeted communities trace their national origins to Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam., 150, left, thumbnail)Although SAFE targets certain primary communities, we do not refuse anyone who seeks us out wishing to enlist our services. These primary communities are those ravaged by the Vietnam War, groups from Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. These include Vietnamese, Lao, Cambodian, Chinese, Hmong, and IuMienh.
BRBRWhy do these communities deserve special attention? Imagine yourself as a farmer in Davis. All your life youve been farming and all your skill sets relate to farming and animals. Out of nowhere, the old Southern Confederate states suddenly declare secession again! But this time is different, they have no defined boundaries, and wars leadership are Southern peasants who wish to overthrow the government. A war breaks out and drags on for a few, terrible decades. Although the secessionists dont crush the conventional military, they succeed in frustrating American morale and inflict crushing losses. In a gutsy move, the U.S. arms its rural citizens to fight a guerrilla war. Now, knowing nothing about war and tactics, you overcome overwhelming odds by rescuing thousands of regular troops and crush superior forces in your battles. However, looking at the reality of the situation, people are dying everywhere, and you see no real reason why all of this is happenning. After nearly a generation of fighting, the Washington eventually falls apart under its own weight. As chaos rips the land, you decide that to escape the new regime (in some areas theyve already cleansed so many people that the regular war looks pleasant), you have to escape the country. You grab your closest family and friends and prepare to flee. But before you do, you must evade vicious patrols that shoot on sight, the wilderness of the countryside, and the ubiquitous starvation. After the exodus, you join millions of other refugees in crammed sardine style ships in sailing to distant places youve never heard of. Youre forced to assimilate into a radically different culture, learn a new language, find some means of support, and ultimately raise children. This is just a sample of what the first wave Southeast Asian refugees faced in the U.S.FootNote(This scenario is made of bits and pieces of the refugee experience. For example, not everyone fought in the war, but a large majority of the lower classes did. The cleansing occured in all three nations, but was most pronounced in Cambodia during the Khmer Rouge, where in the span of a few short years, one third of the population had been killed.) If such an occurence were to happen stateside, wed probably at least have the fortune of traveling an open countryside instead of navigating thick jungles and the deadly Mekong River. Better yet, many countries speak English and most have an educated population exposed to some American culture. Of course, I know the scenario sounds ridiculous, such as the notion that the American government can implode, and then the following regime openly torturing its citizens, but this is what happened in Southeast Asia.

Coordinators
Every SRRC component organizes its coordinators in a different manner, but every group has an administrative coordinator, a Retention and Recruitment Organizing Committee Representative (RROC) (the RROC also functions as a Student Director), and a number of different retention and recruitment coordinators. Some groups have specific duties for coordinators, such as ACEs and Yikal Kuyums retreat coordinators.

For the 20052006 school year, SAFE staffs a RROC Rep, administrative coordinator, two retention coordinators, two high school outreach coordinators, and one middle school outreach coordinator. ALthough specific duties and areas are laid out, the coordinators function as a team and work collaboratively with each other and their interns to accomplish SAFEs goals.

History
Founded in 1999 by Kao Vang and the other RROC Reps: Laura Akers, Isis Castro, Jehan Clark, Christina Escobar, Yvonne Marsh, Javier A. Tarango, and Michelle Villaluz. Kao Vang was SAFEs RROC Rep. Prior to the SRRC, no component of the SRRC had functioned individually except for Bridge

Much of the SRRCs culture and administrative structure finds roots in UCLAs Student Retention Center. The UCLA SRC makes use of mother organizations, established student groups that provide support for the fledgling campus department. Many people both oppose and uphold this model of structural support. SAFE is supported by the Hmong Student Union, currently one of the largest and strongest Asian Pacific Islander student UCD clubs. Kao Vang was a member of HSU, and with her initial support, SAFE became predominantly staffed with HSU members. Although that trend continues today, SAFE is beginning to reflect more of the Southeast Asian community. Our goals has always been to further the educational needs of all Southeast Asians.

To the outsider, SAFEs most visible reflection of change can be seen in the coordinator titles that we hold. In the past there have been rigid titles that attempted to clearly define a persons role in managing strategic goals. Its not clear how strongly past coordinators adhered to those titles, but titles are beginning to matter less and less in the SRRC. We commonly refer to each other as being resource, retention, or recruitment instead of our formal titles. You can also notice how different areas fade and fold into others, especially the transfer student and peer mentorship positions. Recently, SAFE has decided that these are auxilary to the programs of other campus organizations. For example, clubs on campus have better and stronger peer mentorship programs than SAFE, owing strongly to the fact that those clubs are easier to identify with than SAFE. Since there are so few Southeast Asian transfers on campus, SAFE has decided to scrap a formal component and serve that population on a casebycase basis.

Diane Yang is currently the youngest RROC member, in terms of both age (DOB 07 November 1986) and school year (sophomore). Correct me if Im wrong, but shes also the youngest RROC ever to sit on the committee.
