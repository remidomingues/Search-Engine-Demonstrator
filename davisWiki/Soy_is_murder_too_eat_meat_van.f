This Unique Vehicles unusual van, apparently based in Davis, promotes the consumption of meat, instead of soy products. The caption on the artwork reads:

 SOY is MURDER TOO EAT MEAT.

Soy representatives were not available for comment. The object on top of the van appears to be a mattress.






I saw this van a couple days ago, its awesome Daubert
