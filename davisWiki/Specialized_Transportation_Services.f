The UC Davis Specialized Transportation Services (STS) runs Tipsy Taxi, and charters Unitrans buses to groups interested in using the buses for events outside of regular service.

STS is not the same as Unitrans, it is a separatelyfunded unit of ASUCD.  However, buses, some vans, and Unitrans personnel are utilized.  STS has two 15passenger vans and two 20passenger cutaways of its own (hence why Unitrans is not plastered all over them).

Tipsy Taxi was originally a separate unit (separately funded as well) from STS, but in Spring of 2006, the ASUCD Senate voted to combine the two units into one.


 Tipsy Taxi 

Tipsy Taxi runs Thursday  Saturday from 10 PM  2 AM for $3/ride. Call (530) 7526666 to request a ride.

New Tipsy Taxi passes are now available. They are available in the Unitrans business office in South Hall Room 5 for $2 each. Each pass can be used only once; passes are collected upon the passengers entrance on to the vehicle. Cash, personal checks, and money orders only (made out to Specialized Transportation Services). Credit and debit cards are currently not accepted.

 Chartering Buses/Vans 

Persons interested in chartering buses can go to the basement of South Hall Room 5 (on the UC Davis campus) or call (530) 7529835. If no one is available, please leave a voice message with your name and phone number and you will be contacted as soon as someone is available at the office. You must call at least 2 weeks in advance in order to book a charter. No singledeck or doubledeck bus can be chartered on a regular school day before 6:30PM because all buses are in use for regular Unitrans service. STS does not charter buses 45 miles past Davis and doubledesks may not leave the city of Davis.  If there are charters already set for a certain date, pending charters may be denied.

Charters are charged by the number of buses/Vans used, the total time in use (twohour minimum). and miles traveled.
Effective July 1 2012, rates are (per bus):

Single Deck/1220 Passenger Vans (for ASUCD affiliated groups): $70.00/hour, $1.25/mile
Single Deck/1220 Passenger Vans (regular): $77.00/hour, $1.25/mile
Double Deck (ASUCD affiliated): $90.00/hour, $1.75/mile
Double Deck (regular): $99.00/hour, $1.75/mile

Thirty minutes will be added before the pick up time and after the drop off time to allow the driver(s) to perform a standard, required bus inspection for safety.  Traveling time and mileage from the garage to the pickup location, and from the dropoff location to the garage, will also be factoredin. Each singledeck may seat 40 passengers; all passengers must have a seat on the bus. A $200 deposit is required for all sororities and fraternities but will be returned if no incidents occur.

For more information, feel free to email or call the STS office.
