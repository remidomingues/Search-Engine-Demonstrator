 Reuben Sandwiches 

A wiki:WikiPedia:Reuben_Sandwich Reuben Sandwich is a tasty grilled Sandwiches sandwich that is more commonly found on the east coast. The traditional Reuben is made with rye Breads bread, corned beef, sauerkraut, Swiss cheese and Russian dressing, a dressing similar to Thousand Island, but thinner and without the pickles. Its inclusion on a menu is an instant indication that the restaurant is not Judaism Kosher Kosher law prohibits the simultaneous eating of dairy and meat.

Finding a Reuben in Davis can be a difficult task, but certain places carry them. You can also find Rachels, which substitute pastrami for corned beef, and Thousand Island for Russian dressing. Rachels sometimes have coleslaw instead of sauerkraut, but no place serves them that way in Davis.

20051221 11:30:38 nbsp My comment went away when the page changed. :( I love Reubens. Im a big follower of them. Whenever I travel, I always ask for a Reuben at some restaurant Ill go to. I actually thought they originally came from Germany. I didnt know there was such an availability of them in Davis. Ive been eating them at Bakers Square until just recently. Now, I do like Noahs better (I just realized that part of my comment was integrated) and I cant wait to try them at the other Davis locations! I have to admit, I am a bit surprised the Nugget has them ... I dont remember seeing them on the menu last I went. SS
