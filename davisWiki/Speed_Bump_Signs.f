  They are speed bumps on the East Coast.  I was amused as well for at least the first year of seeing the signs. jw

  Ohhh... I want to see an Undulations sign. Where abouts? Users/BrandonBarrette

    Off of Watt, south of I80, turn at the ballpark on Auburn, just past the Discovery Museum.  Drive through the back of the park loop that is Park Road and youll see some.  That parks bridle path is also a great place for a strip of nature walk in the middle of Sacto.  You can also walk down and sit by the creek. http://maps.google.com/?ieUTF8&ll38.641981,121.377683&spn0.014548,0.015578&z16 map.  The east side was (and may still be) a popular place for drug deals and random male sex, but fairly low key (I never had any issues, but figured I should toss that in for anybody who might). jw
