Speed traps are places the Davis Police/Highway Patrol set up multiple car/motorcycle officers to increase revenue for the city/state. Most motorcycle cops and some highway patrol officers can be seen with Lidar whereas cruisers more frequently use radar and pace vehicles.

MACE BOULEVARD CURVE/EAST COVELL
Heavily enforced. A Davis PD cruiser cop will camp out behind the bushes and nab speeders coming around the curve. Its usually desolate so its easy to lose track of your speed and them to pounce on you. Be extra careful during school hours when the speed limit jumps from 4025.

ANDERSON ROAD
Usually weekdays during school hours. A Davis PD motorcycle cop will tuck between two cars on the opposite side of the elementary school while school is in session. Be careful racing to beat the yellow lights, violating the loading zone policies, and pulling out in front of bicyclists. Speeding usually isnt an issue since theres so much traffic but bet hes watching.

ANDERSON ROAD (2)
Rarely enforced. Ocassionaly the same motorcycle cop who was nabbing alleged violators during school hours will move towards West Covell across the street from the Save Mart during random off commute hours. He usually isnt hiding and has his lidar unit pointed straight at traffic. Be aware lidar is relatively accurate for long distances so hell probably clock you before you even see him... which is probably why he isnt hiding.

RUSSELL BOULEVARD
Mostly at the way hours of night on the weekends. Usually just rolling around by the fraternities looking for drunk drivers and disorderly conduct. When the pedestrian signal lights up, make sure you stop.

INTERSTATE 80 BUSINESS EAST
Often enough. A CHP cruiser is usually camping out behind the underpasses right after the causeway. DO NOT BE FOOLED IF THEY ARE FACING THE SAME WAY AS TRAFFIC. They know most people tend to gun it when the 3 lane traffic on the overpass opens up going to Reno or downtown Sac. Best to stay in the right lanes and set the cruise control to 70 until you get beyond all of the overpasses.

INTERSTATE 80 WEST
Mostly weekends. If youre ever venturing to San Francisco, Fairfield, Vacaville, etc be aware of the CHP motorcycle officers camping out just past Dixon.


General notes on the CHP  watch out for them merging onto the freeways behind you. This is where most people usually fall victim to pacing. Hell get in a far off lane some determined distance behind you and follow you while he looks at his speedometer. Easy money since you probably never saw him get on the freeway. Something to be aware of.

Speed Safe

INTERSTATE 80 EAST
Random but often. Dropping down the east side of the Sacramento River bridge, its easy to pick up 510 mph and theres often a cruiser waiting to take advantage of that.  The fact that the CHP academy is only a couple miles way doesnt help.  Also be aware that theres usually a heavy enforcement action every weekend further up 80 just past Madison Ave extending to the CHP weight station involving radar and multiple cruisers.
