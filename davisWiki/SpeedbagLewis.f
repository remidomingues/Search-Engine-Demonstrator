Name: This is Speedball Lewis

where do i spend my time? Where else can thugs accumulate in large  numbers and thug it all day long? Where else are the laws of nature defied. A place where dogs dont chase the cat,  but rather converse and unite under one god, one light, one love.  No place other than the Thug Bungalow. A magical place (not for children under the age of 18). A place of wonder, mischief and comedy.  All provided by its local residents, Users/TimJarratt, Users/PatrickVisperas, Users/ZacMorris, and Christian EightBall Alvarez. such a nice place, do visit and tell them your boy lewis sent you.
