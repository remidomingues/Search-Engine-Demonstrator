20090429 15:29:42 nbsp Great place for an oil change, in my experience.  Price is good with a coupon, and although my last change took a bit, Im very comfortable going there and the manager Theresa is SUPER cool and helpful.  My car has never had an issue after an oil change here, and I definitely recommend the place. Users/ClarkVineyard

20090605 19:14:58 nbsp I had a good experience hereI forgot my coupon and they still gave me the discount. I would have liked it if they had warned me how much extra it would cost to have synthetic oil than regular...I got a bit of sticker shock when I got the bill. Waiting room was pleasant and had a shaded outdoor area for the kids to play. They also cleaned the interior of my car. I will go back. They give you a $5 discount if you bring the car in within 500 miles of the recommended oil change mileage. Users/Virginia

20090611 11:46:00 nbsp Went in for an oil change and was in and out pretty fast despite there being a line (okay, maybe 45 minutes, but I was expecting an hour or more with the wait). Dont have any complaints about the service the guy was very friendly and prompt and didnt try to sell me a new air filter on a car with <5000 miles. Users/AbbYu

20090617 15:12:48 nbsp THANKS FOR THE GREAT COMMENTS! We are working hard to keep all of your cars working efficiently in this economy and relish the opportunity to be your service center! Teresa  Owner, SpeeDee Oil Change & Tuneup Users/speedeetee

20090622 21:35:46 nbsp I must say that until this time I have had nothing but good experiences with them.  I had my oil changed there and shortly thereafter noticed that it was leaking around the drain plug so I brought it in figuring that they either seated it wrong or it needed a new washer and they did not tell me about it, and expected that they would fix it.  I was also thinking of having them put in a new timing belt and I figured this would let me know if i was going to let them touch that or not. I went there and they told me some bogus story about someone tampering with the drain plug and they wanted to charge me to fix it and the man was rather rude to me about it as well.  I wont be going there again. Users/ucdskiier

20090624 12:23:28 nbsp My boyfriend went here about 6 months ago for a simple oil change and single headlight replacement. He sadly didnt get an estimate before it and was shocked to be charged nearly $200 for half an hour of work. He knows better now, but we still feel sorta jipped.  Users/BrookeB

20090626 12:24:02 nbsp ucdskiier and BrookeB Im sorry if you had bad experiences recently...I dont know the exact circumstances, but if you are willing to come and talk with me about them I would be glad to see if I could rectify both situations. Thanks, Teresa  Owner Users/speedeetee

20090715 15:37:50 nbsp HEY ITS TERESA....its that time of year again...STUFF THE BUS...donate a new school supply and receive $10 off your service! We are partnering with CW 31 and KOVR 13 again this year and would love to see you all in contributing to this very worthwhile cause.

You all contributed soooo much last year and this years need is even greater, so come on, bring down a backpack, box of pencils, anything you can afford and help us help the kids!!!  SEE YOU ALL SOON! Users/speedeetee

20090724 13:17:10 nbsp I just had my car smogged & the oil changed. I presented my little green coupon machine coupon before service, and the guy gave me an estimate of 64.94 but was charged $79.99 ($20 more!!), and the office manager just shrugged off the original estimate as a mistake. WTF??  That is BAD business. I have been going there for 6 years and will never go back. When I asked about the brake inspection that was included on the coupon, the same lady said (in a not so nice tone) that if I wanted to get my brakes inspected I would have to leave my car there all day because I didnt tell them that I wanted the brake inspection. The coupon says present this coupon for a free brake inspection. I DID present it before service, but got no brake inspection.

DO NOT GO HERE. I am uber pissed.

If you are the owner & want to make it right, you can find me by my invoice number. 000018 on July 24, 2009 around 1pm (though the receipt says 12pm. Your clock is off I just got back). I have a chevy prizm.

The mechanics are nice. They should work elsewhere. Users/JessicaRabbit

20090812 20:33:52 nbsp Id like to share my experience at Speedee Oil Change. I had a check engine light that had been on for a couple of hundred miles (irresponsible, I know) and I wanted to finally take care of it. I pulled up at about 2pm on Tuesday and asked them to find the source of my check engine light. Much to my dissapointment, one of the employees told me it would be $90.00 just to run a diagnostic test. I asked, wow, is that the cheapest in town? to which he replied, thats the cheapest youre going to find it town. Hesitantly and begrudgingly I agreed to the astronomical price of $90.00 for a simple diagnostic (look at Georges Auto Repair; they charge $3545 for an estimate. Redfield Machine will do a complete diagnostic from the exhaust system to the door handles for a little more than $100. Unfortunately, I learned of these prices too late).

The guy then asked if I could leave the car there for two hours. I told him I didnt have a ride home and he said one would be arranged by the owner. What a great service to provide to customers. This was the one feature I honestly appreciated. I left the car there and one of the employees gave my brother and me a ride home. I sat around at home for two hours and nothing. No call. At 5:30pm, the owner Teresa called me and asked if the car could stay over night and again, begrudgingly, I agreed. She  told me that the mechanic would look at the car first thing in the morning.

I expected a call by 9:00 or 9:30am since they open at 8am on Wednesday. I finally called them at 11:00am and the guy answering the phone said they were still working on my car and  he was going to go get some information. After 7 minutes of being on hold, he came back on the line and told me that the mechanic would call me back with some information in 30 minutes. I received a call an hour and 15 minutes later.

They did find what the problem was. They told me they would have to order a part and it would be about $185 outthedoor. I did not give them authorization to order the part and called around. I took my cat to Triple A Automotive and they did if for $45 cheaper and it took them 30 minutes to do.

In conclusion, Speedee, please be more realistic and accurate in your time estimates that you give to customers. Also, please be more timely in addressing your customers (Im referring to your last minute call for the overnight) and, of course, youre prices are steep. Prospective customers, their prices and can be matched and beaten with a few phone calls. Users/ZElliott

20090817 11:43:34 nbsp ZElliott  I apologize for the long time frame that it took for your vehicle.  I am looking into why it took so long. The technician involved with the transaction of your vehicle will be informed of your comment and I am working on making sure that this doesnt happen in the future.  Please let me have the chance to correct this, and thank you for bringing this to my attention.  Teresa Users/speedeetee

20091006 11:42:00 nbsp I just wanted to let everyone know that we have had a change in management...after careful consideration Randy and I have decided to take back the management of the shop ourselves. Your comments have helped us realize that we were not doing our best, I apologize for any mistreatment any of our customers have received in recent months.  Please give us another try...let us know what your experiences were and let us make it right. We are here for YOU, and if it werent for YOU we would not be here.  Mention Davis Wiki and well discount your service!  Hope to see you soon!  Teresa Users/speedeetee

20091103 18:27:04 nbsp So Today I just went here for an oil change and finally got a chance to see my receipt. I just realized i got charged 10 dollars for premium oil filters Surprise charge? I believed  it said 36.99 not 36.99+ hidden charges. Anyways Im definately not going here again. I should of just went to Hanless toyota. it only charge 25 dollars plus 27 inspection points for FREE.  Users/itskim

20091104 16:36:41 nbsp I went there for a routine oil change and they told me that the brake fluid looks contaminated and should be changed for safety. Note that the guy told this by just looking to the small oil tank!!! Furthermore, I had the brake fluid flushed 34 months ago in the same place. What a scam!!! I will not go there anymore.  Users/Stan34
                 20091105 12:05:23 nbsp Hey its Teresa, owner of SpeeDee....I just wanted to address the comments by itskim and Stan34...first, our oil changes start at $36.99 for conventional oil....some vehicles require oil filter that cost me more, and in turn the cost is passed on to the customer, some vehicles require more than the maximum of 5 quarts of oil included in the oil change package, again that cost is passed on to the customer.  Stan34, Im not sure which employee told you your brake fluid looked dirty, but I have my employees check brake fluid copper content with a dipstick that is inserted into the brake fluid canister and tests for the copper parts per million in the brake fluid. We recommend brake fluid flushes in that way...like I said Im not sure which employee told you that, but I have had a change in management recently and all employees have been instructed that we are in no way to pressure customers into any services.  I would love the chance to rectify both of your situations, please give me a call at the shop (530) 7531633. Users/speedeetee

After taking my car to places that turned out to be pretty typical auto shops (overcharging, pressuring you into unneeded services, etc. etc.), I really appreciate SpeeDee  their rates are pretty standard, and I get the impression that they are honest, and I cant express enough how refreshing that is! I needed to replace a pretty expensive part,  and they presented me with all the information I needed, then didnt give me that youll be sorry look when I declined. I hate that look. Oh, and I took my old car there when I thought I had a huge problem with it (turned out to be small), and the mechanic didnt seem the least bit annoyed when I felt like I wasted an hour of his time asking a million questions  thats pretty nice too :) For those of you that have had problems with this place and felt overcharged  youd be surprised how much you learn by going over the receipt and talking to the owner BEFORE you walk out the door.  Users/dontworryaboutit

20100224 12:04:25 nbsp Went in today for some service. I though I needed a tune up again, but after checking it out, they stated I did not need an entire tune up (saved some serious cake). I needed and oil change, and decided to have the powersteering and my 4x4 transmission and transfer case done. They (Theresa and the other gentlemen) never tried to up sale at all. As a matter of fact, they did quite the opposite. They looked up my vehicle and told me what needed to be done when, and none of the service needed to be done at this time. They said I needed and air filter and wipers, and when I told them I would do it myself, there was no further conversation. No deal, no smarmy B.S. they just moved on. I can do most things for regular maint. on a car (Except I dont have a garage to do it with anymore) so I had a good idea of what needed to be done. I felt they were nothing but professional and helpful, and in no way did they even try to screw me a bit. I was very impressed with how polite and curteous they were and they had the car done faster than they said it would. I even called last week to check prices, and was told by Theresa where I could get coupons. I will SURELY be back when I need more service. Thanks Speedee! Users/splewis1977

20100225 11:49:38 nbsp Ok place to get your oil changed, but getting any other involved work done there may be an expensive mistake. Took my car in to get the belt in my window replaced because it was no longer going up or down. Got a call telling me that the other window had also broken (when I told them exactly which window it was, and they had no reason to touch the other one) and that to fix the two of them would be $1,000. Did some research and found that the Speedee in Woodland would do the exact same work for half the price! Ultimately went to Woodland Speedee to save myself $500. Users/kelsey06

20100420 13:25:18 nbsp This place is awful. Originally the car was heating up from we believed was a leak in the radiator and because the car had been sitting so long the battery died too. We went to Speedee to check the radiator and to replace the battery. They told us all they needed to do was replace the radiator cap and fix the rear brakes (and of course replace the battery). We left that day pretty comfortable with a new battery, new rear brakes, and what we thought was the problem fixed. Unfortunately, a week later his car started to heat up again and we found a huge puddle of coolant under the car. We took to another place and they said there was a leak so they fixed. Now a month later the battery is no longer working. I feel that this place really needs to watch what they do because they could be putting people in danger. I do not recommend this place. Users/DChavez
         20100420 13:41:07 nbsp DChavez...This is Teresa, the owner of SpeeDee....I would love to resolve whatever problem your vehicle has with either the battery or the coolant leak. Please contact me at (530) 7531633.  If there are any problems with staff I need to be made aware of them instead of blasted on Wiki.  Thank you for your time. Users/speedeetee

20100703 11:25:04 nbsp I think everyone at Speedees is nice.  However, as a young girl who does not know much about cars and cant fake it either, it is important to me that I can trust the people I get auto service from.  I asked one of the workers at Speedees if he knew of any reason why my car made a rattling sound.  He suggested the engine mount is loose, then proposed that I buy this expensive engine cleaning service to fix it.  Fortunately, I used logic to decide not to buy this service, because it doesnt sound right that loose bolts can be tightened by cleaning.  Once I left, I described the situation in more detail to a friend of mine who used to work at an auto repair shop.  He confirmed that they had tried to rip me off.  Additionally, the high mileage oil is barely different, if at all, from regular oil; but Speedees always tries to convince me that it is much better than regular oil and that I should buy it instead.  I just want someone who can tell me the truth.  I wish theyd admit that if youre tight on money, you will not regret getting conventional oil, and that the repair you need to fix your engine mount is beyond the scope of the services we do here at Speedees.  Instead they exploited my lack of knowledge and tried to rip me off.  They were nice, but I just cannot trust a word they say.  They lost my service. Users/Person
           20100705 09:56:51 nbsp PERSON  Im not sure what technician would tell you that a oil system cleaning would help a motor mount noise, but Id like to find out, and get to the bottom of your complaint. The high mileage oil that we offer is beneficial to vehicles that have over 75,000 miles and it losing oil in between services, if your car doesnt fall into those categories, then it would not be worth the extra money for that oil.  As far as the scope of work we do here at SpeeDee, motor mounts very much fall into the realm of what we do. I have certified mechanics that have years of experience and can work on most types of vehicles. Please give me a call at (530) 7531633 so I can help resolve this issue. I would hate to loose your business for something that I hope can be taken care of.  Thanks, Teresa Users/speedeetee

20100706 01:34:20 nbsp I went here several months back, used a mailer flyer coupon, and like itskim I was also charged for a premium oil filter and when I asked about it the woman at the counter told me that I had a rare oil filter that was unlike other oil filters. Okay, even if thats the truth,  you still shouldnt pass it onto your customers! Seriously, I have a Saturn!! When I got home I asked my Dad what was up (he was.. er, still is?) an auto mechanic and he told me it was all BS. I will never go there again. I mean, everyone was nice, but they were still over charging me. A nice big smile shouldnt cost me an extra $10+ but apparently it does.... I would definitely recommend checking out other places. Users/KaprilWooley

20100708 10:40:03 nbsp KaprilWoolsey  Hi this is Teresa, the owner, I would like to explain the rare filter that is on your vehicle and why there is a $10 upcharge. Most vehicles have a spin on oil filter that costs me x amount. The oil filter that is on your Saturn (and various other vehicles, some newer Toyotas, BMWs, Mercedes) is a canister type oil filter, it costs me more than a regular spin on oil filter. As a business owner I try to absorb most costs I can in order to be fair to my customers, but I cannot absorb it all.  Im sorry if you feel that you were overcharged. I do hope that you would return, we really try to do our best to satisfy everyone.  Users/speedeetee

20100713 09:14:09 nbsp I have been here a few times over the years for oil changes and a belt replacement.  I had to come back the day after the belt replacement to have it tightened down, but otherwise have not had any real problems with this place.  Ive never had what I felt was exceptional service, but they are convenient to me.  They do seem to always be looking to upsell you on something, but they are never pushy, so Im fine with that.

This past Saturday morning, however, I had an experience which will keep me from coming back.  My partner dropped my car off for an oil change and walked home, after telling them that was what she was going to do.  They estimated that it would be an hour,  but they would call when it was finished.  Three hours later, wed not had a call, so headed back down.  We found my car parked in the lot with all of the windows rolled down and the keys in the ignition.  The oil had been changed, as had the sticker.  The interior had not been cleaned, but that didnt occur to me until later.   I went in to find out what was up, and found the office empty.  A woman looked in at me from the shop, then went on with what she was doing for a few more minutes before finally stepping into the office.  She started our conversation by asking What car?  I told her, then asked if they ever had problems with theft.  She told me they never do.  I told her that my car had been in the parking lot with the keys in it and the windows down, and that I thought that was a bad idea.  She responded They usually put them inside.  Ill say something.  She didnt much seem to care, though, and merely charged me then left the office.  I have to speculate in retrospect that the car was waiting to get vacuumed, but that doesnt justify leaving it open in a publicly accessible parking lot, even in Davis.


I cannot advise anyone leave their car in the hands of this place, as they do not seem to mind if your car (or anything inside of it) gets stolen, and the prices are not good enough to justify the risk.
 Users/IAmNewHere

20100719 13:03:27 nbsp Hi IAmNewHere this is Teresa the owner. I just read about your experience and I am very concerned, I will make sure that this is not a regular situation and talk with my staff about the treatment you received. If youd be willing to call me or come down and talk to me I would like to rectify it. I appreciate your business and you should not EVER be treated the way you were Saturday. Please accept my apology.   Users/speedeetee

20100720 10:56:52 nbsp Just got done with my fourth (maybe 5th?) oil change at Speedees and really have nothing to report. At 8:45AM, Tyson was there to greet me and take my information and take the car in for an oil change and a tire rotation. I was out the door by 9:45. Maybe its because the car I took in only has 12K miles on it, but Ive never had to sit through the typical upsale routines that plagued visits to Jiffy Lube, for which I am grateful. Even though I was just sitting there reading magazines, the staff was still friendly and accommodating, no fuss at all.

Im not an expert on cars or car service shops, so when I find one that works, I usually stick with it. I have no major complaints about Speedees, and have been satisfied with every experience Ive had with them. Users/AbbYu

20100725 11:41:26 nbsp Richie did an awesome job for me, tested my battery and determined it was bad, swapped it out with another, and ran another test to be sure everything else was ok. Got me back up and running within 20 minutes! Users/timmytimmy

20100810 11:10:02 nbsp AbbYu and timmytimmy, thanks so much for your comments, I will pass it on to Tyson and Richie! Always good to hear that our staff is doing a good job! Users/speedeetee

20100813 10:31:06 nbsp I just wanted to let everybody know that we have recently hired a mechanic that is able to do more extensive repairs.  We also rethought our upcharges on our oil filters and have decided that only very few oil filters warrant the $10 upcharge. Thank you itskim and KaprilWooley for making me do some research! I hope you will consider returning for you next oil change.   Users/speedeetee

20101027 17:59:36 nbsp Solid place to get your oil change.  This is my fourth consecutive oil change with them after I tried different places because theyre personable, affordable (given you have the $10 coupon), and vacuum my car.  Nadia was my mechanic today and she was great.  She noticed my battery was mediocre and instead of trying to sell me a battery, she asked if my car was still covered under warranty.  I told her it was and she suggested to take it to the dealership to get it taken care of instead of throwing down unnecessary money.

I really cant comment on the other reviewers here who needed other services outside of an oil change, but for the general public who is just looking for a quick oil change and inspection, I highly recommend Speedee. Users/KLouie

20110104 14:20:41 nbsp I just got back from my second oil change from Speedee.  I was incredibly happy with my service.  Nadia worked on my car and gave me a call letting me know that all of my cars fluids looked fine but that a filter needed replaced and quoted me the cost.  I told her that my husband knew how to do it himself, so I passed on the service.  When I went to pick up my car she showed me how to change it (free of charge) just to ensure that we would not make any mistakes!!  I was so appreciative of her helpfulness and have never been so pleased with a mechanic.   Users/AmyHuey

20110514 15:29:40 nbsp I wont take my car here again. They never actually do the 17 point oil change. They always skip things like the vacuuming of the floor, putting air in my tires, filling up the windshield wiper fluid. Also, my boyfriend took his car here and after he got his car back he realized they had left rags sitting on his engine. Great way to start a fire. Users/rachealgalante

20110516 13:58:50 nbsp rachaelgalante the is Teresa the owner, Id like to talk with you about your experience at my shop. As far as I can tell we did vacuum your car and set your tire pressure at your last oil change.  Give me a call so I can take care of your situation.  My cell number is (530) 9021116. Users/speedeetee

20110519 09:34:49 nbsp Wow! What a difference it makes getting my car serviced by a woman. Nadia is awesome...she explained to me how my car checked out after the 17point inspection, told me what is recommended, and gave me a coupon to come back later. I will keep going back as long as she works there :) Users/Tigerlily

20110603 10:43:51 nbsp I really enjoy the service here.  I recently took my car to the dealship for oil change and service and was quite disappointed in the customer service compared to what Ive grown accustomed to at Speedee.  Theyre very professional and with a coupon the price is fantastic for the service.  Im not car expert but my impression is that they always give appropriate advice, keeping in mind that students need to be fiscally conscious!! I definitely recommend Speedee for an oil change at least! Users/KateMaurer

20110630 23:01:45 nbsp havent been there since 2004, after one time oil change, the safe belt light in dashboard never work any more for my year 2000 corolla. Users/jayhsu

20110802 22:33:35 nbsp I always go to Speedee. Teresa is very friendly. However, 2 of my last 3 visits I have had a problem. In January, a few days after my oil was changed I became stranded in Sacramento with my young child when my car wouldnt start. Luckily, my husband worked nearby and was able to come pop the hood and found that the airbox was not tighten after the oil change and had become loose. Recently, I got my oil changed. They informed me my belt was cracked and being nine months pregnant I did not want to it to break one day and be stuck somewhere with an infant and young child so I had it replaced.  A couple days later my car made a loud noise whenever started. Turns out the new belts needed to be tightened. It would have been nice to have been warned of this. I had to take my car in again to have it fixed. I am still a happy customer but am skeptic there wont be a problem a few days later each time I go. I just hope the technicians can be a little more careful especially with my airbox issue becaue this can be troublesome for a mom with young children who knows nothing about cars. Customer service is always great though. Users/Nicvic

20110805 11:59:06 nbsp Nicvic this is Teresa, thank you for the information on your last visits...I will definately bring your concerns up with my staff and make sure that the job we are doing is done correctly.  Next time you are in please find me, Id really like to apologize in person and hopefully gain your trust back. Users/TeresaWanderstadt

20120122 16:03:10 nbsp Great, timely service.  Friendly staff.  Stephanie and the owner (cant recall his name) were very helpful.  I came in thinking my CV joint was the culprit and the mechanic confirmed it.  I was out of there in no time. Users/Watchingthe9erGameRightNow

20120308 00:42:16 nbsp I had a good experience getting my transmission flushed today. The technician was polite and although he did recommend several servicing options (and I did opt for one namely powersteering flush), he pressured me in no way. The quality of the actual service will become clearer in a few more days, but I was out of the door within an hour (starting with expected time of 35 minutes). Users/scrizer

20120407 11:24:36 nbsp Such a great place! Staff is very knowledgeable and helpful. On my most recent visit for an oil change, the tech noticed a headlamp out and that I had purchased a replacement bulb, as I planned to change it myself after the oil change.  He changed it for me!  It was such a nice gesture and a wonderful example of the excellent customer service I have always experienced. Thanks you guys! Users/BombayCollins

20120416 20:30:15 nbsp Everyone was really nice, but my overall experience wasnt so great and I wont be back.

I called ahead for a SMOG check and was informed that it took about half an hour to perform the check. I set up the appointment an hour before I needed to be at work (which is only 10 minutes away from the shop). Even if they ran over by ten minutes, I would still get to work early.

I showed up at the appointed time and no one was at the SMOG check station. I told one of the servicemen that I had an appointment and asked if I needed to go inside to get help. He informed that he could perform the test and that I could wait inside if I wanted to. I asked, again, how long the appointment would take and he confirmed that it would be about half an hour.

By the time I walked into the waiting room, it was 8 minutes past my appointment time. I wasnt worried because even if took 40 minutes at that point, I could still get to work on time. Needless to say, I was very disappointed that it was not 30 or even 40 minutes but one hour past my appointment time when I was finally able to pay my bill and leave. Unfortunately, it also happened to be the time I was supposed to be at work.

Ive got a pretty busy schedule and I have to creatively rearrange it to get extras (like getting my car SMOGed) in. If I had been told it would take an hour before hand it wouldnt have been a problem, I would have rearranged my schedule so that it would have worked (even if it meant being more inconvenient for me). Instead, I was ten minutes late to work. Despite having a coupon, I still feel pretty irked about paying $50 for a service that kept me from getting to my job on time. Users/KatieNoLastName

20120516 17:53:20 nbsp Just had an awful experience here  I went in for an oil change, and was told both of my brake lights were out (!).  No problem, the mechanic says, Its $26 dollars, Ill do it while your oil is being changed, youll be out in no time.  But, I say, from past experience, my lights are difficult to replace, and I dont have time to sit around while you try to figure it out.  No problem, he says, I do it all the time!  Ok, fine, go for it, I say (not wanting to drive around with no brake lights.

5 minutes later, hes back, and says, no, we cant do it, its too hard.  Boss says dont even try.  I could do it, but its going to take forever.  Yeah.  i tried to tell you.  Im not sure whats worse, that he had no idea what he was promising when he said he would do it, that he didnt even acknowledge that I might possess useful information about my own car, or that now Im driving around with no brake lights.

Needless to say, I will be going elsewhere from now on, because if brake lights baffle them, I shudder to think of what else in my car they are incapable of fixing correctly.   Users/SarahCaves

20120612 17:25:56 nbsp This is my place for oil changes and tune ups and tires and anything else I need that they can do. I went in today, and the service that I got was an A++. Jess was my mechanic assistant and he was very straight up and clear about whats going on with my car (I dont speak car!). They dont try to oversell you. They genuinely care about safety when it comes to their recommendations (my tires were about to burst and I didnt even realize it..but they showed me exactly where the problem sites were in person). They even offered to give me a ride to work when I drop off my car tomorrow for new tires (that is care). I crossreferenced their price quotes with my uncle who owns a mechanic shop and they have good deals. Did I mention that they threw in a break inspection for free with the new tires I got through them??! Thanks Speedy (Teresa) for keeping an honest business close to home. I dont usually go out of my way to comment, but this is for the Davis locals.  Users/Arcamedes123

20121127 17:52:29 nbsp Teresa is amazing!  She is incredibly friendly and always takes care of me when I go there.  Dont take your car anywhere else to get your oil changed!!! Users/KieranToovey

20121222 14:03:33 nbsp Im usually afraid of having my car done cuz of previous experiences, but I went to these guys quite a few times since Ive moved here 2 years ago. I got to say, the staff are friendly and knowledgeable and they do the job you ask them to with no problem. I got my oil changed here once, along with my girlfriends car and also a wheel alignment and theyve done a terrific job each time. I lost a cap on one of my tires and I replaced it with one of my bicycle caps, but they replaced it with a metal replacement one when I got my alignment done. The mechanics are really nice, and after finishing my car they told me what they recommend on changing on my car so it can perform at its best. I havent gone anywhere else but these guys, so I recommend them :) Users/Jondguzman

20140515 22:25:23 nbsp SpeeDee is great!  Ive never had a problem taking my car here.  I get oil changes there regularly.  When my cooling pump failed, they were able to help me find a reasonably priced option for fixing it.  Ive had my brakes done here as well a couple of times.  One time the brakes were making noise and pulsing, but the mechanic told me the rotors just needed resurfacing.  I didnt need all new brakes.  Thats pretty awesome, because I wouldnt have known any better.  The mechanics offer suggestions but theres no pressure to have more work done than you need.  Everyones super friendly.  Today when I was there, Theresa even gave me tips on where to find coupons.  Thats amazing service. Users/MicheleTobias
