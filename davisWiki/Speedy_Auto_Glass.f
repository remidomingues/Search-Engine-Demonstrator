Speedy Auto Glass Inc. is the only automobile glass replacement business in town. That does not mean that other automobile repair shops wont fix your window. Its also a good idea to call Woodland and Sacramento businesses for estimates. They often will come out to their customers for repairs at no extra cost.

Speedy, is in fact quite speedy. They try their best to get your new window in the same day as long as they have enough time to get the glass from the glass warehouses in Sacramento. The shop is fairly sizeable and they seem to do plenty of business.


20060109 19:12:52 nbsp After calling around to every local shop, Speedy had the best price for my repair. In fact, they were 1/3 the price of some Woodland shops! They also beat their own first quote after I found another shop that would do it for the same amount. It took about six hours from the time that I called them to the time that I drove my car away with a new window. Their phone service was probably the worst out of all of the places that I called but to me price is the bottom line. Users/JackHaskel

20060109 21:38:50 nbsp Theyve replaced windshields on two cars for me over the last couple of years.  I was bummed at having to have the windshields replaced, but Speedy did a fine job, completed the work on time, on budget, and without any slimy tricks or shortcuts. Users/GrahamFreeman

20060411 10:29:04 nbsp I just had a window replaced at Speedy after some friendly people broke into my car via my window and stole my stereo. I called Speedy on Sunday night, and got a human! I called back the next morning to follow up, and got another, equallypleasant human! She was informative, polite, friendly, and helpful. I arrived at Speedy at our agreedupon time, and was informed that the window install could take a couple of hours. Fortyfive minutes later they called me and told me it was done! I returned to the shop, to find that not only did they expertly install a new window, they also vacuumed up all the remaining glass shards that had been strewn about my car. I couldnt have done a better job if Id tried. Im sure theres a company out there that would charge to clean the glass from your car, but Speedy did it as a courtesy, and Speedily.  ) Users/MegSmith

20060411 16:16:56 nbsp Ill never have my windows replaced by Speedy.  They werent the cheapest ones but I figured its close and resonable price.  I made an appointment and when I called back to confirm it, they said I never made one.  Then they said they found me in their system (after 10 minutes) and the glass was sent to CITRUS HEIGHTS and not Davis.  I told them Id never get any glass done by them ever. Users/JoAnnaRich

20060925 22:27:52 nbsp Today, Speedy changed out a shattered window on my car (car thieves are scum) and I was very impressed with their service.  I made an appt in the morning, drove in that afternoon, and they changed out my window in 10 minutes!  Users/PeterAnselmo

20070331 16:24:58 nbsp Speedy installed a drivers side window in my car and did an average job.  Cannot comment on price as I needed it done quickly.  Poor service included installing a dirty window (not even Windexed!) and incomplete vacuuming of interior leaving shards of glass behind.  This place needs better attention to detail, installing a dirty window and not vacuuming thorougly is inexcuseable!!!!!!! Users/UsetheForce

20090216 16:28:12 nbsp I would be careful of this business and their dubious quotes.  I called the Speedy store in Davis and got an over the phone quote of $350 for a windshield replacement (more than the dealer quoted me).  I then did an online quote through the national speedy website, and got a quote of $199.  I booked it online with the $199 quote, and then I got a phone call where I was told that the online quote did not include a $30 fee for the rubber seal.  I questioned why it wasnt included in the quote and she said that its not required for all vehicles, only some and that the online system was not capable of knowing when it’s needed.  I told her that did not make any sense since one has to select the year, make, and model of the car.   She then proceeded to claim that the website included a disclaimer that stated additional charges may apply for a seal.   I still had the website in front of me, there was no such disclaimer.   I told her I didn’t appreciate their bate and switch practices, and that I would go with another company that gives honest quotes.   Users/DP46

20090218 16:08:49 nbsp they try to squeeze every cent out of you. and long long waits for things that you can get done in 10 mins somewhere else. avoid them. Users/leiris

20090520 08:36:41 nbsp I took my Honda Civic to get the windshield replaced yesterday. The mechanic was really nice, and it cost me $182 which was the same as the estimate over the phone. I called a place in Woodland that wanted $304, quite steep compared to what Speedy charged me. The wait wasnt too long, either  he began to work on my car as soon as I brought it in after work, and the wait was simply to let the glue and such seal. Users/ChristyMarsden

20090715 14:50:49 nbsp Speedy glass really is speedy. And Cheap. With everything that this implies. My windshield for a 00 Passat came to just $215. However, the glass was not optically perfect, the seals did not match up 100% and the rearview mirrior fell off after two weeks (they did glue this back on for free). The quality of the product is sacrificed to achieve low prices, but it is much cheaper than glass from the dealer for genuine glass. I would take my daily driver or beater car there again, but I would not take an weekend/exotic/rare/quality car there for glass replacements. Materials are just not up to par. No complaints about the service.  Users/xen0cide

20090731 15:09:54 nbsp I just got my cars windshield replaced, and had a very positive experience. Price was very good compared to what I saw at other places, and as advertised, was very speedy! Afterwards, though, I noticed a whistling sound, so I called, and again very speedily, they came out for no charge, back to my house, and fixed it. Nice people on the phone, nice technician, Id use them again... not that I enjoy replacing windshields. Users/DavidBenjamin

20091221 09:43:01 nbsp In the past I have had three positive experiences with Speedy Auto Glass; one chip fill and two replacements. With the replacements they have a warranty that I had never needed to use until this month. Earlier this month I had my windshield replaced. Within a week it had a crack along the bottom that started at the bottom edge of the glass. Speedy said that it was not covered by the warranty because the crack originated with an impact point. The service guy pointed to a part of the crack that looked like every other part of the crack and told me that that was the impact point. I couldnt see it. I still dont believe this wasnt a stress fracture or installer error. I feel swindled and Im not going back to Speedy anytime soon. Users/GJC02

20100830 14:28:05 nbsp Someone busted in the drivers side window on my car.  I looked online and got several quotes for a replacement.  Speedy had the cheapest quote.  I booked online on a Sunday, and the earliest appointment I could make was a Tuesday.  Monday morning Speedy called me and asked if I would like to move up to an appointment that afternoon.  I accepted and was pleased that I got an earlier appointment.  The girl that called me also let me know that the Davis location was going to give me a better price than what I was quoted.  Their mobile service was free and they came out to me, cleaned the glass out of my car, and replaced the window faster than they said they would.  Everyone I talked to, including the technician, were all very nice and friendly.  I feel I got a very high quality service for a very cheap price.  I would recommend them to anyone.

20110627 18:25:17 nbsp They claimed the window regulator was broken in my passenger door. Either they blatantly lied or are incompetent, but is it was working properly and merely had a cable pop out that likely happened when someone in Sac busted the window out.  Users/DTM

20120404 11:11:11 nbsp I had a very good experience here last week having my windshield replaced. They beat the price from the national speedy website, and got me in the next day.  Easy peasy. Users/ScottB

20120821 15:11:13 nbsp Had a very good experience. Called them, got in that day. Was very nice about blowing out the wiper washer system that was clogged on one side. Watched the process. It was all done very well. Guy is kind of quiet. Not a talkative place. But do the work well and are friendly. Users/YogaBhoga
