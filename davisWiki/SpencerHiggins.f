My Fellow Students,

ASUCD needs an overhaul. For too long the students have been neglected, the general population underrepresented and too long has our money been misspent and perverted. Our budget is sporadic and inefficient; it needs to be taken in an entirely new direction. More money needs to be distributed to campus clubs, organizations and students’ hands.

As ASUCD President, I will give more money back to students through services, entertainment and cash. I propose wage increases, discounts for student employees and more money for Club Finance Council. I will work to reinvigorate on campus entertainment and will work for more student outreach and advocacy.

I want to do these things because we deserve it. We, as students of UC Davis, deserve a student government that gives back. We deserve to leave this school knowing that these were the best years of our lives. We are proud, We are Aggies!

On February 21, vote for the party that will make you be proud to be an Aggie, Vote Student Focus.

It’s Time for Change,
Spencer Higgins
ASUCD Presidential Candidate
Student Focus

Spencer has on occassion been called slut by Users/DanXie.  He likes to have breaks every hour at ASUCD Senate meetings.


Hey there  welcome to the wiki.  I readded the old stuff on the page Spencer Higgins because that page is designed to be biographical and not edited by you.  Check out the Wiki Style Guide.  This page, without the space in the name, is your user page  a place for you to put information about yourself, etc.  It seems confusing, but thats only because you also have a biographical page, due to your ASUCD involvement.

20070123 18:21:55 nbsp wow my page sucks... i should put stuff up about my campaign Users/SpencerHiggins

20070123 22:59:31 nbsp You say that too long has our money been misspent and perverted...I dont exactly know what you mean.  How, over the past year, has money been spent in a perverted manner, and when such perverted spending was proposed, did you vote against it as a Senator?    Users/PaulHarms

So, in response, because I am so interested in your seemingly philanthropic proposal. So I can have actual apparent facts, could you perhaps email me a copy of this noted shootout bill that was withdrawn before making it to the floor? ~Users/DavePoole
