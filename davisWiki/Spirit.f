Spirit gas station was located at the intersection of Mace Blvd. and Interstate 80, right next to the Valero gas station. Usually, the price per gallon is equal to the price at Valero. The minimart at Spirit is a lot smaller than the one at Valero. On 20071116, this location became a Shell Shell Station; its departure was also noted on http://www.yelp.com/biz/sullQ9_zjTJAKUBM3T4fNw#hrid:zjCLCNucR_XUq3oGqKKfTA yelp. There is still another wiki:WikiMapia:46949 branch of Spirit in wiki:WikiPedia:Parkville, Maryland and another near Cleveland and a http://www.interskaterollerskating.com/directions.htm roller rink. For a coupon that expires in 2009 but might still be useless, see http://daviscouponsonline.com/davisspirit/. This phone number still works for the location and the person who answered said the owners are the same, they just wanted a different brand of gas. They said that the brand actually changed Friday November 16.

Spirit is not to be confused with Spirit Halloween, which has opened up a temporary store inside of the former Borders location in Davis Commons.
