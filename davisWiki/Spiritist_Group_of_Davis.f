The Spiritist Group of Davis group was founded in 2005 by a UCD student and a Townies nonstudent. The Spiritist Movement dates back to 1857, beginning with the publication of the book The Spirits Book by Allan Kardec.

Study Group (weekly meetings) are held on Mondays 7:008:30 PM in Wellman Hall, room 109.

## Editor note: I emailed them on 2008.03.06 to verify the group was still active.  JabberWokky
