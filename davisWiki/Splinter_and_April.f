Rats are excellent pets.  I got these from the http://candirats.tripod.com/ CandiRats Rattery in Sacramento.  She really does a great job and Im sure I got healthier rats from her compared to Petco

Splinter loves to lick people, possibly because I used to have her lick jam off my finger when she was good.  April loves to copy what Splinter is doing.  The love living in The 230
