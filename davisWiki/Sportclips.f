20120911 17:11:38 nbsp Went there to get my hair cut...and WOW!! Just wow! The service was amazing! My hair looked great and was exactly what I asked for! The hairwash/hot towel facial/massage chair combo is pure bliss. Highly recommend them, as they cost about the same as other in town barber shops, but leave you feeling like you got your moneys worth!  Users/FriendlyNeighborhoodAnon
