Sports2Kids is a Locally Owned Websites website created in 2003 by UC Davis students for Bay Butler Bay Butlers ARE 112 Business Organization class.  The website was born out of a partnership with the http://www.sacymca.org/ Sacramento YMCA to obtain new and used sports equipment for the kids who use YMCA services.

Sports2Kids handles the collection of sports equipment from Davis and Sacramento area residents, which is coordinated through the website.  This equipment is then passed along to the YMCA.

The YMCA has use for almost any sports equipment, but has specific needs for:
  Basketball Basketballs
  Soccer balls
  Floor hockey equipment
  Tball equipment (stands, throwdown bases, etc.)
  Tetherball equipment
  Volley ball equipment
  Hulahoops
  Jump ropes
  Ping pong tables
  Foosball tables
  Air hockey tables

Sports2Kids operates with the full permission of the Sacramento YMCA.
