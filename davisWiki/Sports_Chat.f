Sports Chat, otherwise known as The Brett and Chuck Power Hour, is a onehour sports radio stations radio program on local community radio KDRT. The show airs live each week from 11:00am12:00pm each Friday midday. The show reairs on Saturday morning from 8:009:00.

Sports Chat is cohosted by Davis residents Brett Andersen and C.J. Garcia. The show discusses national sports news, including but not limited to football, basketball, baseball and soccer. The local flavor discussed on the show includes the UC Davis Aggies and the Davis High Blue Devils. Listeners can phone in (530)7921648 to contribute to the thoughts on the show or ridicule the hosts biased sports commentary.

Special guests previously on the show include Yahoo! sports writer Michael Silver, and local (and one now distant) Davis residents Will Robinson and Evan Ream, writers on the renowned blog The Sack Lunch Blog.

The Sports Chat cohosts have a radio bucket list, which is a group of 10 individuals who the pair dream of having on the air at some point in time. There is varying reason for the ten on the list, some reasons which are sensible and some which even the hosts cannot explain. The ten include:

1. Bruce Bochy, San Francisco Giants manager
2. Dez Bryant, Dallas Cowboys wide receiver
3. John Isner/Nicolas Mahut, who in 2010 played the longest tennis match in history
4. Eric Musselman, head coach of the NBA Development League, Reno Bighorns
5. Iniesta, Spanish futbol player
6. Tyler Thomas, former Oregon State offensive lineman
7. Martin Truax Jr., NASCAR driver
8. Rusty Bumgarner, USA Slowpitch softball phenomenon
9. Jeff Shaw, KDRT head honcho
10. Daunte Culpepper or Dennis Green, quarterback and head coach, respectively, of the Sacramento Mountain Lions UFL football team

If you or anyone you know has access to getting one of these individuals featured on Sports Chat, you will go down in history as one of the greatest Sports Chat supporters ever and be forever a legend on their show.
