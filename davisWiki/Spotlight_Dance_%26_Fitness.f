For students at UC Davis who are interested in learning how to ballroom dance, owner Gwen Burton and fellow teacher Donnelle Yoshino teach several social dance classes, ranging from beginning, continuing, to intermediate/advanced, through the http://asucd.ucdavis.edu/experimentalcollege/index.cfm Experimental College. This is a good way to quickly learn the basics of how to dance, and convenient for Davis students.
