In Spring 2010, the ASUCD held a special ASUCD Elections Election.  On the ballot were two issues:

A vote of no confidence in Mark Yudof:
 Passed, 986 for, 103 against, and 25 abstain
 N  1114, 88.5% yes

A vote of no confidence in the UC Regents:
 Passed, 993 for, 91 against, and 26 abstain
 N  1100, 89.5% yes


No .blt files were made available for this election, which had only ~5% turnout.  The actual text of the measures is no longer available on the ASUCD website.

Theres no word on why the UC Regents are Most Hated Person on Campus more hated than Yudof.

However, this vote came a couple of months after http://markyudof.com/ Yudofs decision to resign.
 Keep dreaming.
