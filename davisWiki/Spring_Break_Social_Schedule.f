Hello people Users/MichaelAWoods I know. And possibly people I do not. If you are reading this and upset with its use, make a comment, and leave us be. Ill find a better scheduler in the future.

To everyone else...
 Spring Break! 

Our week of ignoring work is finally here, and all of us deserve a week of rest, social activities, and what ever the hell we want it to be. If we all want to have some Wiki Gatherings gatherings, let us make people aware of them here. Note: We dont need to pack the schedule... but if you have an idea, sketch it out. Edit this wiki page directly to add or edit an event  leave a comment at the bottom for... comments.  In addition, check out the Events Board for things going on, that may or may not be spring break related http://tnjn.com/2008/mar/11/springbreakistimeofintell/ Spring break is time of intelligent debauchery.
