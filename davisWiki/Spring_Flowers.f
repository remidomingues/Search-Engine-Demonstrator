The fertile ground in this part of the Central California Central Valley is good not just for fruits and vegetables, but a great variety of other plants.  During late Weather winter and spring you can see flowers on trees, bushes, and on the ground throughout the city.

  Well, the wiki is an interconnected community effort to explore, discuss and compile anything and everything about Davis â€” especially the little, enjoyable things.  Id say spring flowers count among the little, enjoyable things about Davis. Users/CovertProfessor

20070614 14:29:16 nbsp They do, but there is already a Town Flora flora page that has different species and cultivars that people can explore further in depth and includes miscellaneous pictures. This page seems more like a photo gallery than anything of substance. I suppose it could be edited to include the plethora of flowering plants in spring and the country feel they give to the town. Especially after the seasonal depression of Winter.  Users/CarlosOverstreet

20070614 21:11:03 nbsp Yes, but the Town Flora flora page is about the factual nature of flowers, while this is more about aesthetic appreciation of them.  I like it. Users/JabberWokky

20070614 21:19:33 nbsp I see your point, Carlos, and I also agree that more pictures would help.  I love the diversity of flowers that you see in peoples gardens, and more of those pictures would be nice. Users/CovertProfessor

20070614 21:21:21 nbsp OK. How do you think we could best make this page better than what it was. Users/CarlosOverstreet

20070614 21:48:47 nbsp Floral Beauty?  Places to see Flowers?  Just like an entry about pets versus an entry about animals, this is flowersasbeauty versus flowersasspecies?  Thats how I envision it, but it could go in several different directions at this point. Users/JabberWokky

20070615 01:27:23 nbsp Should we organize it into sections, say Flower Gardens, and Misc Flora?  Users/CarlosOverstreet

20070615 09:12:56 nbsp I think, like Shadiness Factor, there doesnt need to be much formal organization (yes, I am the same guy who constantly adds headers to some entries).  Some entries are best left less structured, a la an art gallery.  These are pretty pictures of the flowers in Davis. Users/JabberWokky

20070615 17:59:44 nbsp We could call it Stop and Smell the Davis Flowers and add it to the various lists of things to do in Davis...  :) Users/CovertProfessor
    I like that... for some reason this reminds me of The Grass Sidewalk and other lighthearted capture the feeling entries. Users/JabberWokky

20080504 13:14:36 nbsp poppies come up in the grande school site, or at least they did Users/StevenDaubert

20130502 23:17:10 nbsp I think it would be helpful to add times when the flowers on this page bloom.  Users/CarlosOverstreet
