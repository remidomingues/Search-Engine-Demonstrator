Sprouts Childcare is a licensed large home Child Care daycare located in South Davis. At Sprouts they state their belief that at young ages children learn through play and interaction. Almost any routine interaction can be turned into a learning experience or opportunity for creative thinking.  They also believe that children learn in different ways and at different rates according to each individual child. Sprouts provides a safe and nurturing environment that inspires children to become independent learners, without pressure to meet any developmental milestones.

Sprouts offers a low caregiver to child ratio (with a maximum of 10 children enrolled). It is solely operated by the owner and an assistant to maintain consistency. Sprouts has two yards for outside play and is within walking distance to Pioneer Park. Activities will include free playtime and structured playtime. Indoor and outdoor activities will encourage small and large motor development. They will have story time throughout the day to encourage language and love for books, and a range of creative art activities including art, music, dancing and puppets. All children will be encouraged to participate in structured activities, but no child will be forced or punished for not participating.

Other activities will include age appropriate  preschool readiness such as learning the alphabet, shapes, colors, numbers, animals, social skills and feelings. Children will be given the opportunity to explore and create in an open, nurturing and safe environment to promote good self esteem and confidence. They provide nutritious food to promote healthy eating and integrate good personal hygiene and manners into daily interaction and activities.

Sprouts operates year round and accepts children ages 12 months  5 years old. Our hours are Monday through Friday; 8am4:30pm. (Early drop off or later pick up may be negotiable.) Sprouts offers fulltime (8am4:30pm) openings; Monday through Friday, and parttime 35 days per week 8am1pm. Please call 5307562613 for more information. References are available on request.


20121222 05:57:56 nbsp Sprouts has been a wonderfully enriching environment for my child.

Before discovering Sprouts we tried a large group care facility (Hutchinson) and a smaller inhome day care on Haussler Drive.
When going to the previous inhome care our child would cry and scream on the way in.
Not so with Sprouts! Julie and Lou are so warm, caring, and passionate towards the children they care for.
They really went the extra mile to help our child feel at ease there.
Now he looks forward to going every day and many days doesnt want to leave when we pick him up!

Julies program also helps children make developmental strides in language learning, creativity, basic life skills, and social skills.
They inspired enthusiasm in our child towards toothbrushing, handwashing, and taught him how to communicate gently and playfully with other children without crying, hitting, fighting, biting, etc.
The Sprouts halfday program takes some extra effort for families with two working parents like mine, but seems worthwhile.
Among the group care options and nannies we have experienced in Davis, Julies program is the best of the bunch.

20130710 19:21:03 nbsp We have had a great experience with our daughter at Sprouts. The atmosphere is inviting, safe, and fun.  Owner Julie is great with the kids as is her assistant Megan.  When we go to Pioneer Park at night our daughter tries to walk back to Sprouts she likes it so much.  Users/JohnDrumm

20140121 10:40:45 nbsp Our child attended Sprouts Day School/Child Care for two (2) years and we were extraordinarily happy with the care she received from Julie and her staff.  The kids always seem happy, wellrested, wellfed, and engaged in a variety of activities that support balanced cognitive and motor (gross and fine) development as well.  We also appreciated Julies support and wealth of knowledge and experience in tackling issues from potty training to sleep training and toddler discipline.  Should we have another child, we can not imagine sending them anywhere else. Users/JoyNichols

20140720 15:17:57 nbsp My wife recently decided to try and send our son to this daycare. In order to hold a place we had to put a deposit down very quickly, unfortunately I did not have a lot of time to research the daycare myself because I work fulltime. There were a few red flags for me from the beginning. First this daycare does not carry liability insurance, and the owner of the daycare does not own the house where she runs her business, so if something happens to your child there is not much you can do. Second my wife informed me they take the children to the park next to the house, which is not necessarily a bad thing but I wanted to see the park myself before I judged to harshly.
Third, my wife also informed me that when she contacted licensing, this daycare had been sited for hiring an employee before a finger print and backround check had cleared. Again I did not want to judge to harshly since I am sure the owner learned from this and would not repeat such a mistake. So we put down a deposit.

So I took my son to the park and the equipment was just OK, my son slipped on one of the play equipment areas. The park seemed dingy and during our visit there were a lot off people with off leash dogs in the park. There have been a few children bitten by off leash dogs in Davis very recently so this raised my concern. When a dog approached us I picked up my son and asked the dogs owner to please get his dog; he did nothing. Now if a daycare takes about a dozen children to this park, and only has 13 people watching the children of different ages, my concern is that they would not be able to handle a situation with an off leash dog.

So with two weeks to go before he was supposed to start, we decided that our son was thriving in the daycare he is currently in and with my concern for his safety in the hands of a business with no insurance, we decided to not change to this daycare. When my wife informed the owner, the response was sorry the deposit was nonrefundable, which is stated in the 12 page handbook, and is on a page that has nothing to do with payment terms. The owner stated that she had turned people away. In my experience with daycares they always have a wait list, so I dont imagine that it would be hard to fill my sons spot. Now I do understand the idea of a deposit but since adequate time was given, at least in my opinion, returning the $360 deposit should not be an issue.

But I guess the joke is on us. I have found when it comes to money I think you can get a good sense of the type of people you are dealing with. If the roles were reversed I would gladly return the deposit as I would like to believe most people would. Perhaps they will use it to get liability insurance. So my advise to parents in looking for a daycare, dont just check with licensing, be wary about situations with nonrefundable deposits, and get to know the area before you are too rushed to commit.  For any parents that read this I hope that you will not repeat such a mistake. Users/GlennOpp

With regard to the negative review listed above by GlennOpp~
Im sorry that you felt rushed to put down a deposit. It would have been helpful to have met you in person or even speak over the phone about all of the concerns you were having regarding my childcare environment. Your wife contacted me numerous times over the last several months inquiring about space for your son and there was ample time to address any red flags you were experiencing.

It is standard in childcare businesses to require a deposit to hold a space. Providers do this to avoid holding a space without any compensation if the family changes their mind, has a sudden life change, etc... and cannot fulfill their agreement to join the childcare, and other families are told that there are no spaces in the interim. The deposit is applied to the 1st week of care and the last week whenever that falls, so for families who do enroll their children, the cost of the deposit is absorbed into their tuition. I do have a comprehensive booklet of information detailing various policies so that families have clear information about the terms and conditions before they commit to reserving a space. If families take the time to review the information provided and communicate their concerns prior to signing an agreement to reserve a space, the deposit will be returned. It is only after an agreement is made and the space is reserved that the deposit becomes nonrefundable.

I have been providing childcare for 6 years and cared for several dozen children over those years, none of which have incurred an injury requiring more than a bandaid. We have a higher caregiver to child ratio than is required by the state. Not every care environment is right for every family, and you have every right to choose a care environment that you feel is best for you and your child. Best of luck~ Sprouts Childcare

20140724 23:11:27 nbsp Sprouts is an absolute GEM in Davis!  My children were lovingly cared for by Julie for two years.  When my previous nanny had to leave our family, a friend immediately referred us to Sprouts.  During our experience with Sprouts, I remember my children running with enthusiasm to be the first ones in her door each morning, unending support as I struggled to pottytrain my son, and feeling like I truly had a second Mommy to care for my children while I was at work.  Her home was safe, clean, playful, and well organized.  She creatively and carefully presented ageappropriate learning activities to various children.  I loved that Pioneer park was so near and have personally observed Julie carefully monitoring and safely managing various children in her care.  I found her policies and procedures to be clearly outlined and as a parent with a child in her care, she communicated with me effortlessly.  Julie has excellent instincts, a caring heart, and I am forever indebted to her for creating the type of atmosphere where my young children could thrive and be deeply loved.   Users/StephanieRoberts

20140725 07:11:44 nbsp I have nothing but good things to say about Sprouts Childcare.  My two children have had the great fortune of attending Sprouts and both have absolutely thrived there.  My daughter, near kinder age, was stimulated by the focus on art, stories, investigative science experiences, and thoughtful conversation with Julie and her capable assisstant.  My son, who started with Sprouts at age two, absolutely loves it.  In his words  when I go Julies, I love to play inside and play outside.  Julie is warm and caring and goes above and beyond in making Sprouts basically a really awesome second home for the young children she serves.  All the children are happy and peaceful while at Sprouts. Julie handles conflicts in such a kind and respectful way, this rubs off on the children, and in the probably over two or three hundred times I have entered Sprouts, I have never seen children misbehaving or acting unsafe in any way, in fact a feeling of kindness and contentment permeates the space.  Bonus: Sprouts is next to one of the nicer play structure parks in Davis, a shady park the kids visit often and where you dont have to even cross a street to get to.  As a working mom, knowing my kids get such well supervised and fun outdoor time during the day, I feel this is a very healthy and necessary part of their development.  In fact, having such incredible care for my children thanks to Sprouts is what allows me to be able to go to work happily and productively each day, and I thank Julie and her program immensely.

I am a former Montessori teacher and private school administrator.  I have been fortunate enough to both teach young children myself and observe in dozens of classrooms. In all honesty, I was very very picky about where I was willing to leave my son when he needed part time care at 17 months.  He’s two now and has been with Julie for the last eight months. Luckily, I don’t think we could have found a better caregiver.

Julie has created an incredible home childcare environment at Sprouts. You can feel it in the kids’ behavior and demeanor when you walk in. It’s unusually peaceful and respectful . Shes a talented teacher and an incredibly caring person.  Our son sometimes says “Me wanna go to Julie’s house and see Julie” when he’s at home.

In response to GlennOp’s concern about the trips to Pioneer Park, I understand because I’ve had some of the same worries myself.  However, I felt completely comfortable after observing directly how Julie handles the kids at Pioneer. The children all know the rules and she keeps them close.  Actually, my husband had a chance to watch Julie and her assistants bring kids to the park on many occasions over the course of a year, while he was still at home with our son.  Those unintentional observations were the reason we decided to enroll him in Sprouts in the first place. We’ve seen other providers out and about in Davis, and decided to avoid them because of what we observed. The excellent quality of care Julie gives just stands out.  And we love that our son can still enjoy playing outside while we’re at work. I wholeheartedly recommend Sprouts to any questioning parents out there.

20140728 15:37:11 nbsp Julie cared for my daughter from 20082009 and my son from 20132014. She takes excellent care of kids and has lots of great things from them to do. She is particually good and interacting with the kids and teaching them how to get along. She taught my son how to share, how to speak up for himself, how to make new friends. My son has a speech delay and made lots of progress with speech while he was here. She also serves a healthy lunch which saves times and helps the kids try new foods. My only complaint is that I wish Julie lived closer to my house :) Users/TheresaPistochini
