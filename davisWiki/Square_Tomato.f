The square tomato, AKA cultivar VF145, is a renowned type of Tomatoes tomato that was developed at UC Davis.  Interestingly enough, it is not actually square in shape any more than Coral Bells are made from coral or Baby Tears are related to crying infants.  However, the tomato is called square because it was developed to be less round than other tomatoes so as not to roll off conveyor belts; in addition to this improvement, these tomatoes pack into boxes better and ship with fewer losses (e.g., ripped or smashed tomatoes) because of an increased skin durability.  Most of the tomatoes you find in the supermarket are square tomatoes.

In the early 1950s, Californias tomato industry was threatened due to a lack of laborers to harvest the crops.  In response, the UC Davis Biological and Agricultural Engineering Agricultural Engineering department developed a mechanical tomato harvester. Unfortunately, this machine crushed the tomatoes.

The Vegetable Crops Vegetable Crops Department came to the rescue by breeding a firmerskinned tomatoalso known as the square tomatothat the machine could not crush, thus keeping Californias tomato industry alive.  The actual inventor of the square tomato was Gordie Jack C. Hanna, Associate in the Agricultural Experiment Station and Professor in Truck Crops, University of California, Davis (19381967).  The conference room of Asmundson Hall is known as the Jack Hanna room.  The walls are covered with plaques, photos, awards, and certificates commending Jack Hanna for his work, especially from the tomato industry.
##Im pretty sure this made the university a ton of money for a long time, but Ill ask someone before I write it up as fact, Ive forgotten.

Hanna worked right off the fields by Hutchison Drive.  He would stand in the fields, walk among the plants collecting random tomatoes, and then go and throw them out onto the road as a test.  He kept and rebred from the plants featuring tomatoes hardy enough to survive his test, eventually giving us the hardy tomato that can withstand being picked by machine and transported by truck.

Both the square tomato and the tomato harvester were embraced by the processingtomato industry.  Processing tomatoes are harvested by large machines, dumped into those white bins you see semitrucks pulling, and transported off to the nearest processing plant.  You can always tell when its tomatopickin time by the dozens of tomatoes on the side of the highway.

According to the http://www.ucdavis.edu/spotlight/1105/aggie_celebs.html UC Davis Spotlight article, Gordie Jack Hanna was the first to take a good, hard look at the round, ripe tomato and announce: We’ve got a serious problem here.  Hoping to rid the world of the dastardly spherical burgertoppers, Hanna introduced the first square tomato in the early 1950s.  Ironically, the square tomato isn’t really that cubical.  Nevertheless, most of the tomatoes you see in grocery stores today are of the Gordie Hanna variety.

The square tomato was featured on an episode of Modern Marvels, with local UC Davis professors explaining how important it was for the tomato industry.

Professor Emeritus Bob Sommer is noted for critiquing the wisdom of the square tomato in the mid 1960s.  The story is recounted in one of his books (probably Expertland, 1963  any bored wikifairies in Shields Library can verify this) has some commentary on the square tomato being an engineering marvel but a culinary tragedy.  Sommer has also stated that if Davis hadnt become well known for bicycling, it would probably be been best known for inventing the square tomato.   UCD student Ted Buehler used this analogy in his presentation on the history and future of bicycling in Davis in Feb 2007.   See image 43 (My Conclusions) of his Bicycle History Presentation.
