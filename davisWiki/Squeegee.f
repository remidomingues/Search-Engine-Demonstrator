20081020 22:37:10 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy Mr. or Ms. Squeegee (Mr. Gee?), and Welcome to the Wiki!   You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you (or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here).  Plus, youre part of Davis, and it would look odd for a Squeegee to be commenting on restaurants.  Unless of course you introduce yourself to your neighbors as Squeegee... which is possible, I suppose.  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for updating the Screaming Squeegee entry.  I readded the history, moved the old logo down and updated it with the current logos... the wiki is a resource for all of Davis, including the history of Davis, and the history of Screaming Squeegee is part of the history of Davis.  A pretty neat part, too.   Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
