Squirrels may be the second most populous Town Wildlife large animal after Ducks ducks in the Arboretum arboretum.  (In fact, if you count ground squirrels and arboreal squirrels in the same category (much as all ducks could be lumped together), there are probably a lot more squirrels.)  Easily the most visible rodent species in Davis, the fox squirrel (Sciurus niger) makes its home in trees all around the city.  While most (if not all) of the squirrels in Davis are brown, some areas (notably http://skyways.lib.ks.us/kansas/towns/Marysville/squirrel.html Marysville, KS and Washington DC) have significant populations of black squirrels (they are the same species, just a different color).

Their name is actually quite poetic.  It derives from an ancient Greek word meaning shadow tailed.

Both ground squirrels and tree squirrels can damage plants and crops. Ground squirrels are a problem on farms, while tree squirrels harm garden and landscape plants in town. Tree squirrels are a protected game species, so they can only be killed during squirrel hunting season. They are considered edible. Ground squirrels are not protected. They dont taste good.
http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn7438.html Management guidelines here.
Tree squirrels were not a problem in Davis until the 1990s. First reports of damage in gardens came in from southeast Davis and El Macero. Within a couple of years tree squirrels were throughout South Davis, then East Davis. By the mid2000s tree squirrels were in Central and North Davis, and now damage reports come from all parts of town.

Tree squirrels are extremely numerous on the UCD campus, spawning the Fox Squirrel Contraceptive Research Project.  The project has two key objectives: to reduce the campus fox squirrel population before they cause problems, and to test a new birthcontrol drug that wildlife biologists hope will help them manage other mammals that are pests in some places, such as deer and ground squirrels.  The goal is to limit their ecological and humanhealth impacts as effectively and humanely as possible. http://www.news.ucdavis.edu/search/news_detail.lasso?id8845 This article has further details.

20060217 21:49:21 nbsp Fact: baby squirrels are called kittens Users/KrisFricke
    AFAIK, like most (all?) rodents, they are called pups, with the males being kits and the females being kittens.  All the rodent breeders, associations and vets Ive run into generally just call them pups (I think since sexing is difficult at an early age).  Squirrels might be an exception, but Ive always heard it was for all rodents.  Users/JabberWokky, peromyscus and fancy mice fan.

20070324 22:57:47 nbsp 10 years ago there were no tree squirrels on campus. Maybe they were in other parts of Davis (I dont think so) but certainly not on campus. Where did they come from? Users/JimEvans

20070512 21:32:38 nbsp Someone could have brought some squirrels onto campus in hopes of starting a population on campus. Some people did that with Black Squirrels at Kent State.

20070516 13:24:22 nbsp The other day I saw two bluebirds fighting a squirrel.  The birds were jumping around on the ground and then swooping up and attacking the squirrel and the squirrel swatting at them.  Also, I once saw a squirrel beatboxing around 5 or 6 in the morning.  It was frightening. Users/BrianTrott

  Hmm, Im not so sure about this, when I moved to davis in 99 there were no tree squirrels to be found in most of the city, since then the Eastern Fox squirrels have expanded rapidly taking over much of campus but youll notice not to far into the rest of town yet. I doubt house cats had much to do with this. Users/AlexMandel
    Ive now seen tree squirrels in the Stonegate area (far west Davis). So, the spreading of tree squirrels appears to be continuing.
 The brown tree squirrells are certainly exploding population wise in the last 2 years, they were just a trace species on campus for 40 years. I wonder if the removal of the owl boxes was part of why the population has very very rapidly exploded

20081014 19:57:00 nbsp Davis squirrels are so cute!  I always wondered if the ground squirrel was a squirrel, I was calling them squirrelmunks, across between a chipmunk and a squirrel.

There is a red mouthed squirrel who lives in my walnut tree, that little jerk is always peeling walnuts over my doorstep and dropping them on the roof.  He also barks at me and my cats on weekends, very rude.  Is a barking vicious squirrel exhibiting symptoms of rabies, or is this normal behavior?  Squirrel fights can also be quite loud, downright ferocious.  Users/CarrieBishop

20081015 01:18:44 nbsp No worries about rabies from squirrels. The raspy barking is normal behavior. They do it when startled or feeling threatened.
According to the U.S. government CDC site: Small rodents (e.g., squirrels, hamsters, guinea pigs, gerbils, chipmunks, rats, and mice) and lagomorphs (including rabbits and hares) are almost never found to be infected with rabies and have not been known to transmit rabies to humans.

20081015 07:22:07 nbsp Squirrels in California are carriers of bubonic plague on the other hand. Users/NickSchmalenberger
  Which is very treatable with easy and full recovery with modern medicine (assuming you go to a doctor). jw

20081015 15:24:58 nbsp Yes, rodents can carry the bacteria Yersinia pestis, which is also known as bubonic plague, but it is the fleas that bite the rodents, and then bite a human that transmits it. So, you arent going to get it by being attacked by a vicious squirrel. You would have to be bitten by fleas that had bitten an infected rodent.

According to our govts CDC website: Q. Who is at risk for getting plague?
A. Outbreaks in people occur in areas where housing and sanitation conditions are poor. These outbreaks can occur in rural communities or in cities. They are usually associated with infected rats and rat fleas that live in the home.

Our area in Northern California is listed as reporting 1 case from 19701997.

20100930 18:57:41 nbsp Squirrels are just rats with bigger tails. Here in Upstate NY, at my old place the squirrels used to throw acorns at my wife and our dogs as she walked them Users/PeterBoulay

20101227 19:33:26 nbsp I think I saw a squirrel with a shaved tail on campus. I saw it near Hart Hall and Wellman, and it looked terrified. I was wondering if their was some rattailed breed or something, but I really think someone just caught the poor thing and shaved its tail. How sad. Users/Michellaneous
  They lose them as a defense mechanism when evading predators.  Well, the loss isnt the defense mechanism... its the fact that it looks like theres a big fuzzy body to grab, but all the hunter gets is a bunch of fur and a squirrel gets away (minus their tail).  They also shed them annually, however I believe local squirrels would only lose their tail during the spring molt (they generally dont lose their tail during the fall shedding).  There are also a whole slew of parasites that cause hair loss, and  while I cant speak for squirrels in specific  many other types of rodents chew off each others hair as a type of dominance (in the types of rodents Im more familiar with, its called barbering).  Its also possible you saw a different local rodent that you mistook for a squirrel.  If it looked terrified, it might be because it was flushed out into the open.  Other than squirrels, most local rodents really dont like being in the open, and tend to limit their time outside of cover. ⁓Users/JabberWokky ʝ⍵
