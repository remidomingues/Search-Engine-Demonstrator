20100427 12:56:48 nbsp Anyone have any comments about living here?  Im considering signing a lease for this fall and would love some perspective.  Thanks :) Users/marissa2112

20110521 17:27:42 nbsp I have lived here for 4 years and absolutely LOVE my apartment!!!! The place is so quiet and peaceful, and located very close to downtown Davis. The apartment is huge and I love the open set up of the kitchen/dining/living room. There is a fullsize washer and dryer which is so convenient. The landlords mom lives in one of the units and is available whenever you need anything. The rent is due the first day of the month, if you are late by even an hour you are charged a fee.

20110614 13:39:13 nbsp The contact info on their website doesnt work. And the pictures dont come up... I think that theyre website is old... does anyone know of a way to contact them by email? Or if they have a website up that is current (with current prices... their website says 2 beds are 1050) Users/KarinaSnapp

20120715 23:20:13 nbsp This is the nicest apartment I have ever had in Davis. The complex is quiet and safe, and the manager is very responsive to any problems. The apartments are big and kept in good condition. We had to leave after one year because we are moving out of the country, but we just received our security deposit back for the full amount plus interest. Not only was this a great place to live, but the management is actually honest. Users/JeffLee
