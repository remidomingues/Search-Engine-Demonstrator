St. James Catholic Church is a Roman Catholic Spiritual Organizations Church partnered with the Newman Center. They have a mass in Spanish on Sundays at 5:00 pm. If you have an interest in joining the Catholic Church contact the http://stjamesdavis.org/sj_education.php?classAdults RCIA.  They also have an elementary school, St. James Catholic School located adjacent to the church. There are both indoor and outdoor Stations of the Cross.

It is located near the Davis Branch Library.

The original Catholic Church building was built in 1875.  Archbishop Joseph S. Alemany dedicated the church to honor Saint James on June 10, 1881. It was 56x88 feet, and it had a steeple that was 75 feet tall. There was enough room for about 250 to sit. Sadly, the building burned down in 1933. It was located at the northeast corner of 3rd Street and I Street. A second church was built as a replacement, but it was relatively small, and the congregation quickly outgrew the space. It currently functions as the Newman Center.

The interior design of the current building (which was remodeled in the early 2000s) resembles a protestant or evangelical church more than a traditional Catholic one. Very bright, welcoming, and modern, unlike that mysterious, gothic stereotype of usual Catholic churches. Of course, if you are into that kind of architecture, the beautiful http://cathedralsacramento.org/ Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament in Downtown Sacramento should be up your alley.

20120720 13:57:36 nbsp I just wanted to share with the community a prayer my mother shared with me:

Holy Spirit, You who made me see everything, and showed me the way to reach my ideals; You, who gave me the divine give to forgive the wrong  that is done to me, and who are in, in all incidences of my life, with me. I, in this short dialogue , want to thank You for everything and confirm, once more, that I never want to be separated from You, no matter how great material desire may be. I want to be with You and my loved ones in Your Perpetual Glory. Amen. Thank you for you love toward me and my loved ones.

I was instructed to pray this for three days without asking for anything or intention until the 3rd day.
Enjoy.  Users/ElisaG
