St. Lukes Church has been an Episcopalian Episcopal community of spiritual organizations prayer and ministry in Woodland for over 130 years. Since 1871, the people of St. Lukes Church have striven to worship in a manner that brings glory to God. We have been blessed with a beautiful and spacious facility in which to worship, learn, enjoy fellowship and reach out to the community, the nation and the world. In 1965 we opened St. Lukes Nursery School, a preschool that has nurtured thousands of children in the communities of Yolo County.
