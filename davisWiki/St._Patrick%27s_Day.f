St. Patricks Day is ostensibly a religious holidays holiday on March 17th celebrating Saint Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland, and the arrival of Christianity in Ireland.  As celebrated in the United States, its either a cultural celebration or a alcohol boozefilled day of revelry.  Many restaurants and bars in town offer greenthemed specials.  The Graduate, for instance, has a long history of opening at 6am with green eggs and ham and green beer.
