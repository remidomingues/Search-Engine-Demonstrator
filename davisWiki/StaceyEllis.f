Hi!  Im Stacey Ellis!

Im a thirdyear graduate student in the Geography Graduate Group at UC Davis and copresident (AKA the Derwent Whittlesey Chair) of GLOBAL GLOBAL: geography club, as well as one of the organizers of the Human Geography Research Group.  This is a very long way of saying Im a bit of a nerd, but at least Im a nerd who is comfortable with it.

Im an avid traveler, when the funds allow.  Ive been to about a dozen or so European countries and love to trade travel stories (Did I ever tell you about that awesome monkey puzzle tree I found in Keswick, England?  Oh, well, check out the picture I posted here...).  When tied closer to home, I love going to concerts, watching movies, crocheting, playing on my computer, and tending to my houseplants.

My hometown is Chico (dont judge!) and Ive been very involved in the wiki:Chico Chico Wiki, so when Im not playing on the Davis Wiki, its probably because Im gnoming over there.  You should come by and check it out some time.  Surely you must know something about Chico to share!

I am the 20082009 wiki:ucdgsa GSA Public Relations Officer Public Relations Officer at the Graduate Student Association (which has somehow made me the queen of CoffeeBagelDonut Day bagels without my realizing it!) as well as an avid promoter of our wiki:ucdgsa new wiki.

And if this hasnt satisfied your curiosity for all things Staceyrelated, there is another user profile about me over at Chico Wiki.  Feel free to wiki:chico Users/StaceyEllis take a peek...

20080923 00:20:46 nbsp Are you coming to the day of coffee, bagels, and donuts on Friday? Users/IDoNotExist

20080924 14:41:29 nbsp Ich bin ein Berliner... (can a person really be a jelly donut?)  Will you be conferring at a conference of people who attend conferences to confer about contiguous conifers, corndogs, capitals, corridors, corners, corrugated cardboard, card carrying cashiers, comatose club cochairs, and Chico? Users/IDoNotExist

20081003 13:38:30 nbsp Hey, Stacey.  How about Saturday evening or Sunday after 3 at Crepeville?  That other person definitely wants to meet you.  :)  Let me know if you are free... Users/IDoNotExist

20081004 14:27:59 nbsp Ok.  Let me check with the other party (which seems to exist).  Ill get back to you about it later today.  I think that said party will probably be up for it.  :) Users/IDoNotExist

20081005 20:14:43 nbsp How about Saturday?  Sunday seems to be out... Users/IDoNotExist

20081005 20:15:53 nbsp How can you meet someone who doesnt exist? Users/StevenDaubert

20081006 01:02:43 nbsp How can you NOT meet someone who doesnt exist? Users/IDoNotExist

20081006 01:08:39 nbsp Indeed they will be!  Im not sure what time they who must not be named will be free on Saturday, but I propose that if it is not hot and generally unpleasant, that we meet at a predefined spot of existence where they sell farmers near the town of the crepes.

If you keep running into me, does that hurt?  Maybe I should install an airbag... Users/IDoNotExist

20081108 00:19:00 nbsp twas nice seeing you ephemerally today.  :) Users/IDoNotExist

20081110 10:15:41 nbsp Well, since I dont exist, you might not have noticed, but I actually DID catch you this weekend!  I was not existing with you the entire weekend.  Its not surprising that you didnt notice, since Im really not here, or there, or anywhere else.  :)

Your head exploded.  Twice.

Im sure I will get all bagelly at the appointed bagel time.  :) Users/IDoNotExist

20081112 18:20:31 nbsp Bagels are more important than Chico Wiki?  Pfft :P Users/RyanMikulovsky

20081120 00:18:17 nbsp Bagels are more important than sleep!  Bagels are even more important than food itself! Users/IDoNotExist

20081120 12:24:34 nbsp Hehehe.  I disagree...it is bagels that are more important than bagels, not the other way around!  Surely, thus must be evident!  I dont see how you could view it the other way... Users/IDoNotExist

20081120 20:19:31 nbsp Im up for that.  Oh, and if you like visiting botanical gardens during your travels, try Hershey Gardens in Pennsylvania... one of the best Ive been to anywhere, and I love botanical gardens.  They have several mother trees, and a large section just devoted to grasses. Users/JabberWokky

20081120 22:01:43 nbsp The bagels from Davis are better because they have better tasting bagel holes, and they grow on the best bagel trees! Users/IDoNotExist

20081120 22:14:13 nbsp I could not find the entire thread, even when I searched amongst the many wiki worlds.

It is my hope that some day our bagels will find a common cause, with cream cheese and toasting.  Some day, they will triumph over the donuts which threaten their holes.  Some day, they will find lox and love (is there not love in lox?).  Some day, there will be chain of bagels linked through their holes.  Davis bagels and Chico bagels united as one.

We can all dream, cant we? Users/IDoNotExist

20081121 14:07:18 nbsp Mmmm ... bagels. Users/condemned2bfree

20081121 16:13:12 nbsp Bagels make the world toroidal! Users/IDoNotExist

20081121 17:36:40 nbsp Bagels make the world want jam and butter... Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20081121 19:22:19 nbsp Oddly, I was just going to get a dinner including a bagel.  This must be an attempt at mind control by the better bagel bakers of Brooklyn.  This is part of their evil plot to take over all bagel holes in the world, and merge them into a giant bagel black hole. Users/IDoNotExist

20081121 19:23:25 nbsp Youre right.  That wasnt subtle.  No, not that.  That.  The subtle thing that we were discussing previously that wasnt so subtle after all. Users/IDoNotExist

20081122 23:16:57 nbsp There is a dopplestacey! Users/IDoNotExist

20090111 23:46:41 nbsp Wow!  A Stacey at a Wiki gathering!  I must say that I will be amazed to see this... Users/IDoNotExist

20090306 19:35:54 nbsp Excellent StaceyGuess! Users/IDoNotExist

20090320 23:56:11 nbsp Geology, not Geography?  I thought you and the other you were both Geography? Users/IDoNotExist

20090408 15:53:41 nbsp No gold stars for you! Users/RyanMikulovsky

20090608 12:11:21 nbsp Hey Stacey, I had a few questions about CoffeeBagelDonut Day.  How many weeks per year is it run? And can you tell me or email me a little bit of info about the budgeting aspects? Im hoping to push the UCLA GSA to put on a similar event. It seems the GSA down here isnt really as active as it was in Davis (so far, all weve seen is a yearly welcome dinner to the new students, and a few graduate student dances at fancy LA clubs, thats cohosted/rented by USC and LMU GSAs). I think most of us would rather have the pizza once a month and free coffee/bagels once a week by far!   Users/EdWins
