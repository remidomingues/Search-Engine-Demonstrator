Standing Wave is a Town Art sculpture spanning nearly 40 feet wide by up to 12 feet high.  The piece is composed of an array of 180 vertical poles arranged into three rows set in concrete along Second Street in front of Explorit Science Center Explorits main site. You cant just view it from just there to get the whole experience... There are things only visible from the highway, and from the perspective of train riders, people in the second story of the building, and also kids (ie low to ground), etc.




  Standing Wave shows that the disciplines of both art and science share many common traits. In this piece, I tried to bring the relationships between perception and recognition, interpretation and understanding, as well as work and play, to the forefront.  Chris Daubert
