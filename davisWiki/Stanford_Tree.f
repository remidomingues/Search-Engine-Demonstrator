A Town Flora tree (with a dude inside) who represents wiki:WikiPedia:Stanford_University Stanford University who goes to other California College campuses to rile up the students.

Some Davis freshman freshmen ran around with their own homemade Stanford tree to advertise for the Davis vs. Stanford football game on Sept. 17, 2005  which UC Davis won 2017.

 A Troubled Tree 

On February 9, 2006 Erin Lashnits, the Stanford Tree mascot, was found to have a 0.157 bloodalcohol content during a mens basketball game.  As the Stanford Marching Band was on alcohol suspension, and the tree is considered a part of the band, she was quickly relieved of her treewearing duties to avoid disciplinary action against the whole organization.

Then, on March 20, 2006 the replacement tree was ejected from the game not leaving the court at halftime in a timely manner, according to http://sports.espn.go.com/ncw/recap?gameId264000041 this article.


20050727 00:28:41 nbsp Oh man during Picnic Day, I was heading to go play with the Banduh (I had work that day) and brought a crapload of muffins and bagels to feed the Clarinet section, and the tree thing saw it and tried to jump me for it. My black apron, however, was too much for it. Users/AndreHarris

20050922 18:39:42 nbsp Oh man  Users/JacobRoche beat that thing up once. Ask him about it sometime Users/GeoffJohnson

20050922 21:02:23 nbsp Arnt they the cardinals? Users/CarlosOverstreet

20050922 23:45:39 nbsp The tree was in my dorm building last May and it weirded a couple people out. I recognized the tree but it took me a while to remember about the game that was months away. Anyway, about the name: their sports teams are named the Cardinal after the red color of their logo. They used to be called the Indians from 1930 until 1972, after receiving insensitivity complaints from Native American students. Users/TomLangston

20050923 09:29:23 nbsp The tree is their bands mascot, but it unofficially represents the whole school (kind of like how were aggies, but our sports teams are the mustangs).  Users/MonikaLin

20051227 22:59:20 nbsp Well ACTUALLY... The tree is El Palo Alto (The Tall Tree), the namesake and symbol of the city of Palo Alto, where Stanford is located. Stanfords mascot USED to be the Indian head, but in the 1970s was changed to the more neutral Cardinal. Users/SteveDavison

20060321 10:00:52 nbsp i thought cardinal was one of the schools colors? im pretty sure their mascot has always been that tree. Users/EmilyTung

20060504 10:32:00 nbsp hey everybody! i dont go to stanford but got a presentation on the school so does anyone happen to know what the students there call the tree?  Users/AmandaStone

20060504 12:05:00 nbsp Clarification: The teams are the Cardinal (as in the color, not the bird).  Their mascot is the tree.  Kinda like how our teams are the Aggies, but we are represented by the Mustang. Users/AllisonEriksen
