20110101 15:45:11 nbsp I recently had an issue with a water heater and a leaking sink in an apartment on J st. my mother is renting that is owned by StarCrossed Properties. After reporting both problems to her landlord, Tom, he made a sameday visit to inspect the problems. The water heater required new parts and Tom drove to Sacramento on New Years Eve to obtain a replacement. The next morning on New Years Day, Tom came by to make sure our water heater was working OK and to measure our leaky sink so that he could find an appropriate replacement.

I found Tom to be extremely efficient and understanding, while maintaining a friendly demeanor. I was especially moved by the fact that Tom made such effort on a major Holiday, which isnt always the case with other property managers. Users/RemiKruk

20110917 11:13:04 nbsp Starcrossed/Tom Cross has been my landlord now for about six months.  In that time Ive had two quite disruptive problems with the apartment.  Tom acted quickly and I think probably at considerable expense to solve both of them.  His whole approach both times was terrificprofessional, open, and caring, even on one occasion when I was stressed out and acting a bit like an idiot.  Highly recommendedthis is a great landlord.  By the way the complex, Alvarado Parkside, is a great place to live.   Users/EdwardRoss
