20120120 17:02:05 nbsp Hi John, I see in one of your pictures you have Tux sitting on top of a cabinet.  Did you by any chance win that at the LUGOD 13th anniversary meeting?  Your office setup looks really nice.  Best of luck to you. Users/aroach12

  Hi aroach12, yes, I http://www.lugod.org/photos/2012.01.16/IMAG2270t.jpg won that Tux at the LUGOD anniversary. I was there for the first time and really liked it. Thanks for the compliment! Users/JeroenPost

20120625 08:43:52 nbsp John is a friendly, patient computer expert.  He spent nearly an hour diagnosing the problem with my laptop, taking it apart AND putting it perfectly back together, and didnt want to charge me.  Great service, super friendly person.  The rates that he gives are very reasonable, and I wouldnt hesitate to go back to John for any future problems.   Users/jimhu

20120625 21:26:59 nbsp I highly recommend John Post, as a very profesional and skilled computer technician. He fixed my 5 years old computer.  First I asked for advice if I need to buy a brand new computer because it was very slow and it gaves me wrong information all the time. He said I can make it brand new.  I was surprised when he said that.  He saved me a lot of money from having to buy a new computer.  Mirasol from next door. Users/MirasolHill

20120929 15:19:25 nbsp I spilled a pint of root beer on my laptop at 6:00 on Friday four days before my dissertation was due and John had my computer working by 1:00 the next day. His prices are reasonable too. He also looked at an old computer of mine to see if he could fix it and because he couldnt he didnt charge me. I would definitely go back to him. Users/LauraFeinstein
