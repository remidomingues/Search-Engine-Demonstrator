20110819 13:05:47 nbsp Update: theyre doing a test opening today, handing out free banh mi sandwiches and rice bowls.  Real opening is 8/22/11, I think? Users/ToddGreen

20110826 15:42:31 nbsp A Vietnamese sandwich for six bucks is a little much, especially since you get a small one with very little meat. Quality was similar to that of Sunrises on a mediocre day. Would only eat here if I am feeling really lazy. Users/hankim

20110829 12:21:40 nbsp Thai tea was good, everything else was just way too expensive for the quality. My friends chicken dish was even a little undercooked, and my chicken green curry was bland. They might have been rushing on opening day, but serving chewy pinkish chicken breast is a bit disconcerting. Try Sunrise for a more reasonable and tasty banh mi, and Thai Nakorn for far superior curry. Users/DavisFoodie

20110830 12:59:59 nbsp Definitely be careful ordering their meat dishes. I second DavisFoodies contention that their chicken breast is undercooked. My Thai BBQ chicken was also chewy and pinkish (threw it away after a few bites). Dont know how they can undercook the breast when it is super thin, but they manage to do so. Users/DGriffi

20110922 17:39:20 nbsp A thai/viet truck on campus!? How disappointed I am to see the prices and read about the quality. Looks like Im still gonna have to make that schlep to Sunrise.  Also surprised noodleless menu.   Users/AndyChuck

20110927 19:54:23 nbsp The chicken is actually a thigh not breast.  Which can often account for the color in the thigh. Users/trixar
