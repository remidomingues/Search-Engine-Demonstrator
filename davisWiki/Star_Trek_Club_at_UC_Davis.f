The Star Trek Club at UC Davis is a student organizations student organization whose continuing mission is to watch Star Trek, discuss Star Trek, and have fun! We also work to promote values such as critical thinking, exploring the unknown, and humanitarianism.  The club was founded by Rachel Pevsner in 2010 after she and several classmates enjoyed a UC Davis seminar that studied the Star Trek series, its social, racial, economic, and gender commentaries, and its impact on real life technology and social issues.

We recommend following the facebook page or joining the email listserv (by emailing us) in order to stay up to date with club activities.

Meetings

Meetings are once a week for one hour. The general meeting features general project announcements, watching clips from Star Trek, and a discussion question to begin conversation.

Membership

We accept everyone and are especially fond of new members and new ideas! We are predominantly composed of UC Davis undergraduates, but graduate students and community members who are interested are encouraged to check us out, as our meetings are considered open to the public.
