Starbucks is an omnipresent coffeehouse chain based in Seattle, WA. There are eight locations in Davis.  There are three fullsized Corporate Starbucks and five Licensed Starbucks. The licensed Starbucks cafes include Safeway, Target, the Silo, and the Arc. The Scrubs Cafe is a Sodexo Cafe but serves Starbucks through a food service contract. For other coffee places in Davis, see Cafes.

Unlimited free WiFi is now offered by Starbucks at their corporate run stores as of July 1, 2010. You can tell the difference between licensed Starbucks stores and corporate run Starbucks stores due to the fact that corporate Starbucks stores provide free WiFi through the Starbucks WiFi network. Licensed locations may offer their own WiFi, but it is not through the Starbucks network.

If you get a Reusable Gift Cards Starbucks Gift Card and register it online at their website, you will get free refills on brewed or ice coffee or tea during the same store visit. In addition, you earn points for free drinks or food when you use that card at Starbucks.  You can also get a free drink for your birthday. Registering your card online protects the value on the card in case the card is lost or stolen. Most grocery store and Target Starbucks now accept the Starbucks gift card.

Also, Starbucks may send you an email and notify you that they have added an extra $5.00 on to your card for being a loyal member. The free $5.00 reward is chosen by computer and is completely random.

A few years ago, the media reported that Starbucks closed 600 stores http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25482250/. None of the stores in Davis were on the closure list. All of the stores in Davis remained open: http://www.starbucks.com/aboutus/USStoreClosureInfo.pdf PDF file listing store closureshttp://money.cnn.com/news/specials/storysupplement/starbucks_closings/CA.html Interactive map with store closings by state.


On Earth Day Friday April 22, 2011 Starbucks gave away free brewed coffee and tea if you brought in a reusable cup.  Starbucks celebrated 40 years in 2011.

http://news.starbucks.com/article_display.cfm?article_id502 March 8th10th, Starbucks is showing us their new branding, dedicating themselves to local communities like ours and is giving away free treats whenever we buy our regular cupojoe or whatever else we might be drinking.


 Fullsized Starbucks (Corporate Stores)
One is in Central Davis, in the University Mall.  Its the closest coffee to the Cuarto dorms.  This means that if youre a Freshman in those dorms youll probably head over there a lot.  The place is usually really packed, and everyone studies there. Note: Large groups arriving near closing will cause difficulties for many of the employees (most of whom are students), though it is their job to serve, they probably will not be the happiest campers at this hour.  Starbucks is a rather popular place, however many people find that Old Teahouse is a better place for chatting and hanging out.

The second is Downtown on F Street.  Its got less studying going on, but thats mainly because most of the seats are outside.

The third Starbucks features a DriveThru and is near the Sutter Hospital in West Davis. Although this location used to get packed out pretty quickly on weekends, in Fall of 2010 the store expanded into the adjacent unit (formerly occupied by a Dominos), effectively doubling its seating capacity.  The upgrade incorporated more outlets as well, making this location much nicer for studying.  The parking lot is still limited (it was always a problem), though some of the spaces have also been converted to 10 minute spaces.

 Licensed Starbucks 
A Licensed Starbucks is located in South Davis and North Davis Safeway. One could argue that it is not, in fact, a true Starbucks but they would be wrong. It does feature an employee in a genuine Starbucks uniform serving genuine Starbucks beverages. Food is provided by Starbucks. However, as it is a mere supermarket booth kiosk contraption, seating is limited. There is a bar at the window nearby in the South Davis Safeway Starbucks, but I wouldnt call the experience pleasant. This is the Starbucks one might utilize if one finds oneself in the South Davis Safeway with a strong craving for coffee.

The Starbucks workers inside of Safeway are actually Safeway employees trained by Starbucks (and sometimes/always work exclusively at the coffee bar.)  However, because they are Safeway employees they receive union benefits such as occasional time off. Then again, baristas at the corporate stores receive decent pay (better than the employees working at the Safeway kiosks) and a healthy benefits package, including paid vacation hours accumulated based on hours worked.

Another Licensed Starbucks is located at the ARC and opened February 24th, 2009. It replaced what used to be the ARCs Center Court Cafe. It is run by Sodexo and has different prices than a Corporate Starbucks store. Brenans Starbucks is also a licensed location that is staffed by Sodexo employees. It became a full service licensed Starbucks in 2011 after completing renovations. Previously, Brenans simply served Starbucks drinks, but did not offer a full menu of Starbucks foods.

A new licensed Starbucks staffed by Starbucks trained Target employees is inside of the new Davis Target store. No WiFi.

 Unlicensed Starbucks 
Scrubs Scrubs Cafe is an unlicensed location but serves Starbucks drinks through a food service contract. This location does not get their food from Starbucks, but is supplied freshly baked items from Sodexo.

Brenans Starbucks at the Silo used to be unlicensed until renovations of the Silo in 2011.

 Alternative Orders 
Starbucks offers an 8 oz., or short version of its hot drinks, for about 30 cents less than the 12 oz. tall versions. Sometimes, this is the better deal  for example, you get a more concentrated cappuccino, since you lose 4 oz. of frothy milk. This size is not advertised yet is featured for drinks such as the Kids Hot Chocolate, Espresso Con Panna, and Espresso Macchiato.

Vegan options include soy lattes and Frappuccino Juice Blends, as well as the offmenu Blended Strawberry Lemonade.

 Starbucks Criticism 
Starbucks business practices have caused a great deal of ire in a notsosmall segment of the population.  Such sentiments are voiced in websites such as http://www.starbucked.com/ Starbucked.com. Starbucked stickers can be found stuck in various places around Davis (photo request). Even some critics, however, disregard http://www.starbucked.com/ Starbucked.com for a perceived shrill and eccentric tone.  AntiStarbucks sentiments are also held by some involved in the local Slow Food slow food movement. Starbucks spends more money on health care for its employees in a year than they spend on coffee. Starbucks provides their employees with health care, free drinks, and other benefits. The founder of Starbucks believes in providing good benefits for his employees even if it reduces the overall profit of the company.

Starbucks has drawn the anger of antisweatshop activists, who attack Starbucks use of cheap, maltreated labor in poor Latin American countries.
Starbucks has enforced policies called http://www.scscertified.com/csrpurchasing/starbucks.html C.A.F.E. (Coffee and Farmer Equity) Practices that delve into the social and economic status of its farming regions to help improve life for the farm employees (in even charitable ways such as sharing costs of building hospitals and hiring onsite doctors for farm workers and their families) as well as maintaining the quality of the coffee produced on these farms.

According to Global Exchange, Starbucks buys over 100 million pounds of coffee each year, yet less than 1% is purchased from coffee farmers who are guaranteed a living wage.

20060123 05:13:00 nbsp The music at the University Mall location is annoyingly loud. I wonder if they do that on purpose to drive people away? Users/ApolloStumpy
In my opinion music in almost every venue is annoyingly loud.  I dont find Starbucks generally to be that bad an offender in this case.  If they are trying to drive students away they should stick to straight up classical anyway, that has been shown to chase away teens in many venues. Users/rocksanddirt
  Classical SUCKS! Users/AndrewBanta douche bag

I know its againstthegrain to say so, but I have always had positive experiences with Starbucks, both in Davis and elsewhere. They have always been gratious hosts; I have never felt unwelcome or pressured to leave, or had to ask for restroom keys, or such. I especially wish to thank the University Mall Starbucks. YMMV. Users/SteveDavison

The only bad experience I had is one time when I really needed to go to the bathroom.  I went in, and an employee knocked as soon as I went in.  Instead of just finishing, I opened the door.  She said to get out, then said something snide.  Was there a sign in front?  Yes.  Was the floor wet, and was anyone doing anything?  No.  Should I have poured my coffee on the bathroom floor in protest?  Yes.  I didnt.  It was probably within their right (and I suppose the employee was more annoying than the chain in this case), but I feel better after telling that story.  Thanks.Users/MisterProfessor

Arent all laborers in LatinAmerican countries maltreated?  Infact arent all workers outside the United States maltreated in our eyes?  What about our own practices of child labor prior to World War I?  Isnt it all relative?  Poor working conditions in our eyes may be glorious compared to how foreign powers treat their peoples.  And is that really any of our business?  Should we convert them to our capitalistic, superior ways? Users/AndrewBanta
  It would appear that it is our own capitalistic, superior ways that are treating the workers in LatinAmerican countries and so many others poorly.  Its not about converting others, its about improving our own businesses methods.  Perhaps working conditions have improved within our border, but I would venture to say that the way WE treat labor has NOT improved overall, for a huge number of those factories treating their labor so poorly are OURS.  For this reason, American businesses like Starbucks are being indicted.  Perhaps the fact that they are our businesses make it our business.  Users/BobbyGray

20060328 22:51:21 nbsp I order shorts all the time and rarely get funny looks, unless they are new and dont know what a short is. And they always call my drink. That is just silly. Users/KarenaAslanian
   Why is that silly? Users/AndrewBanta Drew
         Its silly to say they look at you like youre crazy if you order a short and wont call your drink, as someone did in the above article. They are perfectly fine with people ordering a short, even though its a bit unusual.  KA

20060330 22:26:08 nbsp A barista attacked me at this particular location.  Not that anyone could blame him.  However, attack may not be as precise a word as one would hope.  He hurled a latte at me.  Now when I say hurled what I mean to say is I picked it up and the lid shattered into oblivion and I was doused in 160 degree chi.  Just ask Users/JohnDudek DudeK, or Users/MichelleAccurso Mike. Users/AndrewBanta

20060403 02:18:58 nbsp The starbucks at the UMall has replaced Mishkas as my favorite cafe in Davis, making this a sad sad day in my life. Sorry Mishkas, youd be fantastic if you also werent so goddamn frustrating. Users/JesseSingh

20060403 02:22:38 nbsp Starbucks would be many times more enjoyable if they served things on plates and in glass cups instead of bags and paper cups. Users/BrianAng
   I absolutely concur with that. Users/JesseSingh
   Actually as you place your order you may request porcelain plates and/or cups.  I suggest that you ask to have the cup warmed up (by having them run hot water in it, than dumping it out) otherwise your coffee will heat up the cup, and cool itself down, iced/blended drinks may also be placed in glass cups.  Save the environment!  They will also provide you with a metal fork or spoon if requested.  However, curiously enough metal knives have yet to be invented in the world of Starbucks. Users/AndrewBanta
    Why is it that they dont have 20 oz. (Venti) reusable cups?  All of the travel coffee cups to buy and reuse are 16 oz...  Users/DavidGrundler

20060405 13:06:03 nbsp Generally speaking Ive had good experiences at both the UMall and Downtown locations. The Downtown Starbucks more commonly has a selection of a fruit and cheese platter that I like, but theres hardly any seating. I like to go early in the morning (like 6 AM) to get an orange juice and read the Times. The only negative experience Ive had is sitting next to a couple of patrons; this old woman was being very loud and rude to her husband ... but Starbucks really has no control over these things. SS

20060405 15:19:32 nbsp Why does everyone love to hate Starbucks so much? They pay their own workers better than what a lot of small coffee spots do, theyre clean, the quality is almost always pretty high, they try to stock things like organic and fairtrade coffees. It seems like people just love to hate the big guy, no matter how good the big guy actually is. Ive never had anything but good experiences at the Davis Starbucks locations, and theyre also one of the few coffee places in town where my friend in a motorized wheelchair doesnt have to get out of her car (and unload the chair, etc) to get coffee in the mornings (at the drivethrough location). Users/EricKlein

20070222 12:45:19 nbsp I like Starbucks. Unlike some other coffee stops, you always know what youre going to get. The downtown location is incredibly small, however. They need to take over that bagel place. Users/BriannaBetancourt

20070222 20:03:40 nbsp Of course you know what to expect: bad coffee...  The first thing to try when judging any coffee shops espresso drinks is straight espresso...  If its not good, make sure you order something with a LOT of milk to cover the taste. Users/WesHardaker

20070326 17:14:44 nbsp After sleepily leaving the radio station at 6am following my KDVS show, Id often enjoy lounging in their (umall branch) cushioned chairs, make a vain attempt at studying, and drinking a drink of some sort. I was glad to have the place to go to. Users/JosephBleckman

20070529 17:20:44 nbsp I know no one cares but F st (downtown) Starbucks is getting a remodel. Its going to become pretty and will soon be selling breakfast sandwiches. The store is almost 20 years old and is getting amuch needed makeover.  Users/EvandeBie

20080224 20:16:40 nbsp It is impossible to study at the University Mall Starbucks.  Its even impossible to chat with friends.  The reason is the annoyingly loud music! Worse still, the baristas change the music every 2 minutes, midsong. The effect of their music changing is that you cant concentrate on anything. Even if youve finally adapted and become able to tune out 1 annoying, loud song, they put on another annoying song by a different pop act thats freshly irritating.  The coffee servers  but thats something for their manager to deal with. Unless you enjoy being blasted with teenpop music, teen boy band music, stuff that sounds like Britney Spears, really bad Nashville country music, etc. STAY AWAY! Users/StevenBaughmeister

20080228 20:15:47 nbsp I really like the employees at the UMall Starbucks. While I found the music annoyingly loud when I am trying to study, the employees are generally attentive and fast. Users/Kiran

20080318 13:46:40 nbsp While I too find loud music in coffee shops annoying, I do want to differ with why this is. For me a coffee shop is a place to go with people and talk, to exchange ideas. Studying can surely be a part of the experience too, but its a coffee shop not a study hall. Espresso machines are loud, as are blenders and baristas calling out orders. So the place is not going to be a serene bastion of people with their noses in their books or laptops. Loud music is disruptive to the ideal atmosphere a coffee shop can offer. This seems very pertinent given the companys newfound focus back on their coffee and service. Users/AnthonySoto

20080321 22:47:55 nbsp At some Starbucks locations, they ask you for your name so that they can call your drink when it is ready. Do you make up a name or do you use your regular name? Whats your Starbucks nickname? Some of my favorites are: Marco(half the store replies with Polo), Bobert, and Rover.

20080321 23:49:52 nbsp I like Starbucks because all the employees (at least on F Street) are properly trained and know how to make good drinks. I would like to support local shops like Ciocolat over Starbucks, but the inconsistency of those workers lead me to Starbucks, where I know Ill get a nicely prepared drink. Thank you! :) Users/davistudent

20080327 22:40:02 nbsp Starbucks is good.  I dont feel their coffee is as strong as other places, such as Peet;s.  I like that they have a Skinny Latte and  you can ask them to make a skinny version of other drinks, like their mochas.   Users/CurlyGirl26

OK, but, alas, no complaining as Starbucks is tasty and reliably there.  Good choices.   When I am in So. Davis Safeway, Id rather go to Common Grounds for the XTreme Frappe (yum) + chocolate dipped macaroons (yum yum).  Common Grounds was there first anyways, and has been one of the best pioneering free wifi cafes in Davis. Users/JasonBundy

20080830 08:00:27 nbsp Starbucks is high quantity of LOW QUALITY coffee. Their socalled Pikes Place blend is susposed to be the best coffee theyre ever had. You know what I think? .....YUCK.

The only think good about starbucks is that their on just about every corner in the Nation and they are consistently mediocre.

What I drink there... Venti, iced, 3pump, iced white mocha with no whip cream. And, if they have something else becides Pikes Place for drip coffee, ill get that. Their Gold Coast is pretty good.

For good coffee try PEETS. I dont know if this is true, but my friend told me when Starbucks started out, they bought their beans from Peets Roasters. True? Users/j.davis

20080913 08:00:00 nbsp I live a block away from the Starbucks in Central Davis. I would not like this Starbucks to go away because I want a quick coffee some times. But I definitely had a bad experience with a cashier once. So far I have went to this Starbucks about five times. There were not a lot of customers on that day, so I cannot imagine he was acting out of frustration. The person in front was asking the cashier how to order coffee. He acted nice towards HER, but when it was my turn, and I was right behind her, he took out a personal vendetta on me. You see, I simply said a double tall latte which would typically give you a hot latte. He asked me if I wanted hot or cold latte. Before I could say hot, he explained that he had never heard of a cold latte before, so why should I even think about choosing. But when I said a double tall latte, I meant a hot latte. I felt I was unfairly discriminated against because of his condescending attitude towards me when I was not the person that he should get annoyed with. Users/WengFF

20080916 18:36:31 nbsp Seems like the guy was trying to be nice and strike some conversation but it wasnt done properly. Him asking you hot or cold is normal for coffee drinks because I work at a coffee place myself. But to make the comment after asking you was kinda unnecessary. Users/ThUn

20081007 22:07:04 nbsp I made this account just to be able to say: the employees at the downtown starbucks threw trash on my car.  I was parked in the back alley and the uncoordinated people that work there seem to have no ability to get trash in the actual bin until it has been smeared all over my vehicle.  When I went inside to protest, they all scurried from me like I am some kind of zombie monster.  I am actually a reasonably nice person, but there is absolutely no way that either the person responsible or any other person leaving from their back door would not notice that the drivers side of my car was covered in coffee grounds and smelling like vomit.  Needless to say, Im upset.    Users/stinkbot

20081015 23:51:31 nbsp I dont know about you guys but I find the Central Davis Location (MU) very unsanitary.
I went there three times in the mornings to read my textbook before class but there were like 1015 flies that were crawling all over the tables on all three days. They crawl on me sometimes and other people too. I even saw a pair of flies mating on the table! Eck!
I dont know why they dont even try to kill the flies in the rather small starbucks. Dont they care about sanity??
I really want to bring my bug spray and kill those freakin annoying flies..
I killed one with a napkin while it was sitting on a window.. It is just plain nasty..
And oh yeah.. on all three days, they were playing the same music over and over.. An album by the group Stars.. It gets alittle annoying after 3 listens to the same album..

20090228 07:26:29 nbsp Starbucks brews a decent cup of  coffee if people have any problems with the recipes and products thy should contact corporate. And as far as rude partners and wrong drinks a simple and nice please and thank you goes a long way! Most of the employees at my store are full time UCD or recent graduates of UCD.

20090319 18:56:58 nbsp CAUTION  PRICE DISCREPANCIES! I went to the Arc Starbucks for the first time today. A caramel macchiato costs $3.10 at EVERY Starbucks in  Davis. Also at the one in Arc (as it proudly states on the menu). At EVERY Starbucks in Davis, buying 2 of these costs $6.20 and that is the final price you pay. NOT AT THE ARC STARBUCKS! Here, 2 of these costs $6.65. The Arc Starbucks, uniquely, has decided to fleece you by adding the tax in afterwards. What a wonderful way to treat the student body on which it relies!
 Users/Mazzle
  The ARC Starbucks is run by Sodexo. It is not a Corporate Starbucks store. Sodexo is responsible for the price gouging. The difference between a Corporate Starbucks store and a Licensed Store is that the Corporate store has consistent pricing and Starbucks WiFi. Corporate stores are staffed by trained employees paid by Starbucks. Licensed Stores do not have WiFi and make their own prices. The ARC Starbucks is staffed by Sodexo workers instead of Starbucks employees. Users/MaxLucas


  Good points. Corporate Starbucks stores elsewhere in Davis and the ARC Starbucks all proudly display identical menu prices for all their beverages and food items. The checkout totals are, however, rather different because Sodexo chooses to subsequently apply sales tax whereas corporate Starbucks stores do not. The fact that this is not made clear by Sodexo is sneaky at best and downright deceptive at worst. Users/Mazzle


  Just like to point out, if you use your student ID for payment, they do not charge you sales tax. In addition, using the special Aggie Cash gets you an additional 10% off after not being charged sales tax. So just set up your aggie cash account linked to your credit card. Im not a Sodexhoe, but it actually saves you money!  Users/mperkel

20090319 23:16:42 nbsp The 80/80 rule: if the business receives more than 80 percent of its gross receipts from sales of food products and more than 80 percent of those sales are of taxable products, then they will charge sales tax on your coffee. If most of their sales are eaten on site, rather than to go, those sales are taxable. If they sell a lot of snack products, those are taxable. Most businesses will err on the side of charging the sales tax if there is any question, because the State Board of Equalization will usually come down on the side of making them pay the tax if there is any question. I dont know what proportion of sales at the Sodexo Starbucks are consumed on site or otherwise taxable, but I suspect the management is avoiding penalties by means of a blanket policy. Users/DonShor

20090415 12:13:09 nbsp Ive been to all the Starbucks (Starbii?) listed above and can honestly say the West Davis one is like another store entirely. Service, food and coffee quality is head and shoulders above any of the others. Users/condemned2bfree

20090415 19:56:23 nbsp I LOVE the Starbucks in West Davis (The one near the freeway). The environment is nice and the staff is really friendly, especially in the afternoon. The nice thing about this Starbucks is that there is a drivethru (which is the best idea when I want to study in the store and not be constantly disturbed by opening and closing doors). Actually... dont come here because I dont want it to be a new hangout place for noisy people when I study. Users/greencohort

20100212 14:15:20 nbsp Two weeks ago they were out of pumpkin scones. Last week a water pipe broke and they couldnt serve coffee. Today they were out of Splenda! What is this world coming too? Oh well, whaddha gonna do? I heart the Bucks! Users/103
  Pumpkin scones are seasonal Id think? Borders Seattle Best Coffee had a pipe clog last month too and out of coffee for an entire day. It could happen anywhere. Users/LeeY

20100402 18:51:11 nbsp The UMall Starbucks really made me upset today. They advertise their Starbucks card with free refills on brewed coffee. Everywhere else you get a free refill on a Caffe Misto, but UMall tells you: Our local policy is to not give out refills on a misto. This is how you get rid of a regular costumer. Of course, their menu does advertise the opposite. UMall Starbucks, you dont care about customer service, I guess. Users/AmericanSweetheart

20101204 19:21:49 nbsp It is unthinkable to me that the only legitimate coffee places north of campus closes at 9 or 10 PM. Old Teahouse and Ohana can (somehow) stay packed past midnight and their food/drink (if you can call powder mix+water and fried rat meat that) is awful. Why UMall Starbucks, why do you not want money? The ARC Starbucks the only one that isnt totally insane. Users/OrofinJackson

20101221 13:38:19 nbsp Just went to West Davis location and had a GREAT experience...I asked if they could put the breakfast sandwich off the english muffin and onto an asiago bagel, which he did and put the whole thing in the oven, it was DELICIOUS. since I had three gift cards i was wondering if they could consolidate them and he READ MY MIND and offered to do so..in addition the whole place was remodeled and immaculate.  all in all, the best Starbucks experience Ive ever had:) Highly recommend a visit and hopefully you will get helped by this employee...male in late thrities/forties ~6ft tall Users/GreezySweezy

20110531 14:16:18 nbsp The staff at all the Starbucks stores around town are great  But my favorite is the downtown Starbucks crew! They are professional, courteous, fun and make a fantastic latte.  They always make me feel welcomed back each time I go in  And they make an effort to always call their regular customers by name.   Users/TillSey

20110531 17:05:41 nbsp I am truly a fan of the Downtown Starbucks, the staff is honestly really great.

20110711 11:44:34 nbsp I have been a loyal customer to Starbucks for MANY years.  The prices that they charge for coffee amongst other things are high, so I expect to get a great quality drink/product/service.  Now, the one in West Davis (particularly the drive through) they make some disgusting drinks...not even worth drinking!  I just ordered a peppermint hot chocolate and it was so gross! And most of the time the employees are not that graceful either.  I have been to all of them and I like the one on F Street the best...hands down! They seem to be a little more professional and about 98% of the time their drinks taste good to me.   Users/YourMama

20111124 08:50:50 nbsp The downtown location is probably my favorite Starbucks EVER. I go in there almost every day and consistently get an awesome drink (and some awesome customer service) not matter who is making drinks that day. Someone here knows how to train people to make lattes! Users/ShaunaStewart

20120305 19:53:42 nbsp The F. Street location, and the one I frequent most, has now been remodeled into the dingiest, most depressing establishment I have witnessed in this fair city. The remodel which just took place March 1st3rd was, in my opinion the worst ever done for this company. I have since greatly reduced my visits. As much as I enjoy the brief interactions with most of the staff here (quite frankly, the only reason I would visit to begin with), the atmosphere is now entirely unappealing and outright dismal.

20120409 22:55:50 nbsp Awesome staff at the downtown starbucks location! Always friendly and they provide very quick service. Starbucks is great because compared to other places in town, my lattes simply taste good  not a burnt taste from other places. Really happy to be working near this location because the staff is just so friendly. Always gets my day going! Shout out to Sabrina, Travis and the rest of the guys and girls! Users/MelannieLavarias

20120617 09:18:40 nbsp The downtown Starbucks is absolutely a hit or miss!! It depends on who is working... I went to the downtown location the  other day to order a drink that university mall taught me how to order . I was given so much attitude by a very heavy set man with black thick framed glasses and who was dripping sweat and wiping it off with his shoulder sleeves right in front of me at the register!!!!!! I told him was I wanted and the total came out to be $1.25 more than I usually pay (and I am an avid coffee drinker so I know how much its supposed to be). I then asked  did you charge me extra? he said NO! I couldnt believe he had lied to my face!!! So of course I saved my receipt. I took it to the Starbucks that I know can be trusted (university mall) and showed them my receipt. They immediately told me that I was charged extra!! Which confirms his lie!! I have never been more irritated with an employee of a local business.. Its just baffling. Corporate will be hearing from me.  Users/mrskanaan

20130716 14:49:59 nbsp The employees at the Starbucks in West Davis are super nice. However, sometimes they are a little too loud when talking to each other. Also, cut out the country music please!  Users/AlexLee2

20140209 22:04:22 nbsp Starbucks is overpriced sometimes, such as the refreshers. A tall is almost four dollars! Its basically juice, anyways. But I really like the hot chocolate and the double choclatety chip! Users/YoungResident
