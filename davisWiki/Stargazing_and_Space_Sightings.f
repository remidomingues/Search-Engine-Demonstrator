Orbiting Space Shuttles and the International Space Station are occasionally visible from Davis (Also comets on occasion).  Another awesome thing to look for is Iridium flares!  Davis is particularly fortunate to have low levels of Light Ordinance light pollution, especially away from the campus and downtown, which makes spotting spacecraft easier.  You can find a list of upcoming Space Shuttle and ISS observation times and locations for Davis at http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/sightings/cities/view.cgi?countryUnited_States&regionCalifornia&cityDavis NASAs Human Space Flight page or you can just tell heavensabove.com where you are on the globe and they will tell you when and where in the sky and at what intensity EVERYTHING man made will be seen from your current location

One way to find a good spot for stargazing is to drive south on Mace Boulevard into the outskirts country roads.  Sacramento will light up the eastern horizon and Davis is to the north, but youll have good visibility for spotting dim objects in the majority of the sky. Another is the Gazebo in the arboretum, and another is in North D, but you have to crouch a bit into the toilet bowl to kill some of the ambient light.


Past Events
May 20th, 2012

Davis experienced a May 20, 2012 Eclipse near total eclipse.  This event was extra interesting because the moon was toward the far end of its elliptical orbit, creating a ringoffire effect as it passed in front of the sun.  The sky also got pretty dark, a few cats ran away, and some residents briefly stopped recycling.  It was awesome!

 June 5, 2012 

Davisites were witnesses to a June 5, 2012 Transit of Venus Transit of Venus.  One could see the planet Venus passing in front of the sun.  Perhaps not as cool as the eclipse, but still pretty darn cool!
