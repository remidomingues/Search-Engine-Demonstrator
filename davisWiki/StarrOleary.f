I havent updated this page in a very long time. For some reason I am now.


For an English major, your page is very confusing.  Users/JackHaskel

Looks can be deceiving. Makes sense to me. Users/StarrOleary

Youre just not used to a stream of consciousness writing style, Jack, much like most normal people. Users/BrentLaabs

Maybe we all just stream with a different style of encoding.  Users/MarieHuynh

Heck, for me, I have a 23bit word size, so no one else ever understands me.  Users/BrentLaabs

What the hell are all these people doing in my head?! I dont understand!! Help! Someone please put a comment thingy on my wikipage? And yes, I liked my stream of consciousness style writing. It helps me get those essays written. Users/StarrOleary

20050128 11:38:57 nbsp There you go, now you have a comment thingy.  FYI, I added it by putting {{{Comments}}} on your page. Users/JevanGray

20050601 10:11:04 nbsp Howdy, Starr.  I liked your comment about Woodland, but when you edit entries you can just change the actual content  somebody else wrote it before you and somebody else will come along after you.  Dont be afraid to change whats there.  You are an equal editor to the person who first made the entry  were all equal here. Users/JabberWokky
