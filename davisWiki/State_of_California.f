The State of California is the government of California.  The capitol is just over the Yolo causeway in Sacramento, so theres a fair number of state employees in Davis.  That said, the UC System  while not directly part of the state government  is probably the biggest state level organization and employer in Davis.

Inside Davis, they do licensing, tax and many other things.
