The concept of Statistically Improbable Phrases (SIPs) is used by Amazon.com to help characterize the content of books.  It is a list of phrases that occur more frequently (to a degree of statistical significance) in a given book than in all other books.  For a better description, http://www.amazon.com/gp/searchinside/sipshelp.html/refsib_sip_help/10490505019707948 ask Amazon.  The concept of SIPs is also a useful way to provide examples of how the Front Page wiki is unique compared to other webpages on the Internet.

This page is a repository for SIPs.  If you know of a phrase that occurs on the wiki, but is unlikely to appear anywhere else on the Internet, add it here.  It doesnt have to be completely unique, but just really unique. These shouldnt be confused with Memorable Quotes.

Clearly Statistically Improbable Phrases:
  Ku Klux Klown
  Pootleberry Dinglehopper
  OMGLOLWIKIBBQ
  Epic Quad Battle
  Stapler Liberation Front
  The Effulgence of Biorhythmic Iceburgs in Lake Spafford

  I get 11,500 hits on google for JabberWokky Users/KarlMogel
   damn Users/MichelleAccurso
   A good chunk of those are me.  Note that a search for the phrase JabberWokky Evan turns up almost 8,000 hits.  Since I dont always use Evan, a chunk of the remaining 3,500 hits are for me as well.  It was originally designed to be a kiboesque unique search string and my use of it predates the World Wide Web.
