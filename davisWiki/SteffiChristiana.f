Steffi Christiana has been a Davis resident since autumn of 2004.  She is studying at the University of California, Davis, to attain her bachelors degree in Political Science.  She is also minoring in Music Department Music, and is very dedicated to the arts, as is evidenced by her treble clef tattoo.  She enjoys playing music, linedancing at the The Graduate Grad, making the occasional trip to Napa, dining out, and generally being social.

She is originally from the rural ski resort town of http://www.visitmammoth.com Mammoth Lakes, where she crosscountry skied, played tennis, acted in various theatrical productions, and participated in an uncountable number of hours of community service.  Since moving to Davis, her participation in activities has waned, but she has grown more confident in herself, and isnt that what going to college is all about?
