20110807 15:27:19 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki! I saw your comment on Taste of Thai page, and I have to say KetMoRee across has free Thai Ices Tea refills, and has had it since Day One. Users/NikhilDahal

20120125 11:41:35 nbsp Hey, neat idea for a page!  Ive been a fan of Tumbleweed for many years now, although they arent the only players around.  Im a big fan of modern vardos as well.  Did you get permission to release those photos to Creative Commons?  If not, you can probably just write and ask... and plenty of people have photos of their small houses available. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20120126 09:48:51 nbsp As a bit of information: Theres some confusion if Bruce has progressed to full blown trolling at this point, or its just a reflection of his very unique perspective on  well, pretty much everything, including the wiki.  Hes a nice guy, but probably not the most representative voice when it comes to the traditions of what works on the wiki.  Alas, the tiny homes page seems to have acquired some of aura of the recent edits that he has made. Its not fair (and hopefully my pointing it out will help make people try to separate things), but the wiki  like all groups of people  is a social community, so such things happen from time to time. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, jw.dw@timewarp.org

20120126 11:06:43 nbsp Steph, I want to echo what JW has said and what others have said on the page about tiny houses that you created.  There are two issues going on here.  One is that you inadvertently walked into a very long and very frustrating conversation that many of us have had with BH.  Many of the pages and edits hes created are far less relevant than what youre proposing, so some of the disagreement is aimed at him rather than at you.  The second issue is that, BH aside, some people still want to see more Davis relevance on the page, but others of us (including me) see the page as being on a good track.  All of this is part of the collaborative wiki editing process.  It can be a bit messy sometimes, and sometimes feathers get ruffled, but we hope that in the end the process is a productive one.  Anyway, I hope you stick with the project, the page, and the wiki and continue to work things out with us.  So far, so good, as far as I am concerned!
 Users/CovertProfessor

20120126 11:18:37 nbsp Thanks CP! I will do so this evening or tomorrow eve. I can do some mods for sure based on the conversation. And Im serious about starting a group! I could just see a cooperative village of these tiny houses, with a community kitchen and laundry facility. That would be SO Davis! A nonstudent, modern, mobile version of the Domes. With a couple planned empty spots for traveling houses to park and set awhile. I can dream.... :) SH Users/StephHolm
  That would be very Davis, and very cool!  Go, go, go!   Users/CovertProfessor

20120126 11:59:51 nbsp Hi SH, upon thinking about it and reading comments, I agree that this page has a lot of potential. I  changed the page a bit so it didnt irk me as much. Of course, it can be changed :) but now I feel like its more
Davis like and is a good start for your vision.  Users/jsbmeb

20120126 16:23:45 nbsp Like I said I feel the Grande School site could be easily (well not so easily bought) repurposed for small home style / coop style living with a great addition to the greenbelt

When I as a young warthog I dreamed my idear up Users/StevenDaubert

How exactly do people go about aquiring land within city limits and seeing if this can get done?

20120126 16:36:24 nbsp I believe either the City or the DJUSD owns the Grande school site. But if it were another plot of land, it would be a regular purchase and need to go through zoning, I imagine.  Users/jsbmeb DJUSD owns it, its too small for a elementary school
(which is a joke cause its larger than Korematsu) its already zoned for usage, but easements / integration into the bike path would be my chief concern  Daubert

20120126 16:38:07 nbsp Oh, one more thing... it would be cool if the old Sunrise Farm land on E 8th could be used, but it looks like the developer already may have plans for it. Users/jsbmeb
Sunrise farm is a wonderful beautifully place with a horrible stigma and past, any developer would be foolish to develop that land. Have you been there at night / seen / heard of the sketchyness that occurs there? Daubert

Hm. What are the western boundaries of the city limits? The city limits page of the wiki should be updated with the exact boundary lines, the exact street names. From the map there it LOOKS like the western boundary is the final line of houses at the west side of Marina Circle....directly behind those houses happens to be some farmland for sale (or lease)....hmmmm. Bet its a pretty penny tho.  StephHolm
 The West side of the Covell Dranage channel is as far as houses / the city limits go on my 500 size (3ftx8ft) address map Daubert
   Whahuh? So all of us over in West Davis, west of the West Pond, are not within the city limits? That cant be right. The map on the City Limits page here on the wiki has a blue outline and it looks like it covers ALL the residential up to the backside of marina circle and those neighborhoods north of it. That huge plot of land right behind that is farmland and its for sale. StephHolm
 I bought this map from the city, and had public works engineer merge the databases they use (they were upgraded so my map request made them finally get that ball rolling) The Covell Dranage channel goes North to South on the West end of the city, that is the line on the map. West pond is East of that... It curves West to East on Covell, and then heads up 113 to then make the North Boundary for North Davis. The little pockets next to the town (Wisteria, Patwin, Tierra for that little nook near Cactus Corner Barry, Central Sharron for that development down 113 but before MUNI) arent in Davis. Also El Macero is not in Davis.
  That ditch goes behind the houses west of Marina Circle about halfway from Covell to Russell before it heads west.  Theres only a few yards at most between the ditch and the back yards of the houses.  Its one line of backyard fences from Covell to Russell.  Those houses are the last ones in Davis Users/BruceHansen
     Thanks Bruce that is what I wasnt sure about.....if it went BEHIND the Marina Cir houses. I was pretty sure I am in the city limits! However I could throw a rock outside the limits from my house! Thanks Everyone for clarifying the city limits issue!  Steph Holm

20120126 17:08:30 nbsp Then there is that crazy land of blight, the old processing factory or whatever it is, next to the farmland that is across, more or less, from the North Nugget shopping center. THey have a carnival there once a year I think. What is up with that place? Users/StephHolm
That would be the old Hunts factory When I was young it was a huge warehouse / processing plant for tomatoes. Its since been razed down to the foundation. They left that one tank for when they were going to do the Cannery development, (which would have been fused to Covell Village)


20120126 19:45:48 nbsp Well whaddya know.....I just found out on Facebook that 2012 is the United Nations International Year of Cooperatives. I quote here (http://social.un.org/coopsyear/aboutiyc.html) from their website: With the theme of “Cooperative Enterprises Build a Better World”, the Year seeks to encourage the growth and establishment of cooperatives all over the world. It also encourages individuals, communities and governments to recognize the agency of cooperatives in helping to achieve internationally agreed upon development goals, such as the Millennium Development Goals
The United Nations General Assembly Resolution A/RES/64/136 encourages all member States, the United Nations and all relevant stakeholders to take advantage of the IYC to promote cooperatives and raise awareness of their contribution to social and economic development and promote the formation and growth of cooperatives.

Verrryyy interesting. Maybe something could get started this year! Land donated? Who knows?! Users/StephHolm

20120126 20:18:55 nbsp Two comments: 1) Developer plans have been drawn up for the Cannery; whether anything actually happens with them still remains to be seen (still not approved).  2) See cooperatives page. Users/CovertProfessor

20120126 20:34:14 nbsp It would be cool if there could be a demonstration of Tiny Homes on Grande with temporary utility hookups.  The City and the voters have limited Davis outward expansion and so theres a call for infill.  These little houses could be a form of infill.  Users/BruceHansen

20120126 22:16:09 nbsp I wonder if the Solar Community Housing Association would be interested in starting a new coop of these tiny houses....do they acquire the land? The diff would be that they would allow the future residents to actually construct their tiny homes there on the land, and other future residents could help and learn. Cooperativeness even in building the very community! Users/StephHolm
  One of the issues is that homes below a certain square footage threshold can not be legally constructed.  Thats why vardos are popular and the reason most Tumbleweed plans call for building on a trailer.  By declaring it a mobile home, you bypass those minimum size requirements.  As a result, theres an opportunity because the classification is as a mobile home... and potential pitfalls in zoning for the same reason.  If you think thats bad, try one of my other two architectural passions: underground homes.  In some states its pretty much impossible. ⁓Users/JabberWokky ʝ⍵
      Well, either the SCHA would have to be ok to run a mobile home coop, or we would do it right outside the city limits. Or, we get the code changed. Perhaps because these tiny homes look so fabulous and craftsmanlike, they would change the code for them. Maybe skirting around the trailer would be required. Anyway a mobile home coop of THESE mobile homes, perhaps that would be an easy sell.... StephHolm
         They are also affordable housing. ⁓Users/JabberWokky ʝ⍵
 I was talking to a buddy of mine we can make them like as seen on that site for roughly half the cost.. Daubert
    Thats pretty much the point.  They hold workshops to encourage people to build their own, and encourage using reclaimed wood and similar techniques. ⁓Users/JabberWokky ʝ⍵
         One client from Portland Alternative Dwellings HAD HERS built by PAD for 33k. That is significantly less than Tumbleweed building a Tumbleweed. Then, a lady who built her own Tumbleweed in Washington, I think, did so for about  $7,000. Obviously there is a cost difference between building it with the plumbing and electrical of an RV and the plumbing and electrical for composting/solar/propane or whatnot, but..... anyway, here in 2012 which is the International Year of Cooperatives, maybe a special grant could be gotten, or something. Some kind of featured project. I guess I would have to just reserve my spot now, since I wont have my tiny house for a while :) StephHolm

20120130 14:28:36 nbsp There are no rules on the wiki, only agreements between individuals.  So, if your store seems relevant, then its fine.  Its a collaborative effort among people who have equal rights to the content.  (Okay, there are actually a couple rules that the IRS says we have to abide by to stay nonprofit, but those seldom come up... make it about the business rather than a commercial, and youre fine). Users/JabberWokky

20120130 18:25:32 nbsp there is also a list of Davisite owned websites Users/StevenDaubert

20120130 19:16:09 nbsp Looks like JW and SD already offered their opinions, so Ill add mine: go for it!  I dont see why a Davisbased online business is that different from any other Davisbased business.  In fact, when Alphabet Moon closed and cited competition from the Internet as one of their reasons for closing, I thought, geez, they could have had an online store and offered free delivery within Davis (one possibility: hire students on bicycles).  So, glad to hear that other Davis businesses are doing that.  (Of course, competition from Target is another story, but I wont get into that). Users/CovertProfessor

20120202 06:20:48 nbsp Hey, whats on the Facebook page?  I cant see it. Users/JabberWokky

20120202 12:52:19 nbsp I dont have a Facebook account.  Is there any way to visit without one? Users/JabberWokky

20120205 18:49:38 nbsp Steph, It looks like the Tiny House page started to get converted to third person usage by putting quotes around some first person phrases, but the article hasnt been completely converted.  Its possible that might help the movement.  I can see of course that yourre one of Davis most ENTHUSIASTIC members. Users/BruceHansen

20120206 00:07:37 nbsp Bruce: I would be shocked if no one else in Davis is considering one of these homes or planning on building one! I was thinking I should mosey down to the Community Cooperative Network and pick some brains about how to get a village started:) Users/StephHolm
 You could also try the Davis Community Network.  An active member of the Board of Directors that I met and could be helpful is G. Richard Yamagata. Users/BruceHansen

20120206 12:01:21 nbsp Yahoo is kind of seen as dying (as a company).  Their groups have gotten so erratic that a large national group Im a member of that depends on them is actively looking for other options due to dropped and heavily delayed messages.  Id avoid Yahoo at this point.  You could always just wiki:wikispot:create a wiki... when you do so, you can choose to require logins to edit or not.  Note that Im not saying create a wiki page but rather a new wiki, like Davis Wiki or Sacramento Wiki.  That said, a wiki is a great resource, but does not have mailing lists and the like that are really useful for a more focused group.  Google Groups has everything youd need, but they are changing things around across the board this year.  In the past they have allowed you to use them without a Google account (like Yahoo), but I dont know if that will be the case soon.  I think so, but Id verify before committing.  Google does have the benefit of having their http://dataliberation.org Data Liberation working group that makes sure you can always leave Google for another service.

Theres a big discussion Im supposed to be following (as Im the member representative for our local group) about replacing Yahoo.  Ill read through it and see what good online community resources have been suggested. Users/JabberWokky

20120206 12:47:11 nbsp Its not so much that as the fact that I cant get any information about the group without signing up to a service.  Thats kind of the opposite of the point of the world wide web and publishing information.  Youre publishing information about a group  and then hiding it away.  Seems like it should be openly visible.  Also, I dont think Google or Bing will index it if its private, so people who are interested in tiny houses will have trouble finding it. Users/JabberWokky
