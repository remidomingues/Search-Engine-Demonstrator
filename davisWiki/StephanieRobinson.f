20070814 13:35:47 nbsp The two highlights which we are starting to organize now is 1.) 9/26 (Last Day before classes) there is another Democratic Debate, and we want to DVR it, see if we can have a BBQ at the Colleges, and then watch the Debate afterwards, and 2.) 10/10 We are trying to get Lois Wolk to come in and speak about her work in the Capitol, past history in Davis, and goals with the 5th SD.

I already have a rough plan of mtgs/events for all of Fall Quarter, and it should be completely shaped up by startmid September. Im excited, cuz its going to be a great year. Users/MaxMikalonis

20090925 18:41:30 nbsp I had Clarke for 101 during SS2, and she truly amazing. I have never gotten so much out of a class in my life. It also looks like were both in 123 w/Kono. I have a couple other friends in that class, so we need to study together and set the curve. Hope everythings going well with you. Users/MaxMikalonis M.

20100217 12:17:15 nbsp haha I didnt get your comment until now Max! I dont check very often, sorry... But yeah, I didnt really enjoy her class at all. Most of the students needed a lot of help with writing, so I think she had to make the class easier so they could catch up. Im glad it worked for you though  it was what made me decide NOT to go to law school! haha Users/StephanieRobinson
