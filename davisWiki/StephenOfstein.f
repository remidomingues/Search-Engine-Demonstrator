20110501 15:26:59 nbsp Welcome to the wiki!  I saw the edit that you just made on the Computer Repair page.  I encourage you to create a separate page for Shrike Computers, but you should probably read Welcome to the wiki/Business Owner first.  The edit you made to the Computer Repair page was (in my opinion as a fellow editor) overly promotional, which is a nono for this nonprofit wiki.  To be more specific: the wiki is written by the community, so edits you make should be written as though any community member could have made them.  Its unlikely that the community would say this guy beats out all the other guys.  Informational edits about your business are great, though!  Again, welcome! Users/CovertProfessor
