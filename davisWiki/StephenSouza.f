This is your Davis Wiki user page, which is typically used as a place to post information about yourself.  I created this user page for you so that others can leave notes about your edits and discuss things with you.  Because youre a public official, you also have a biographical page (Stephen Souza, with a space) and its expected that other people will control the content of that biographical page.  Feel free to remove this message once youve read it! Users/PhilipNeustrom

That allows nice small images on the page that people can click on, and also allows for captions.  For more help, read the wiki:wikispot:Help with Images entry.
