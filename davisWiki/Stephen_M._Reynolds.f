20120531 17:49:05 nbsp Having known Stephen professionally for over 20 years, I think I am in a position to say that he is a competent, honest attorney. He is probably the best bankruptcy attorney in Yolo County and many local attorneys consult with him when they have questions.

As for the specific incident here, I think the following facts are pertinent.  Steve left for vacation believing the petition had been filed.  That was a mistake, but it was not dishonest.  Second, at the time this happened, and while he was away, his secretary was in the process of having her husband die.  Frankly, I am surprised at the harshness of the penalty from the Bar.

Though I dont claim to know the facts myself as i was not Steves partner at the time, I dont think WesP has any facts to support the idea that the client lost everything because of an error on Steves part.  In my experience, when someone is facing a foreclosure sale, filing a chapter 7 petition will only delay the inevitable.  By the time a foreclosure sale is about to happen, people are many months in arrears, and they have to come up with many thousands of dollars cash, or the foreclosure will contiue.  That means that the net result of the bankruptcy vis a vis the house, is that the client will gain two or three more months of occupancy before the foreclosure actually occurs.  I doubt very much that the client lost the house because the bankruptcy was not filed.  Users/clundgren
