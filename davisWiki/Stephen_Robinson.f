Stephen Robinson is a professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at UC Davis. The Sacramento native and graduate of UC Davis with a BS degree in Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineering (1978) was employed by NASA for 36 years, making four trips into space as an astronaut on the space shuttle, including the 2005 Discovery mission, wiki:WikiPedia:STS114 STS114 which Robinson designed the wiki:WikiPedia:Image:STS114_Insignia.png patch for. Robinson made NASA history when he performed a http://www.rednova.com/news/politics/197338/repairs_made_on_shuttle_underbelly/ live on TV midflight repair of the shuttles underbelly by pulling off two protruding strips of ceramic fabric that NASA was worried could damage the shuttles sensitive heat tiles as the shuttle reentered Earths atmosphere. Robinson is the first astronaut to see and touch the underbelly of a space shuttle in space.


As an undergraduate student at UC Davis, Stephen was an active KDVS KDVS DJs DJ, specializing in folk music. He spent a term as the program director of the station, the person in charge of making the schedule for when all the different shows are going to air, and also the person being sure the content that is broadcasted is up to par with KDVS standards, and isnt illegal.


Stephen is also an accomplished guitar player.

Stephen in an alumnus of the Banduh and took a tape of the band into space on wiki:WikiPedia:STS85 STS85 in 1997.  He was also a Picnic Day Grand Marshall a few years back.  Stephen also carried a copy of the June 7, 1997 edition (which carried a feature on him) of The California Aggie into space, and gave it to UC Davis Chancellor Larry Vanderhoef, complete with signatures of all the crew members.

Robinson also made the first ever http://www1.nasa.gov/returntoflight/crew/robinson_podcast.html podcast from space.  Unfortunately, he did not do a KDVS station ID from space, despite how cool This is Steve Robinson on Space Shuttle Discovery and youre listening to KDVS 90.3FM would have been.
