 Positions on Controversial Issues 

  Measure J debate: Souza has said he supports renewing Measure J in its current form.
   Users/StevenDaubert notes that recently Souza abstained from a vote during a city council meeting that fixed an attempt to skirt measure J when it came to development just outside of town... Ruth Firmly opposed, Greenwald and Hestek for, and Souza and Saylor Abstaining... Election season move anyone?
    This was a vote on my request for Councils reconsideration of a prior reccomendation to LAFCO on the City of Davis Sphere of Influence (SOI), not a vote on Measure J. As a Commissioner of LAFCO I will at the next LAFCO meeting have a vote to determine the City of Davis SOI. Users/StephenSouza 
  Halema Buzayan case: An http://www.davisenterprise.com/archive_pdfs/2008/20080525/pdfs/C5.pdf opinion column in the Davis Enterprise said he felt that the case had been handled appropriately.
