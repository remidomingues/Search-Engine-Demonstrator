Sterling Court apartments is a rental housing community developed and managed by Community Housing Opportunities Corporation CHOC for very low, low and moderate income households. Sterling Court also provides a resident services program which provides residents with professional staff to assist them in enhancing the quality of life within their residential communities and achieving individual personal goals.

Located close to downtown Davis, this fourplex was purchased and renovated in July 1993. Initially financed with conventional bank loans and the City of DavisÂ’ Housing Trust Funds, Sterling Court offered two bedroom units affordable to residents at or below 80% of Yolo County median income. A subsequent refunding ensures affordability to residents below 60% of median income.
