Sterling Pointe offers one and twobedroom apartments and is located on Unitrans F bus line, J bus line and G bus line. Sterling Pointe works well for people without a car. It is 1.6 miles from Campus, on the G Bus Line, and is across from Anderson Plaza. This means you have access to groceries at Save Mart, great burritos at Taqueria Guadalajara, and videos at Redbox.

They have completed an extensive remodel of their clubhouse which now has a computer and printer for resident use as well as ample studying areas. They have begun to offer remodeled units which are more expensive than the nonremodeled ones but have a lot of new things in them.

The complex has a pool, four washers and dryers, a 24/7 study lounge, and 24/7 workout room. The workout room has two treadmills, a weightlifting machine, and a stationary bike.

Twobedroom apartments have two bathrooms, a spacious kitchen, and a living room. Air conditioning is limited to the living room, so you will need to purchase a fan to keep yourself cool in the summer.

The following rent prices:(2014)

  $995 for 1 bedroom 1 bath
  $1290 for 2 bedroom 2 bath

Deposits:

  $500 for 1 bedroom
  $600 for 2 bedroom

Their office hours occur from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm Monday, Wednesday and Friday. And they have an after hours emergency line if you have something that needs to be taken care of right away, which is kind of nice.

As with other most other properties in Davis now, you have to pay a water/sewage/garbage fee each month, but it is based on a per person rate of $20.00 so you can use as much or as little water or garbage as you want and only pay $20.00.

Sterling Pointe has opened their Fall 2014 waiting list! Email them or call to find out their new rental rates and to be added to the waiting list.

20140129 17:34:46 nbsp Compared to my previous apartment experiences, Sterling Pointe is one of my top two favorites. The apartment manager is great; she is very personable, I always feel comfortable talking with her. She is always working so hard she even renovated the club room which now has many study desks and even a keurig coffee machine!!. Ive never had any issues with paperwork either, which happened too many times at other complexes. As a bonus, breakfast is free during finals week.
My biggest problem with the complex was my living situation and when I needed to break the lease the manager went above and beyond what I expected to help me resolve the issue.

The apartment itself is great too and is in a great location it is close to Savemart and Safeway. I also loved the bus stops close by; they get to campus in 10 minutes.

My only complaint would be that they could have been faster to fix things in my apartment but this was only a minor inconvenience.

Overall I would recommend living here, the rent is very reasonable. Users/SaraCouch

20140216 22:08:01 nbsp  Great location, great looking apartment, great price and great manager. This is the first apartment complex Ive lived at that Ive loved. My apartment was in great condition when I moved in. Its across from Savemart and several restaurants in case you dont want to cook. The study lounge is very homey so its easy to stay there for most of the day studying. It also has a computer and printer. The gym is small but it has the essentials so you can still get a great work out. All in all I give it a 9/10!! Users/DoryGarcia
