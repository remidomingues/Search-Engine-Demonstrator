20120607 10:56:05 nbsp We LOVE LOVE LOOOVVVE Sterling Riding Academy and Shelley!!! When my daughter (who was pretty young at 4 yrs old) couldnt get enough of pony rides at fairs/market/etc we thought she might be interested in riding as a sport. Shelley was recommended to us from my cousin who has been riding since she was little girl, and she couldnt say enough wonderful things about her. So of course we called to get a little more information and see if it was the right decision for us (which it was). I am grateful that Shelley recommended us trying a lesson, then seeing if she kept talking about it or if she liked it but wasnt die hard about it, being as it is such an expensive sport. My daughter has now been riding for 8 months or so, and every day asks if its time to go ride Izzy, making sure we have big carrots in the fridge and then gallops off around the house. Shelley has a wonderful and unique way of teaching that gets the children interested at any age, like riding backwards, and you can tell she truly enjoys being out there instructing. She is incredibly patient, I am in awe of how she can stand there instructing and keeping my daughter focusing on what shes doing, all the while answering the 8 million questions my daughter is throwing at her. We are lucky to have found such an incredible place with amazing people! Users/cmfarinsky
