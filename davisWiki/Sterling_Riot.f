Sterling Riot is a seven piece folk/punk group originally founded by Rob Roy, described by Sacramento News and Review as folk and punk, mixed with trains crashing and dragons dying.  The full review can be read http://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/Content?oid607723 here. The music can be found at http://www.myspace.com/sterlingriot myspace.com/sterlingriot or http://www.purevolume.com/sterlingriot purevolume.com/sterlingriot.

Originally a one piece band, the crew of castmates now includes Users/RobRoy Rob Roy on guitar/banjo/vocals, Users/WillJobe Will Jobe on drums/backing vocals, Jackson Jordan on bass, Users/TobinJones Tobin Jones on lead guitar, Andy Voss on glockenspiel, Rachel Beane on violin, and Carolyn Cantwell on accordion.



The six current songs on the Myspace profile are:


All 4 tracks on the myspace were recorded by the band at Robs house using http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/ Garage Band on Robs eMac. The instruments that have appeared so far are the guitar, drums, accordion, and glockenspiel, bass, theremin, viola, some others,  as well as many computerized instruments.

Rob was going to release a CD titled Love Letters to an Expatriate in mid September of 2005 but hell most likely never release the CD. The band plans to record an EP of rough takes, appropriately titled Rough, sometime soon in the next couple months.

And yes, the bands name was inspired by the riot at Sterling University Vista Apartments.
