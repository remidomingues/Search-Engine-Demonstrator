Steve Blais is a man of many words.  When he speaks he makes sure the neighbor can hear because thats just how important he is.  He enjoys spinach, Chipotle Tabasco sauce, food in general, not showing up for work but still getting paid, his Apple Computer iBook, and comic books.  He is married to his XBox 360 but would prefer that you keep quiet about it.  His friends never really approved of the relationship.

He has a habit of getting nervous and rambling.  Some people find it endearing.

Here is a list of his favorite movie stars:
  Tom Cruise
  John Travolta
  Mel Gibson
  Keanu Reeves
  Orlando Bloom
