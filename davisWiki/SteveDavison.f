SteveDavison is the elusive mastermind behind the original creation of the Buffets page! Welcome to the Wiki, Steve! Users/PhilipNeustrom

Thanks, Phil! :) Users/SteveDavison (Im elusive???...)

The Wiki is the best thing going on the web today. Its what the web was meant to be. Users/SteveDavison

How do you find me? Im the guy whos always promoting the Davis Wiki especially the Events Board.

When I first came to Davis people asked me why I chose Davis (it wasnt because of school or a job). At a point in my life I realized Id never be able to own a car, so I did a bit of research and found that Davis was the most bicycle friendly city in the U.S. It is said to be the second most educated city in the U.S. That, plus a great climate (no snow, not too hot), not too far away from Silicon Valley and San Francisco, it has a fivestar university, and its in an agricultural area (never go hungry) made it sound perfect. It wasnt too far from Burning Man, the worlds greatest art festival. But the real reason was a lastditch effort to attract a female. In the end, girls are all that matter in life. In fact, theyre the most important things in the universe. This is all still true, however the dark side is: the cost of living here is so high that its highly stressful. Living under so much stress that you can barely sleep at night is no way to live. Perhaps there is a place where one can live cheaply, although without the other advantages. Ive heard Fresno is the poorest city in the U.S. (presumably that means a low cost of living), but people who have lived there say the disadvantages outweigh the advantages, so Ive stayed put so far. Perhaps out in a forest? Or in the desert (cheap land, but what about water there must be a reason nobody else lives there) On a boat or raft (but what about storms, lack of space)? In a school bus or mobile home? That also sounds expensive. Were all the same; were all trying to find our place in the world. A cosmic musical chairs.

On food: I practice the Seefood Diet. I see food, I eat it. I prefer wiki:WikiPedia:Vegetarian eating plants to animals. My lifelong dream has been to have an open account at a food store, such as our wonderful Davis Food Coop. In this fantasy whenever I wanted food, I could get it at DFC and just have them put it on my account. Id always have great food, and never be hungry again. I suspect this fantasy is shared by the majority of Earths population. As it is, all my food either comes from dumpsters or closely related places. But, as I go, so will the rest of Earths population.

On the students who live in the Domes and the On campus Coops: They are so beautiful, so beautiful, so beautiful. I have dreams about them.

Things I love: Grad students; they rock. Seminars. Marimbas. Bicycles. Art. Clever, creative, brilliant things. Helpful people.
Things I love...NOT: Cars and car drivers. Stupid, illogical, thoughtless things and stupid, illogical, thoughtless people.

The bicycle in the photograph was Stolen Bikes stolen. So if you see one which casts an identical shadow, please bring it to my attention. Identifying features: wiki:WikiPedia:Bicycle_wheel Round things in the front and back, wiki:WikiPedia:Bicycle_handlebar swively thing in the front.




My roommate called both campus and the county about a bird that appeared to be dying from a nerve disorder in our yard last week, and the county said they werent interested while campus said they might come out to take a look... nobody ever did. I posted the info on West Nile based on the CDC site, so Im going to revert it, but you can revert it back if you have a more concrete source. Users/AlphaDog

20050914 11:43:29 nbsp What city did you used to live in?  I just saw your post (yours right?) about Douglas Theaters and I know of only two cities they operate in (one of which is Lincoln, where Im from). Users/CarlMcCabe

I made Cafe Italia as a redirect on purpose because it is a very common spelling mistake by most people.  Its not only nonwiki users who spell it wrong. If you do a search for it, youll find it in a lot of comments that way. And because it exists, searching for Cafe Italia will result in Caffe Italia at the top (it didnt before I think, though it might have). A redirect is easier then trying to fix every spelling mistake made in the past and that might be made in the future about it :P. Users/EdWins ES

(Moving here instead of The California Aggie so it doesnt clutter.)

Incredibly though, the California Aggie is not available online. Sure, you can read some of the contents (and limited archives) at the website, but this highly abridged version does not contain the daily calendar, advertisements, classifieds, weather, and other essential features. (Come into the 21st century; just put the paper as a .pdf on the website. Possibly even have the daily calendar as a separate page, or .rss too.)
  The website sucks, but the http://www.californiaaggie.com/calendar Daily Calendar is certainly online.  Personally, Im not sure classifieds online is the best idea considering it has a low potential profit yield, especially with http://sacramento.craigslist.org better alternatives.  As for weather, they get that from http://weather.com weather.com so they do little in that respect, regardless.  The weather could easily be on the site for completeness, though (itd probably be from weather.com or something similar, though).  Wire stories arent online (they dont pay the licensing to put them online and they are to found in many other places). I disagree with your assertion that the California Aggie is not online, specially when compared to the Davis Enterprise which does not put any free content online (you cannot access materials over a week old).  The site is currently being redesigned, and will have advertisements, but Im sure the advertisements will be different than those in the paper because online ads attract a different demographic than paper ads (and the paper is much more wellread). Users/PhilipNeustrom, Online Director, California Aggie
    Whoa. I guess I struck a nerve. I read your comments on the page while you were editing it. All I meant to say was that the paper, as in the printed version, is not online and I wish it was. I didnt say it sucked, and I wasnt complaining about them vs. the Enterprise. I read the CA whenever I can, which is much more often than I read the Enterprise. I like the paper, I dont have any complaints about the content or even the website layout. My wish though is that the Daily Calendar have its own static URL though, i.e. californiaaggie.com/dailycalendar or such. This way I could have my browser start up with it to quickly check it in the morning. I also think having a facsimile of the paper (.pdf or such) online is also desirable. Ease up on the coffee... Regards, Steve.
     Sorry about that!  I was editing to tone down my comment but you had already responded! :)  Nobody dislikes the site more than I do right now!  I think, most of all, there needs to be more consistency in terms of design between the two.  Features like Muse are only slightly represented because of the current design.  The next version of the site needs to be more flexible in the way it displays stories.  Its frustrating to me right now because Im currently writing a new version of the site but I am responsible for the updating the old, broken site!  Again, sorry about the tone!

       No problem. Do seriously consider having a static Daily Calendar url though. Even just a symlink is fine. Thanks.

Hiya. Actually, the StudentNutritionAssociation redirect served a purpose. The secretary of the club sent an email to all of our members with wrong wikiaddress (without underscores between the words, while the correct address has underscores), so I figured it would be a pretty common mistake. Thus, the StudentNutritionAssociation redirect was born! I apologize if thats a wiki faux pas. Users/AnnaJones Anna
 No problem. When I noticed it was recreated I figured it really was intentional, for some unknown reason. Youve answered that. p.s. I wanted to attend your recent meeting, but after much ambivalence decided Id be outofplace there, so didnt.
   Thats too bad. We have a handful of nonmajors in the club, so you wouldnt have been too out of place. Swing by our table at the Activities Fair if youre still interested and talk to one of us if you have any questions; Ill be there myself from 11 am to 1pm. We heart new members. Users/AnnaJones

20051105 10:37:54 nbsp Hey dude, me and Norris are up for it next week, hes gone this weekend. So, yeah, definitely, well give it a try. Got any ideas where you want to stop first? Users/JohnDudek

20051105 11:09:29 nbsp Huh, I see that I did set the starting point and I did a translation too so the origin was in the center, if I am looking at the right file and it renders fine too. So maybe it was a bug in Ghostscript that got fixed in an automatic upgrade since I did it before. I see that gsgpl has been upgraded at least twice since then. I learned about PostScript at a LUGOD lecture Micah J. Cowan gave on http://www.lugod.org/meeting/past/2005.02.01.php 20050201. For some time before then I had had this desire to generate pentagrams and it was in June that I realized Postscript would be perfect for this. So I got the tutorial and reference manual from Adobe, and since I had forgot most of the stuff from the lecture, they really helped. It also helped me learn about postfix which was really cool too and now I want an RPN calculator. So yeah, Postscript is great. I havent done much with it since then, but I just read about how the NeXT display system was based on Postscript and now the OSX display is based on PDF and that is really awesome too. I wish there would be a free vector display system so I could use it in Linux. Cool stuff, and thanks for the tip. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20051120 11:21:50 nbsp Older fellow isnt offensive, IMO. It doesnt imply an us at all. Its relatively commonly used and more respectable then older man or anything like that, and doesnt imply as much age as using the word elder in there. Newspapers also use older fellow at times. Im surprised youd think Scooter Man as a title isnt respectful. He did edit that page a bit, and its what most people see him as. If he was offended Id imagine hed do or say something about it. Thats the point of the page. No one would see him ride by and know his name is Daniel.  Likewise, thats why theres a Visor Lady page. Seen her through a very visible feature, but know nothing about her.  Though Im also surprised you didnt find offense at it saying she waddles around campus. Users/EdWins ES
  I did notice that he (presumably) edited the page later. I stand by saying it implies us, since pointing out a difference is by definition a matter of separation. Everyone elses page doesnt say a younger man. Re: Wanda: I probably wouldnt use waddles, but in a way I dont find that quite as bad as something one cannot change (race, gender, age). Dont feel that I am terribly offended, as Im realistic and thus have a high offense threshold. However,  I still wish to be especially polite to those who are least able to rebut whats being written about them. I stand for truth, but that doesnt mean we cant be polite about it.

20051123 23:09:39 nbsp I dont think the spare changer page needs a template table at the top.  Its not a part of any template, and two of the fields in that table were empty (and easily seen in the following paragraph)?  Users/PhilipNeustrom

20051127 20:23:01 nbsp Old habit (mailto macro) I guess. If you look at the old version, there was some weirdness in the email anyway. Is the circ you posted for davis only, or the total circ? Users/ArlenAbraham

  Oh, now I see what you mean. I use mailto: whenever I write emails (outside of the Wiki), so I just automatically ignored it, like when seeing the local area code in front of a phone #. See ya. Users/SteveDavison

20051127 23:50:39 nbsp Looks like youre going through pages and making a sort of standard layout for hours and whatnot, thanks! Perhaps a page describing the format used should be in order, to help others in your crusade... Users/TarZxf
  I dont systematically go through pages (that would be like writing the Yellow Pages phew!), but if I chance upon a page for another reason, and if I see spelling errors, missing info., or just things which need to be improved I do fix them. That to me, is the raison detre for the Wiki. Thanks for the appreciation. I have thought about creating a style sheet/guidelines (now that I mentioned it I suppose I have to do it...) I recognize that others have different opinions of what style is correct, so I often hold back if I feel they really meant something a certain way. This is one of the drawbacks of using this medium for collaboration we dont have immediate feedback from all the parties involved.  (But if you do want to, edit Wiki Style Guide)

20051128 01:15:57 nbsp Its multiple choice between the most common answers, with an option for writein responses if the choices dont match what people say. The question asked was What do you call a traffic situation in which several roads meet in a circle and you have to get off at a certain point? As I just edited on the page, this leaves open the question of whether regions willynilly use these terms, or there are in fact more roundabouts near Davis, and more Traffic Circles elsewhere. Oh, and BTW, I coincidentally took the updated version of that linguistic survey a few days back, and happened to remember that question when you brought up the distinction between the two! Users/CraigBrozinsky
  The site said that survey was completed (it looked like it was done in 2002); is there another survey you took?
   Specifically on the circleroundabout matter, one could overlay a national map of them on top of responses. Not all areas have them, Davis seems to have a large number due to the bikes. Of course, all this could just be going off the deep end, considering the worlds problems... :) p.s. I did read the whole California results page; very interesting.
   the new one is http://www3.uwm.edu/Dept/FLL/linguistics/survey/ here and takes about an hour to complete, but its worth it. i think the link i titled preferred term is what youre akin in terms of overlaying. it suggests that there are probably few of these in the midwest cb

20051129 17:18:22 nbsp I noticed youve been changing the time format on every page you hit to :00 for the top of the hour, and the am/pm notation to caps. Whats up with that??

20051220 01:04:44 nbsp yeah the wanted pages are kind of hard sometimes. i feel like i havent done anything worth while on the wikiw for months so i decided to tackle wanted pages. some i know ive seen forever so i just deleted them, if someone wants to make a page they can. theres always a few that simple need to be changed, ie they were linked to the misspelling of a page, or need to be made into a redirect. but with list pages, like frats, sororities, and plants, i just delete. hopefully those groups or items will come by and make a page.

20051223 17:53:00 nbsp Steve, I got that circ. number from the front of some junk mail that was sent to my house. Users/ArlenAbraham
  I too had read a 26kish number off their mail, but it was years old. When I researched it on the web I found their 47k number on http://consumerguide.com/about.cfm where they say Consumers Guide reaches 47,000 mailboxes monthly and 57,000 mail boxes quarterly saturating Yolo County. Its probably a waste of effort to try to get more than 50% accuracy, since there are so many ways to define circulation. Is it for the previous month, the year average? Does it subtract those printed but undelivered/uncollected/returned? Is it just for Davis or for their distribution area (which may be larger or smaller than Davis)? Users/SteveDavison

20051226 00:07:04 nbsp I like the street divisions. If you were really ambitious, you could split things up, West and East sides of the street. Actually, thats a bad idea. Nevermind. Users/ArlenAbraham
   Id thought of that and yes, concluded it was a bad idea. I think putting them into a table with street # on the left is a good idea though since theyre already in street # order. The bullets really arent necessary or meant for long lists like that. Users/SteveDavison
    Yeah, bullets can be annoying sometimes, but the only alternatives are putting a {{{BR}}} after every line, or puting it all in a table. Breaks would work, but the markup isnt as pretty as a single {{{}}}, and each item wouldnt be indented. Tables are even uglier than bullets, especially if you faked an indent. (example below)  Users/ArlenAbraham

20051226 00:12:30 nbsp Ive also proposed a Wiki Walk, where a small party of Wikians might go down a street and get accurate data for everything. Think Sketch Crawl, except Wiki Crawl. Users/SteveDavison

20051227 23:06:21 nbsp Steve, why dont you Davis Wiki IRC IRC with the rest of the the IRC Folk? Users/TarZxf
   I didnt know there was anyone on there. I heard few use it. Ill check it out. SD

20051231 21:04:30 nbsp Steve, could you please revert your changes to JK microsystems.  You changed the m to M.  It is properly lowercase.  You can check the website to confirm.  I fixed the text within the article, but I cant figure out how to fix the heading.  Thanks. GrumpyoldGeek
  My change was simply because its out of keeping with the rest of the Wiki (which I feel goes overboard in forcing everything to start with upper case) SD

20060114 08:29:47 nbsp re: Davis Psychic  I removed them (or rather, agreed with DavisWikiGnome, whoever that is) because they are content free comments, and dont really add anything to the entry  RocksAndDirts comment being the only possible exception, which should probably be an edit directly to the page.  I dont have a strong opinion on the matter  Im just voting my mind by doing one revert.  If you revert it back, Ill disagree, but I wont revert it back the other way (although I might rewrite the comments into the main entry  which is difficult in this case, which is an indicator that the comments dont add anything to the entry).  To sum up, my revert was a mild vote of agreement with DavisWikiGnomes original deletion.  I dont feel particularly strong about it either way. Users/JabberWokky

20060116 04:09:26 nbsp it was kind of lighthearted, and I enjoyed it. Sometimes things can be offtopic, yet valuable for other reasons.  I agree.  Thats why I wasnt strongly against them, just mildly on the side of deleting them at the time I did it.  If you feel strongly about it, restore them; Id leave it alone  Id save an argument for something that I do feel strongly about. Users/JabberWokky
   I agree.

20060206 21:31:48 nbsp Steve, I dont see what the harm is in including the international country code in the phone numbers for e.g. YEEP.  Including that information benefits people from outside North America who might have reason to contact the entity in question, and it doesnt prevent people in this region from doing the same.  Whenever I contact entities outside the US, I always find it frustrating when they dont include the country code. Users/GrahamFreeman
  I agree with you in principal, however for just one page (among thousands) to have it adds more confusion than clarity. The correct place to put that info. would probably be on the Davis or Area Codes pages. There should be a Visitors page which would have that. It would have sections for outoftown, outofstate, outofcountry, and outofplanet (extraterrestrial) visitors. Outoftown (extracity) would mention that Davis is a college town and has a progressive, affluent, and highly educated populus. Bicycles are the preferred mode of transportation, vegetarians are welcome, and smokers are not. Outofstate (extrastate) would mention that Bush is not highly regarded in these parts... Outofcountry (extracountry) might apologize for having Bush as a leader, would explain currency, time & date formats, comma/period usage, international dialling, English weights & measures system, electricity standards, languages, etc. The extraterrestrial page would say that life is organically based here, homo sapiens are the dominant species/genus, describe the state of technology, customs, laws, ethics, religions, controversies, etc. SD

20060314 02:43:58 nbsp Why did you take those slashes off the end of the urls on Rays Food Place? Users/NickSchmalenberger
  Partly because I knew if I did youd write something here (since I couldnt leave a revert comment...). I was going to ask you why you put them there? At least under FireFox they arent needed. Is there a technical reason or another reason? Most URLs here do not have them, and I wasnt sure why you added them. Am I missing something? Again, nothing personal, I use revert as a last resort, but this was a way to get your attention. me
   I just performed an experiment with netcat where I requested the address of my listening netcat with and without the slash and all requests that netcat received had the slash, so it seems that most browsers (I tried firefox, wget, and lynx) insert it for you if you dont put it in. On the other hand, some servers http://www.dcn.davis.ca.us/ seem to serve a request with no path and others dont http://www.google.com/. In section 5.1.2 of rfc 2616 it says Note that the absolute path cannot be empty; if none is present in the original URI, it MUST be given as / (the server root). So, / is the default path, but I dont think we should rely on the client or server fixing it for us if we can make a proper http url. Users/NickSchmalenberger

  True. In defense of... myself... Bike Church did explicitly state We will have our next work party on March 18th, 2006.

20060404 16:38:06 nbsp hey steve, Im not quite sure where you originally came up with those dates for Cow Crank, but 14 was definitely in 2005. Maybe if you review the edit history it might spark your memory as to where you got the other dates from. I think maybe you gave the slogans years as if they were 1,2, and 4 not years 11, 12 and 14. Also, other than your comment I cant find any mention of Cow Crank 15 on the page.Users/AmeliaCarlson

20060405 13:57:18 nbsp Well I fixed the dates on the Cow Crank page... but as Ameila pointed out, all the incongruent dates had come from your editing.

20060411 17:42:55 nbsp That phone number for the Turtle House is actually for the business office of the landlord. Do you think that the page should say that, or say nothing, or what? Users/NickSchmalenberger
  In this case, the landlord is closely involved with the music, so yes it is appropriate. Having no number helps no one, and having the landlords number may be perfect for those looking to book a show there or such. If theres a better number, Id change it, but it seems to be appropriate so far.

20060417 19:36:42 nbsp Is the Domes > The Domes redirect really necessary? Users/ArlenAbraham
  In a word, yes. The point of redirects is to make the DavisWiki more userfriendly. That is, to reduce frustration caused by people having to enter names in some exact format which they could not know in advance. There are many places here which have The prefixed, and which dont. The person should be able to get the place by using either form. If there was a mandated rule to never use The, that would be different. Users/SteveDavison

Actually, yeah, there are a bunch of people going by bike from the Davis Food Coop. Call up the Coop and ask for April Kamen or maybe for a manager. Someone should know about the DFC people who are going to Hoes Down by bike and be able to give you contact info, or maybe their route.

If you miss that bus, you can get to the http://yolobus.com/m3.html Cache Creek Casino, but you have to first go to Woodland. Theres a bus that leaves at 8:55 am from the County Fair Mall. From Cache Creek, its not very far to Hoes Down. And at that point its safer to use the main road, because the Casino traffic will be behind you. Backroads are better, but I dont know those.

I fear youve inadvertently made a gaffe here.  Do you have a list so we can try and run back through them?  Users/JabberWokky

  Businesses are required by law to publish public notices http://www.yolorecorder.org/forms/files/fbn/FBNStatement.pdf in a newspaper giving their true name, address, etc. (See Business and Professions Code) In this case, my source is the Davis Enterprise, start of the Classifieds section. I am not putting anything private here, so I stand firmly that theres no gaffe here. Some are home businesses, so their home addresses are given. I have no other source for information other than whats printed; I encourage others to add to these seeds. Users/SteveDavison

     Okay, if it was published, no problem.  I was worried you had managed to snag a copy of the Rotary Club phone list or something like that that wasnt really intended to be public.  If they published their own information in a public location, no worries.  It was just the unknown source that appears to have home addresses rather than business addresses that was a bit worrisome.

Post Script: But nice try though! Im going to let you add the deli part back in.
Post Post Script: Just you dont mistake my incredulous response as vitriolic please call (707) 6785553 and ask for the deli, or even better go to Frank Ts BBQ and order 1/2 lb of sliced pepperjack, 1/3 lb of salami, or you can go to the case to the left and order entrees already made up...

  (Regarding my renaming of Frank Ts BBQ page): It may BE a deli, it may be a wonderful deli, it may look like the quintessential deli. This had nothing to do with it. My reason is simply that they dont have deli in their name. Its not in their domain name, anywhere on their website, business links to their website, or even in any of the other links I could find to their website. Therefore, I conclude it is not part of their name. Asking if I am high is low.Users/SteveDavison

20090920 09:44:33 nbsp How about turning gallery cafe into a redirect? Users/JasonAller
  I dont think thats even necessary since Gallery Cafe is nothing more than paint on the wall. It is not a separate business entity in any way from the Gallery. If they start using that name in advertising, then I would change my position. Right now I dont believe anyone including themselves uses that name. Every other property of the place is shared with the Gallery (entrances/exits, hours, taxes, licensing,...). They also have an area where they sell books, if they hang a sign saying Gallery Bookstore would we then make a redirect page for that? Until it comes into common use, Id say no. No redirect pages just for the sake of having redirect pages. When the term starts to come into common use, then I say by all means make a redirect. SteveDavison

Aesthetically, I think the business templates have actually been bad for the wiki. It makes it less clear that people can just come on and write this stuff however they feel like, people shouldnt have to learn as much conventions for wiki style. At the same time, people do need to learn what pages already exist for and having the names of existing pages more visible is helpful this way. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20091011 20:54:47 nbsp William and I got our shower curtain at the Woodland target and were quite happy with it. What exactly is so stupid about the bike racks anyway? I dont know, I havent been there yet. Users/NickSchmalenberger
   They installed bollardtype racks. They dont hold your front wheel, so that it tends to turn sideways and your bike slides and falls down. The loops are front and back, not where you really need them. They consist of large posts, which take up space, thus reducing density. To park two bikes next to one bollard, the second person has to park lefthanded (walk to the left of their bike, remove and attack the lock from the left side). Perhaps not an issue for lefthanded people. The only bike racks which are worth anything are the http://www.creativepipe.com/lightning_bolt_LR_series_racks.htm LRP/LRXP, fortunately these are common around UCD, the City of Davis, and http://lbre.stanford.edu/sem/sites/all/lbreshared/files/docs_public/UACPD_BikeRack_V1.pdf Stanford University. They were apparently designed by http://www.bicyclesolutions.com/about.html John Ciccarelli of Stanford. (Incidentally, Stanford is one of the top five greatest universities in the U.S.A, the others being UCD, MIT, Yale, and Harvard.) Steve
  Could you explain that on the Target page? Maybe with less negativity, its actually kind of depressing to me how much negativity there is on the wiki lately. I think if there simply arent enough bike racks thats maybe a bigger problem than these being somewhat less usable than another design. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20091026 22:02:28 nbsp Philip and Steve  the images coming off that webcam link are either corrupt or otherwise odd.  I did a simple convert cam190.jpg SpamHaus.jpg using ImageMagick to reencode the file and the new one works fine. During the conversion, however, ImageMagick reported that:
{{{
convert: Premature end of JPEG file `cam190.jpg @ coders/jpeg.c/EmitMessage/226.
convert: Corrupt JPEG data: premature end of data segment `cam190.jpg @ coders/jpeg.c/EmitMessage/226.
}}}
...so the image is likely just a broken format that the wiki is bouncing as an invalid image. Users/JabberWokky

  I discovered that. Its just cam190, cam191 is OK, and its just a header problem likely a format config issue, as many utilities read the image fine, Im testing a variety of workarounds. Im on top of it...
