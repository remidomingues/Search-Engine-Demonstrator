Moved to Davis in 2000 to attend the University.  Graduated with a Psychology degree and went to work as a private investigator.  However, shortly after the death of my youngest brother, I quickly discovered that I had to pursue my passion: a career in music.  So now, I drive Taxi Services cab part time to supplement my income and play in a death/black/prog metal band, http://www.myspace.com/forsakethefleshmusic FORSAKE THE FLESH. Thats just the surface... if I put down on here some of the things that have happened in my life, most people wouldnt believe me!  So thats for much later when we know each other better ;)

Miscellaneous:  I study martial arts two to three times per week, try to remain active (gym, running, etc...), studied Spanish culture and language in school for years (wayyyyy rusty now!), and I am a huge Hockey (Sharks) fan!!!
