Steven Ostrowski is a student at UC Davis who is a controversial and politically active member of the religious right.  He was president and founder of the Christian Democratic Party, chief editor of The Davis Enforcer and selfappointed president of the thendefunct Students for Life at UCD group. He has held various positions at the Newman Center. He is currently a member of the Yolo County Republicans. He is a founding board member of the defunct Upsilon Sigma Alpha, a political fraternity.

Ostrowski was quite active in ASUCD. He has written many bills and resolutions for the ASUCD Senate, most notably several unsuccessful bills that would require that the Pledge of Allegiance be recited at senate meetings. He was the ASUCD representative to the Academic Senate for Academic Freedom and Responsibility. His confirmation was controversial, ending with a 651 vote. In the past, he has held the position of ASUCD Senate recorder and Internal Affairs Commission recorder.

Ostrowski was confirmed by the Senate for the position of External Affairs Commission 1st Alternate in a 760 vote, which was later determined an unlawful appointment. ASUCD Vice President Genna Carnes had to break the tie. Very shortly thereafter, he became a full Commissioner after the Vice Chair left the Commission. After he attempted to http://media.www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2007/01/29/CampusNews/Asucd.Commissioner.Sends.EMail.Offering.To.Privately.Negotiate.Court.Case2682681.shtml?sourcedomainwww.californiaaggie.com&MIIHostmedia.collegepublisher.com coerce Senate recorder Users/BobbyGray Bobby Gray into letting him edit the senate minutes by offering to drop a court case he was pressing, the Senate http://media.www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2007/02/05/CampusNews/Ostrowski.Fired.From.Asucd.Position2696779.shtml?sourcedomainwww.californiaaggie.com&MIIHostmedia.collegepublisher.com fired him from his position by a unanimous vote.

Although he seemed to dissapear from the ASUCD scene, he remained active in local politics, writing a http://davisvanguard.blogspot.com/2008/10/guestcommentaryopposingviewonsame.html guest column at the The Peoples Vanguard of Davis Favor of Proposition 8.  He also worked to win Missouri for McCain.



 History 

Prior to moving to Davis, Ostrowski was http://www2.cde.ca.gov/be/ag/ag/jan04item12.pdf selected as the 2nd Alternate for the 2004 http://www.cde.ca.gov/nr/ne/yr03/yr03rel82.asp#att US Senate Youth Program as a senior at Anderson Union High School. In January of 2003 he was involved in the Great Valley Centers youth program concerning California issues specifically drug rehabilitation.  He was a also a member of the http://www.greatvalley.org/gaby/docs/progreport03.PDF GABY board and selected various grants for the Redding California area, advocating the defeat of a procontraceptive grant.


 ASUCD Court Cases 


Ostrowski was the Plaintiff for ASUCD Court cases 3640, but on the Court found him in contempt for having not filed a brief for his first case nor showing up at the scheduled hearing.  Consequently, all pending cases by him were dropped and it was ruled he could not file any more cases for the rest of the Winter 2007 quarter.

Users/BrentLaabs Brent Laabs filed ASUCD Court Case 41 against Steve, alleging his publication  The Davis Enforcer violates ASUCD bylaws through unfair endorsements of candidates. The paper is under the courts jurisdiction because it is an AS PAPERS publication. The ASUCD Court ruled in favor of Ostrowski, ruling that the Davis Enforcer did not officially endorse any of the candidates as the bylaws required that a document be filed for an endorsement to be official.  Ostrowski was counsel for Edward Baraona in ASUCD Court Case #43.

 ASUCD Election Activity 

Ostrowski worked to support Christian Democratic Party candidate Ronald Payne in the Winter 2007 ASUCD Election. Previously, he was an ASUCD Senate campaign manager for Kirk Cowgill, and Dustin Murray in the Fall 2006 ASUCD Election.  He is now the cochair for Solidarity.

Ostrowski  was the http://media.www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2007/02/16/CampusNews/ExecutiveOffice.Candidates.Debate.Student.Wages.Services2725038page3.shtml No Campaign Executive for the ASUCD Winter 2007 Unitrans Fee. Ostrowski believed that due to the terms of the bill (required 20% voter turnout), he had a good chance of winning as his goal was just to tell people not to vote. However, in the largest voter turnout since 2002s Move to Division I, 89% of of over 5,000 students voted yes. Had those that voted no not voted at all the measure would have failed.   Steve was also No Campaign Executive for the Outreach Assembly.  This bill was also passed in the Winter 07 election with 66% of the vote.

A bit of controversy was started when he systematically went from classroom to classroom erasing LEAD chalking during the Winter 2007 ASUCD election. He has admitted to this, but claims to only erase chalking from an election ago in order to create more space for newer events and states that chalking is, de jure, not allowed.   Although the majority are, not all chalkboards are erased and cleaned over winter break (typically the overlapping, sliding chalkboards have an occasional one or two that is overlooked).  Nonetheless, the original allegation held that it was being done at 6am, long before classes begin, and that it was new chalkings being erased in Wellman Hall.

 ASUCD Legislative Acts 

Steve Ostrowski has written quite a bit of proposed legislation for ASUCD, many are regarded as useless, annoying, and distracting.  The primary cause for this may be his stubbornness. He has said before he is content to resend the same bills over and over til he gets what he wants. One example of this is a bill about the Pledge of Allegiance. He is preparing to try to get it passed a fourth time. While the vast majority have failed in IAC, two have passed  and a third passed after a complete rewrite by Users/BrentLaabs.

During Spring 2006, Mr. Ostrowski authored one bill:

 Internet Activities 

After a Ban Steven Ostrowski long, long time on the verge of being banned, Steve was Wiki Community Proposal 1: Steven Ostrowski banned from the DavisWiki on September 10th, 2007. He is still welcome and active at other wikispot wikis. Shortly after being banned from the Davis Wiki, Ostrowski founded the Redding Wiki and promptly banned the majority of active Davis Wiki editors from it.

He has also been banned from Facebook (for a second time).


 The Empire Nation 

Steve was the host of the KDVS public affairs show  The Empire Nation from 20070129 to 20070927.  It aired Thursdays in the 8:309:30am time slot. He often volunteers on the Math Robot show using the name DJ Empire.




20070221 19:27:04 nbsp Dear Steve,  I can guarantee you that no one from LEAD created that ad, I know that for a fact. No one on the LEAD slate has been dishonest and no one posted that pic of you. Please stop spreading the slander and instead point the blame at the individual who actually did it. Users/GennaCarnes

20070221 19:33:40 nbsp I would consider it libel......anyway, its probably Brent who is LEAD.  That and I am on the defensive.  So I shall not retract as of yet.  Users/SteveOstrowski

20070222 01:21:02 nbsp I dont follow ASUCD proceedings, nor do I have any very good reasons for my voting for LEAD, but I just thought I would point out that Steve, if not for his projecting his radical personal agenda toward ASUCD, has lost my vote for the disorder he causes in our Student Government.  I would much rather have an ultraconservative student politician, with an agenda truly in the interest of progress, than one whose only accomplishments, ultimately, are instigating controversy and widespread irritation. Users/LeonardMarque
You are not voting for me in anyway way, shape, or form.  And I wouldnt consider myself an ultra conservative at all.  Users/SteveOstrowski

20070222 05:55:06 nbsp Steve, even though you are one of STUFO‚Äôs biggest allies, we do not blame them for your antics and inappropriate behavior. We have encouraged all of our supporters to have respect for everyone and about 99,9% have and I am truly sorry for the individual that disrespected you. It is the last day of elections and I am requesting (hopefully not blindly) that you play clean and fair for the next 24 hoursno more ripping down flyers, no more erasing chalk etc. Please let the voters decide and don‚Äôt take away from the hard work that many candidates have put it. Users/GennaCarnes

There has been no erasing of chalk or tearing down of flyers by me ever this entire year or any other quarter.  I am pretty close to findout out who did it, and so I will allow the ad to expire, which it should just about now.  Users/SteveOstrowski

20070222 11:06:04 nbsp No, Steve is a coward that posted the LEAD flier on facebook himself.  Look at his profile and under posted items.  You will clearly see that half an hour prior to his Dont vote LEAD flier, he convenient has a Support LEAD flier posted. You know, its pretty easy to see that you are using sleezy tactics Steves, but I guess that would be expected from someone of your caliber, your track history isnt the best.  But lets not start talking about libel... considering YOU were the one that posted the so called lies against yourself.  Users/HamBedri
  Okay, no because I already know who did it and he admitted to doing it.  Secondly I uploaded the photo for the purpose of getting the ad taken off.  If one is using a facebook photo illegally it adds to my case.  And I dont think we have ever met, so I dont know where you come up with this stuff. The reason I was so quick to catch it was because I am constantly going through Facebook with messages, invites, etc. And dont send me message and then block me afterwards. Users/SteveOstrowski


Some Student Focus volunteers will note that Steve on more than one occasion campaigned for the Yes Campaign and seemingly forgot to pass out his 500 flyers. Users/SteveOstrowski Annonymous

20070223 21:43:33 nbsp I find it kind of ridiculous that after clearly campaigning hard against the ballot measure and even expressing belief that hed clearly win, proSteve elements would now have us believe that WAIT HE ___WANTED___ to lose!  LOL Users/KrisFricke
    Someone ProSteve? Who else would it be but Steve?  Hes out of town, someone commented have fun in Texas, IP is from Texas,and who else would try to play that ridiculous mind game stuff? Why he didnt just use his own name to edit, I dont know. Users/EdWins ES
     Maybe to prove that if he is banned, he can still come back and play the same kind of game that got him banned in the first place. Users/KirstenOnell

20070809 21:09:22 nbsp Haha, oh wow.  Thats an awesome wiki page on ED. Users/BrentLaabs
  I was saddened that it didnt include talk of Steveos make thousands from home in only a few years website...  Users/StevenDaubert
   Check under the heading Pyramid Scheme. Its all there.  Users/WilliamLewis
     no that just talks about the mobile phone thing, I was referencing this: http://www.takeactiontoday.com/
Users/StevenDaubert
     just interesting I found http://www.explosivemlm.com/Websites/Bjorn.htm sites http://www.explosivemlm.com/Websites/Beth.htm that http://www.explosivemlm.com/Websites/Corey.htm I http://www.explosivemlm.com/Websites/Johnny.htm have found http://www.explosivemlm.com/Websites/ about a similar matter. Amusing. ~D

20070830 17:28:04 nbsp The truth is Steve, people can be successful without cheating. Furthermore, its understandable that people would disagree with our policy or beliefs. But, saying we cheat just because you disagree with us is either a really big bluff and lie on your part or signs of extreme paranoia. . Users/JamesSchwab

20071114 19:20:47 nbsp I have a direct quote that Steve is opposed to the sale of organs. I cannot believe he would have such an objection to one of the finest musical instruments. Users/DavidPoole

20071205 23:42:47 nbsp One of these days we need to hold a luncheon to raise money for Spences campaign. Users/JoseBleckman
