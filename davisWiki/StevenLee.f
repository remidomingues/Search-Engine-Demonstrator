20100504 19:52:05 nbsp Its a great contribution to update those student candidate entries with their current information.  It really adds to the historical value of that segment of the wiki.  Is there any public record of past slates, candidates and officers?  Extending into the past would allow information to be accumulated on people involved in student government from decades ago.
