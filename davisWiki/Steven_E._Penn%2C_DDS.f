20130830 16:50:39 nbsp Dr. Penn was recommended by my regular dentist, and I went to see him in July. After examining me, he did a good job of explaining my options for treatment. For various reasons, we decided on a conservative course of a lot of an NSAID, and seeing what happened. That got me to where I didnt feel I needed a root canal, and (eight weeks later) still dont. So, Id recommend him at least for being willing to be conservative in treatment when it seems warranted. Users/DougWalter
