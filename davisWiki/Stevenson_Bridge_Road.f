Stevenson Bridge Road is located to the west of Davis, about halfway between Davis and Winters.  Stevenson Bridge Road starts at Sievers Road, just a few miles west of Pedrick Produce, and runs due north until it crosses Putah Creek at Stevenson Bridge and becomes County Road 95A, about half a mile south of Russell Blvd. The road is very close to the start and finish line of the Wednesday Night Time Trials.

As of 20070501, the Solano County Roads Department is in the early stages of a significant improvement on Stevenson Bridge Road from just south of the bridge down to Campbell Road.  The project will take about one full month and includes the following components:  (1) widening the shoulders on the east and west side of the road by about 3 feet; (2)  digging out the severely degraded sections of the roadway surface and re paving them; (3) applying a final chip seal treatment for the entire length of the repaired portion  about 2 or 3 miles.
