What better way to express your love for Davis Wikiand spread Wikivangelists The Word than putting a wiki sticker on your laptop, bike, car, binder or child? The original sticker reserve has since run dry, so rather than make a second run of the same sticker, Users/ArlenAbraham I thought Id give the community a chance to design the next wiki sticker.

 What 

Were having a sticker design contest. The Wikizen who designs the best sticker will have their design printed en masse and receive a pile of free stickers. Please limit your stickers to smallish squares or rectangles. Two colors is preferable (one vinyl color, one ink color), but we might make exceptions if the design is super awesome. Designs should be in a vector format or bitmapped at 300 dpi. Leave margins of at least 1/8. Dont try to do any halftoning or any other pixel tricks as the sticker process doesnt take kindly to that kind of thing.

 Who 

You design it, users/philipneustrom Philip picks a winner (hes paying for them).

 When 

Please upload your designs to this page by midnight on May 21.

 How 

Here is some source material:


If you dont have Photoshop, Flash or Illustrator, you can use opensource alternatives like http://www.gimp.org/ The GIMP or http://www.inkscape.org/ Inkscape.

Image(URL.png, thumbnail, 400, Per Dauberts suggestion) {{{<}}} You cant tell from this, but everything that is white would be transparent, and the sticker itself would be those resuable static cling to glass type stickers, Afixable in a store window or a car etc ...  Users/StevenDaubert
Sadly, looking into it, static cling stickers are a bit pricey, but then again, I only checked google. ~DavePoole

 


 


 

 


 


 
Something in the same vein as the original. The tiffs are the correct size (4.25 x 1.38) at 300 dpi and the designs have sufficient margins.

20070507 19:48:23 nbsp I couldnt open that .svg extension (maybe its just me, though) Users/MaryLieth
 Its in a format thats very convenient to a graphic designer. Its all good. The same thing is in the PDF. Users/WilliamLewis wl

20070508 01:02:40 nbsp Basically the same as before, but transparent except for the logo and the URL which would be black, it would also be the kind that sticks to glass I belive by static cling or something. it should say daviswiki.org/.............
where people can put something with sharpie or whatnot, ideal for business etc. Im will whip up this idea sooner or later, please not it wouldnt be periods but a underline, but the wiki hates me so it underlines the rest of my commentUsers/StevenDaubert
  Post Script: If I win I would use my pile of stickers to go around to business and have them pimp for themselves  and the wiki as noted in my wiki proposal. Meybe I should link my wiki proposal but I will do so later
   oooo, i like that idea. fillintheblank is great. Users/michelleaccurso michelle

20070509 12:14:30 nbsp I just want a sticker of the old design for my bike. :\ Users/WilliamLewis
    20070510 08:33:17 nbsp go to the sticker request page and make a seemingly futile request for one!  Users/StevenDaubert

20070510 14:15:15 nbsp How about.... (First line) What dont you know about Davis?
(Second line) DavisWiki logo Users/stevie13

20070510 14:42:54 nbsp What about some kind of Read about it on the Davis Wiki campaign?  In other words, when people go to a new business or organization because of something they read on the DW, they should tell that business or organization.  I did this recently with a local hotel, and the response was, more or less, hunh?  That shouldnt happen.  A read about it on the Davis Wiki campaign would encourage people to talk up the wiki via word of mouth;  businesses and organizations would definitely take notice, since they are themselves trying to figure how best to spread the word.. Users/CovertProfessor

20070523 12:56:06 nbsp Nobody submitted a design!  Even if somebody would recreate the old sticker with the proper dimensions itd help get some out faster! Users/PhilipNeustrom
   I was going to have David Poole whip up my concept sometime in the near future, but JA pretty much hit the nail on the head...

20070523 19:50:05 nbsp Can we combine the second line on Dauberts with the first entry, it is more of a request for feedback that way maybe?  Users/DavidPoole

20070525 10:06:47 nbsp any feedback on the designs I submitted? I hope theyre used! ) Users/EliseKane

20070525 13:36:23 nbsp I like the cow. Users/JabberWokky

20070526 00:56:07 nbsp Needs some color, bolder text, sharper picture lines... Users/Jedron
  Excellent  could you upload your suggested changes?

20070526 11:19:57 nbsp Suggestion:  A tandem bike (a la Elises excellent bike idea) with the motto Davis Wiki: Ride Together or Davis Wiki: The More the Merrier.  The bike idea is really fantastic, Elise.  I just thought a tandem bike might capture the multiple people working together idea.  Single or tandem, though, the bike logo is great. Users/JabberWokky
  I have this vision of an edit war being depicted as a bunch of bikes riding in a constant circle around a UCD bike traffic circle. Users/WesHardaker

20070608 22:55:06 nbsp So has a design been chosen? Whens it bein printed? Users/EliseKane

20070617 22:06:07 nbsp Ill say that http://daviswiki.org/Wiki_Sticker/StickiWiki_Design_Contest?actionFiles&doview&targetShare.png this is the best here, stickerwise.  It gives a hint of what Davis Wiki is.  Ill start looking into printing it.   I also like the bike one, but it needs a lot more polish before it could be printed.  Users/PhilipNeustrom

20070617 22:45:22 nbsp Philip, what kind of polish are we talking? Users/EliseKane

20070618 13:49:19 nbsp More color would make it stand out and be noticed much more. Users/Jedron

20070618 14:29:35 nbsp I still think mine is the best. FU B.R.! Users/JamesSchwab

20070619  What do people think of this color combination? Users/EliseKane

  I prefer the the black and white that you did originally  I think it will be more visible and more striking.  I like your design quite a bit, actually.  The only change I would make would be to smooth out the bike graphic a little bit.  Maybe add a dash symbol, i.e: FIND IT FAST â€“ DAVISWIKI.ORG (with the dash on the first line).  Users/CovertProfessor

  The graphic needs smoothing out and the bike and text dont really go together crispness wise.
    Yes... a distressed font would work well.  Or something like a schoolbook simple rounded serif font.  I flashed to a version that reads Davis and Wiki above, and underneath Goes together like a Bicycle and your Ass.  But I dont think that works well.  http://cheshirehall.net/link/ws/wink.png  Still, something drawing a comparison to how the wiki fits Davis like Bicycles fit Davis would work well. Users/JabberWokky

20070625 19:12:54 nbsp Can somebody upload a simple replication of the original sticker design (see Wiki Sticker) that is completely ready for print (see http://www.123stickers.com/index.asp?PageActionVIEWCATS&Category202 for some details, perhaps)?  If someone does this Ill send it off to be printed.. Users/PhilipNeustrom

20070625 19:14:26 nbsp How do people feel about a square sticker with just the roundabout?  Perhaps some text someplace around / near it..? Users/PhilipNeustrom

20070626 13:24:43 nbsp I think its a waste that a few people, myself included, spent time designing stickers and now a decision is being made to print the original boring sticker. If decisionmakers are going to go with their own ideas, then why create a design contest in the first place? Users/EliseKane

   Because none of the images uploaded on this page are print quality.  Upload a print quality sticker to the specs of the sticker site (thats linked here) and I will immediately go and order stickers.  Nobody has uploaded a sticker that is printable, even as of now.   The requirements are roughly:  a single color (black and white is absolutely the cheapest  going up to two colors costs about $100 more), crisp, no borders (looks odd on a sticker) and looks good, and of the proper dimensions.  I could spend time to fix up some of these designs to make them printable, but thats why we are having a contest  so I dont have to.  :/  Short of that, I am thinking we should just print up the old design as none of the more exciting ones are printable right now and demand for stickers is through the roof.  Though, reading through this page, the requirements were not made clear.  Ill hold off reordering the old sticker for a few days to see if anyone uploads something print quality before then.  Users/PhilipNeustrom

20070628 21:34:54 nbsp I like Dauberts fill in the blanks suggestion the best. And I feel that it could work on a sticker.  It probably isnt the only one we should make now, though. Users/BrentLaabs

20070628 22:19:47 nbsp Davis Wiki  Why everyone knows more about Davis than you do.
DavisWiki.Org Users/EdWins

20070628 22:29:02 nbsp Remember that were making stickers, not billboards. Even a simple sentence would be too much for these stickers as wed have to shrink the text down to the point where youd have to be rather close to the sticker in order to read it. Also, some of the designs are incredibly intricate. At a distance, its all mush and hard to make sense of. Also, the sticker process that would be used doesnt take kindly to pixel manipulation to make textures.

Remember: The simpler, the better. We want these things to do their work, even at a distance. Users/WilliamLewis

20070629 08:52:23 nbsp I vote for the orginalishinvereted.
 Users/JamesSchwab

20070629 14:06:47 nbsp I was originally thought of it being like http://Daviswiki.org/ with the {{{_______}}} being below it, and when combined makes the URL for the specific page that sticker has been customized. This way it can be slapped randomly with nothing, or put on a pay phone with the payphone project DW url, or on a store with that stores wiki page etc. Users/StevenDaubert

20070629 16:56:41 nbsp Hiya. Can anyone show me the link for the proper dimensions of the sticker? I would be grateful. Users/EliseKane
