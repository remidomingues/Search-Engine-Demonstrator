Serving the Bay Area Bay and Sacramento areas, Stoltz Flooring was started in 2006 by two young entrepreneurs from UC Davis with experience in forest preservation and management with the USDA Forest Service, and highend home improvement in the granite and home audio industries. Appalled by the environmental problems associated with many flooring options and the price of ecofriendly alternatives, weâ€™ve decided to make a difference.

As an up and coming hardwood flooring company specializing in environmentally friendly, highend flooring, we purchase only the finest products from around the globe, neglecting any options with substantial negative environmental ramifications. With Stoltz Flooring, you can rest assured that you have the best value, best installation, and best product without harming the environment.

 Products 
We offer the finest quality tile, bamboo, and hardwood flooring as well as expert installation with representatives in Sacramento and the San Francisco Bay Area. Our low overhead and efficient business plan allow us to provide premium products and installation at an extraordinary value. We will gladly ship anywhere in the United States, but extra charges may apply. Email us for a free estimate!
