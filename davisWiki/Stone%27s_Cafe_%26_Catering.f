20070306 13:59:26 nbsp Since I have visited Stones Cafe several times over the past week (I work close by), I thought it is about time that I include my comments.  I have tried quite a few items on the menu, and I am very impressed with the quality and taste of the food.  The food is very good.  My favorites so far are the Flurries of Curries Chicken Sandwich and the Jerky Turkey Wrap.  The chili is fantastic, and the butternut squash soup (soup of the week) was some of the best I have had.  Service was pretty slow the first week, but they have improved tremendously since then.  Right now, it is just Mark and Chris, and they have hired one other person for the weekends.  They are actively looking for employees.  They have also had some equipment issues, which is not unexpected for just starting out.  Mark runs the counter and is very friendly and courteous.  I really hope they stick around longer than the previous establishments in this location. Users/DavidGrundler

20070309 13:37:48 nbsp This place has great coffe! I went there this am and was pleasently suprised. I had the schizophrenic mocha ( like a tuxedo), it tasted so good. Although I was super hyper for the rest of the morning and still am feeling extemely lively. ) Mark was very nice and pleasant to chat with as he made my drink. He said business has been really good.  Users/MyaBrn

20070319 13:39:51 nbsp They had a special sandwich containing smoked salmon, bacon, bitter greens, and a garlic aoli for less than $6. It was pretty big and, despite my Jewish sensibilities, the bacon went well with the salmon. The fresh parmesan shavings on the top give them extra points for garnish, but Im not sure I liked their choice of (french) bread. Ill definitely be back for their other sandwiches. Users/CraigBrozinsky

20070327 22:05:06 nbsp I love this new place. They have the best coffee in town. I had a white Mocha with Raspberry. To die for. Yummy!!. I also tried their chicken salad sandwich very tasty. They were kind of slow, but very nice. They seemed to really enjoy their new place. I will definitely be coming back, especially for the coffee.  Users/KristinaJohnson

20070328 17:50:41 nbsp I am posting from there right now.  This is my first time trying the place, and I had the Flurries of Curries Chicken sandwich and a large coffee.  The sandwich was extremely delicious and it is some of the best coffee Ive had in town.  Combined with free wifi and I think this is a great place.  Highly recommended. Will be coming back for sure. Users/ChrisNeff

20070330 20:39:28 nbsp I love this place!  I had the dizzy mocha this afternoon for the first time.  It was fantasticmade by Mark.  My husband had the raspberry snow mocha made by JasonSUPERB.   I have had several other items previously... the curry chicken sandwich is the best, but what seriously takes the cake are the GIGANTIC cookie icecream sandies.  You gotta see them to believe them!  This place is on my short list for favorite places in Davis. Users/JenniferMolina

20070404 23:03:21 nbsp I think the food is fairly good.  Im not so big a fan of their wraps, however that is due to the fact that i dont like cold store bought torillias, which is what most places like this use (the filling was pretty good here in the hummin wrap).  The curry chicken sandwich is quite tastey but fairly rich and sweet, with those candied sunflower seeds (can be too much for some).  The salads are good but the dressings does not taste homemade (the taste and texture is like a good store baught dressing).  Overall i will go back, but its not amazing.  And what is up with the super tiny water cups, uber annoying. Users/MattHh

20070405 13:19:36 nbsp I went there today out of a time shortage for lunch.  And I must say I was surprized!  I actually thought about leaving because their menu did not look all that great to me... But I decided to have the Hummin Veggie wrap.  I love it! Its full of great flavors, not like so many other bland veggie items that are out there.  It was also very fresh tasting, great produce!  Users/Jessica

20070406 22:05:38 nbsp My boyfriend read about this place on the wiki as I was still in mourning over Huong Lan. tear. Anyway, we checked this place out. I like it and hes madly in love. Ive had the Thai chicken salad (nothing exciting) and the Veggie Hummus Wrap (veggies with hummus and avocado.. very yummy). My bf has had the speared pig, jerky turkey wrap, and the curry chicken all good, especially the curry chicken, which keeps him coming back for more. And the service is nice too! Users/ThuHo

20070425 08:12:54 nbsp Yum!  Im going back.  Food was very fresh and folks were nice.  I want to try everything on the menu.  Food for vegetarians and meat eaters. Users/CatAdams

20070429 20:54:37 nbsp I just had Stones Cafe cater my sons First Communion party.  All the food, sandwiches and salads, were fresh and tasty.   Great presentation, and HOT coffee!!!  Users/ZachStidger

20070430 13:43:33 nbsp Love the food and drink here!  The Bleu Moo (seen on their daily specials menu) is outrageously good.  The kids size ice cream is huge (and delicious)!  The staff is very friendly.  It is a quiet place to study and I will definitely bring my business to them more often. Users/GeorgiaKk

20070507 19:17:24 nbsp It rocks.  I thoroughly enjoy the Speared Pig sandwich.  Flurries of Curries isnt too shabby either.  I am hoping to try the Jerky Turkey wrap soon.  It is lovely and clean inside, and would be a great place to study if I still had the need to do so.  These sandwiches are reasonably priced and have wonderful, attractive ingredients.  You get a better quality sandwich for a better price than the Nugget!  I highly suggest you try this place if you havent already!!! Users/CatLa

20070617 20:56:44 nbsp On our first visit, we had the Plain Jane (as a wrap), Hummin Veggie Wrap and a Fuji Apple salad.  All of the dishes were great.  The people who work there seem really nice too.  I hope they stick around  weve started telling all our friends about them already.  I like the simple menu  it is better to have just a few excellent items rather than a whole lot of mediocre ones. Users/CoryHamma

20070718 01:31:41 nbsp Ive changed my opinion of this place. I used to like it and now I love it. My favorite food place in Davis. I always get the veggie wrap or the fuji apple salad. Try their specials; theyre so good! They had this wickedly awesome eggplant sandwich that was one of the best sandwiches Ive ever had. Also, the owners are really friendly and willing to improve their restaurant per peoples suggestions. Today they gave us gigantic portions for some reason. I am not complaining. Users/ThuHo

20070811 16:55:47 nbsp I love this place! My favorite is the Speared Pig. Users/JoeLow

20070812 15:28:34 nbsp This place is really good.  I has an iced snow cap mocha this weekend and I loved it.  Im usually fairly picky about white mochas but this is one of the best that I have had.  The orange scone was really good and my roommate really liked the breakfast burrito that she had.  Im excited to try the sandwiches that they have and will be going back over and over.  They have a brand new cashier but Im sure he will be a pro soon.  Give this place a try.  My only suggestion would be to change the HL bakery sign b/c I dont think anyone really knows this place exists.  Also you should advertise in the nearby apartments like university village, greystone and the senior apts. Users/MaijaMangrum

20070814 13:30:10 nbsp WOW! After reading the rave reviews about Stones on DavisWiki, I took my best friend there today and we ordered the two sandwiches that seem to be the most popular on this site and we shared them. Both the Flurries of Curries Chicken Sandwich and the Jerky Turkey wrap were delicious! The Jerky Turkey had the taste of a Caesar salad and I love Caesar salads so the sandwich was right up my alley. The Curries Chicken sandwich was a unique sandwich that you dont find in very many places. I left there not too full and not too hungry so the portions were just perfect. Next, I am hoping to try the Speared Pig which seems to be another favorite on this board. Stones is definitely up there with Sams Mediterrean as my favorite eateries in Davis.  Users/ellenondaviswiki


Really tasty sandwiches and chili.  Everything is really fresh and tastes homemade.  My  new favorite place for a sandwich in Davis.

20071001 21:04:51 nbsp
The food here seems very fresh and healthy, and the sandwiches are all intriguing, the sort of menu where you want to try them all (Im still working on that). Bread can make or break a sandwich — this bread definitely falls into the make category. Its hearty, fresh, and tasty. Burgers are served on a sourdough roll (and I wasnt sure how Id like that — but it was good) with enough greens on the burger to make a salad (plus, of course, other options — choice of about 56 cheeses, bacons, different types of onion, etc.). I wasnt crazy about the mix of flavors on the avocado sandwich, but thats probably just an issue of my personal taste buds. The curried chicken sandwich was much more up my alley. And you can get a real turkey (not pressed deli turkey) sandwich. Woo hoo! From comments on their wiki page, sounds like they used to have an eggplant sandwich — I wish theyd bring it back (swap out the avocado sandwich??). Its also worth mentioning that everyone here goes out of their way to be extremely friendly and helpful; its technically counterservice, but its more like counterservice+.  Users/CovertProfessor

20071014 11:32:36 nbsp I could have sworn I left a comment on this page before.... Anyway, you MUST try their Curries of Flurries sandwich. Although I am not a big fan of curry, I still found this to be very tasty. Back when they first opened, it used to taste sweet, but not so much anymore the past couple times Ive eaten it. Ive also tried their Banana Creme Coffee Blends beverage (a little thick; shakelike), which reminds me of banana pudding! Users/at86

20071015 10:08:47 nbsp This place is not near downtown, but I have gladly ridden my bike on a Saturday for 40 minutes just to go to the Post Office, then here for a raspberry mocha and an Avocado Bravado sandwich (avocado, fuji apples, goat cheese and greens, garnished with red bell pepper and shredded parmesan).  Delicious and healthy.  You can find coupons in the Green Machine booklet.    Users/CalamityJanie

20071028 18:16:15 nbsp LOVE this place.  Service is always friendly, all of the food is incredible, good coffee, great pastries ... I could go on forever.  Id walk a mile uphill in the snow, barefoot, for a jerky turkey wrap and a dizzy mocha.  All that, and organic, fair trade items and renewable, compostable togo cups!  Nice job, guys :) Users/Mummers

20071104 15:05:20 nbsp The food here is REALLY tasty. Must agree with everyone who talked up the curry sandwich (messy but good). Also loved the creamed orange drink and chicken noodle soup.
Weve been scouting replacement cafes for wiki:WikiPedia:NaNoWriMo NaNoWriMo, and so far, other than this one closing early and the location being far out, its pretty dang ideal as a hangout spot. I love that they have real food to eat instead of just pastries the way most cafes do.  Users/JenniferRutherford

20071105 12:20:27 nbsp My husband and I just discovered this place about two months ago, and we have been in 4 times since then. Each time, we  have enjoyed the food and atomosphere, but yesterday, we were unsatisfied with the service. It started when I asked for a glass of water with ice. The woman behind the counter told me that they have water in the selfserve area. I explained that I wanted a larger glass, with ice. She said they didnt have larger glasses, only plastic. I said I would take that, and she seemed annoyed. We ordered veggie burgers, and they came out unsliced. I walked them back inside and asked the woman at the counter if she could slice them, and she seemed annoyed. She walked them over to the chef and asked him to slice them. I stood there for a few minutes and she finally said that they would bring them out when they were ready. Again, she seemed annoyed. I went back to my table and waited for a few minutes. Finally, I went back inside just as she was picking up my food to bring it to me. Again, she seemed to be annoyed. I took my food and went back to my table.

The point I would like to emphasize is that in food service, when food comes back to the kitchen, the staff should realize that there needs to be some apologies made and a desire to make the problem right as quickly as possible. It is ridiculous that I had to wait longer than two minutes for them to cut my sandwich. I did note that the chef had another order he was working on, so perhaps he felt he needed to finish that first. In the future, with an issue like this, he should know to push it to the front of the line.

20071107 20:37:54 nbsp I havent gotten around to trying the food yet, but the ice cream is awesome and really cheap for the amount you get. Try the strawberry cheesecake! Users/LilyT

20071129 19:26:02 nbsp My wife and I are among the (fairly) regulars. We used to come by more often when we lived on the eastern edge of Davis. Now that were more inland, we tend to come in on the weekends. Its always a treat to come to Stones and chat with Mark. He and Chris have got a great operation going here, and we wish them the very best. Try the new Cinnamon Shells or a Dizzy Mocha! Users/ArthurFrane

20071206 22:47:37 nbsp Thanks to stones I can no longer think of the word Burger without having my tongue start to loll out of my mouth which forms an obscene puddle of drool at my feet.  I love their food.  I love their service.  I love their coffee. Users/Ericmoose

20080131 12:02:11 nbsp this place is right by my office, nice for anyone in east Davis.  The food is very good, the chili is the best I have ever had.  The ham and cheese pastries are also excellent.  Creative menu items.  The service is what really stands out to me, these guys aim to please, if you want something special they can make it for you. Users/DagonJones

20080227 19:20:31 nbsp I had the Flurries of Curries Chicken Sandwich today (on wheat instead of a croissant because they ran out of it, much to my disappointment).  The chicken is prepared as a curryflavored chicken salad and comes with honey roasted sunflower seeds, lettuce, shredded carrots, and tomatoes. The bread was soft and doughy with a perfect crust and the sunflower seeds complement the sandwich well by adding crunch and sweetness to the mix.  It was delicious though difficult to eat without making a mess since the curry sauce and chicken pieces kept oozing out.  My only complaint is that there was a bit too much oil in the sandwich for my liking.

I have been here twice before in the past. The first time I tried one of the specials and was not at all impressed by the focaccia bread in which the sandwich came.  Pushing my skepticism aside, I gave the restaurant another try and ordered the Plain Jayne, which is a solid turkey sandwich on wheat bread.  The quality of the wheat bread and turkey blew me away.  They roast their own turkey rather than use overly salted deli turkey, so the sandwich you get is anything but ho hum.

While I was there, I eyed the selections of other patrons and everything looked enticing, particularly Thai Chicken Salad, Feta Craisin, Breakfast Burrito, and breakfast croissant. This place does not skimp on portions, so go with an appetite or be prepared to take home leftovers. Users/QS

20080314 14:02:20 nbsp I have to note that the breakfast burrito really isnt very good.  I hate  to say it, because everything else is DELICIOUS.  My favs are the turkey chili and the hummin veggie wrap.  I also enjoy their burgers and fries and the caesar salad.
The quality is good, the staff is friendly. Users/doctorpibb

20080424 20:47:59 nbsp I absolutely LOVE their Feta Craisin salad. The sweetness and crunch from the sunflower seeds add a nice touch to the salad. I like the fact that they use mixed greens instead of just regular lettuce. I will be coming back for more! Users/at86

20080426 19:49:19 nbsp I love Stones.  I highly recommend the Peanut ButterCoffee smoothie, its my favorite thing there, and I dont see it mentioned at all in the wiki comments!! Yummmm....., like a Reeses!   Also, they are happy to do substitutions; you can get your sandwich (including wraps) on any type of bread they have that day.  Users/Catan

20080611 21:48:43 nbsp I was not happy with the fact that they had used processed deli meat instead of the usual real carved turkey for my jerky turkey wrap. It just tasted different and didnt leave me feeling full afterwards. I hope that was just a temporary change instead of being permanent. Users/at86

20080613 13:08:20 nbsp I went here many times, and only a few selections greatly impressed me.  The burgers were pretty good, and the sandwichs were above average, the rest werent that good.  Also, the staff was friendly, and the coffee is incredible.  I will probably come back, either for the burgers or the coffee. Users/jrendler

20080710 16:39:32 nbsp I came to Stones this afternoon to use the wifi while enjoying an iced mocha and it seems like the A/C isnt working or cant keep up with the 110 degree weather.  Id avoid this place if its 100 plus.  The temperature inside the cafe is 8385 degrees F.   No ones dripping sweat, but everyone inside is definitely glistening. Users/cwashizawa

20080821 06:18:56 nbsp I stopped in one morning to get a cup of coffee for my wife. Now, Im not a coffee drinker, but this was the absolute best Ive ever tasted. My wife had to get her own cup! Users/RobWestergaard

20080826 16:51:54 nbsp Had a late lunch with the family here  we were all very happy with our Mace Ranch veggie burgers.  Nice staff to boot.  Well be coming back for sure. Users/DataPoint

20080830 08:05:07 nbsp The Flurries of Curries Chicken Sandwich is the best.  This place is also a good alternative for coffee to the always crowded Peets.  I got a scone here once that was great, but they never had it again. I think they make all their pastries.

Great place and good quality. The only reason I can come up with for why its not ALWAYS crowded their is their location. A little bit away for all the students to walk from campus; but that makes it better for residents. We dont have to worry about waiting 30 min for just a cup of coffee. :)

Is this Davis best kept secret? I think so. Everyone should try it out.

20081115 16:21:52 nbsp Tasty food! I also really appreciate that you use real plates and silverware. But could you please use mugs instead of 2 paper cups and plastic lid for coffee?

20091208 14:32:53 nbsp I love Stones sandwiches. My favorite so far is the Speared Pig; the garlic aioli is very delicious. But today when I went to get coffee, the girl at the front thought my 12 oz thermo mug was a 16 oz one and filled it only 2/3...I didnt realize the mistake until I got home. Seriously, thermo mugs may look big on the outside but they are very small....
So if you bring your own mug, be sure to either tell the staff the size of your mug or check how much they gave you afterwards. Dont make the mistake I did assuming they know the size when they didnt ask :( Users/winddolphin

20100113 17:36:23 nbsp one of the lesser known and populated places to eatprobably due to its proximity to campusbut absolutely delicious nevertheless.  i discovered it this year and have been there a few times already.  the sandwiches are wonderful. the more popular ones tend to the the flurries of curry, which is sweet and delectable, and the jerky turkey wrap, which is satisfyingly savory.  Ive only had one drink, which was the raspberry snow mocha, i could taste the raspberry immediately and it was wonderful.  the other great thing about this place is that there is rarely ever a line there; i think once i went and there were two people ahead of me.  definitely one of the best kept secrets in davis.
