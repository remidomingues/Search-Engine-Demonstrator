Stonegate Car Wash used to be a selfserve coinoperated car wash. Be sure to bring enough quarters. There is an attendant during business hours (8AM5PM). Each stall has a highpressure hose connected to a source of soapy water and plain water. A car wash costs about $2.00 for the first few minutes and $0.25 for every additional 45 seconds. They also have a vacuum cleaner.

It became Planet Wash.
