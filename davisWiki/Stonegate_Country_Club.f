20100329 20:41:51 nbsp I went there today and their employees always cover the pool at different times. Sometimes 15 minutes before closing sometimes an hour.  They close the pool up an hour before they close :( Users/DripsJ

20110812 18:04:03 nbsp The GM Steve has decided that he doesnt care for me. Today he told me to throw away my trash while I was eating lunch. Thanks Steve, but Im not finished eating yet so I wont be throwing anything away til then. Day before that he made up a rule that my dog, Maverick, was not allowed to enjoy the paddle boats with us. The paddle boats are pretty fun actually, though they dont go as fast as I remember. And theyre too small for a grown man. Canoes, thats where the action is. I look forward to more advice and rule enforcement on my future visits. Users/MikeyCrews
