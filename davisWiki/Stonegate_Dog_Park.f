 Friendly Canines Create Community!

Membership Limited to members of Stonegate Country Club.  Guests must be accompanied by a member.

Regulations

 1. Curb your pup: pick up their poop, and shout out a friendly warning to other dogs owners if theyre distracted by the enthralling conversation of other humans
 1. Socialize your pup: rarely does a dog not get socialized by the existing pack, but it helps to have some encouragement from the humans... dont be surprised if someone else teaches your dog to shake
 1. First learn the dogs names, then a few months later worry about the humans names... until then, Sierras parents or Bonnies mom will suffice
 1. Dogs are pack animals.  Allow them to create their own social structures as long as nobody has to visit the vet... the phrase, Ed, where is Ed? Ed, can you take a look at this?, should not be uttered very often.

20110401 01:19:59 nbsp   The dogs and community here are fantastic. This is a private dog park, and there are lots of stories of dog owners being scolded for letting dogs pee on the bushes, hose off in the parking lot, and participate in other typical dog park activities. It would be nice if some guidelines were posted to avoid these situations. Users/sweetMeliss
