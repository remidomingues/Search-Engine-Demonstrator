There is no general public access to the lake. Concrete Canoe holds paddling practices on this lake. This ponds pond is in West Davis.

The lake is home to a variety of Town Fauna wildlife, including: Geese, Swans, Coots, Muscovy Ducks, Mallards, Herons and Turtles Red Ear Sliders, .

20090406 12:28:49 nbsp I think so.  Though I may be confusing it with Lake Alhambra, once when I was at a friends house overlooking the water I saw some fish swimming in the shade.  Like I said though, I dont remember which one it was. Users/MasonMurray

  Technically there is no public access to the lake, but often during the summer the boat launch by the far end of the parking lot becomes a bit of an aquatic dog park.  MikeyCrews

20120316 11:55:07 nbsp This site was also used for the infamous Pirates of Stonegate event (198?  1990), hosted annually by the City of Davis Parks and Recreation Rainbow Summer folks.  The event consisted of a guided boat tour around the island, where swashbuckling pirates would engage passengers with a spirited dramatized adventure (think Pirates of the Caribbean but much shorter, and with real people instead of animatronics).  The event also featured games such as a buried treasure hunt, and some fantastic (scurvyfree) snow cones.  A Preoccupied Pipers song carries the name of this event... many members of the band (and Lawsuit (band) before) were Rainbow Summer staff that participated in the event. Users/OldDavis73
