20080217 22:58:26 nbsp is the coffee shop one of those you could study in? Users/ChingChing
  Ive gone in and read the newspaper for an hour or so at a time before. Its pretty small and there arent often many people there. The tables are small. Also, I brought my laptop in once, and the wifi wasnt compatible with my card.

20080226 17:10:57 nbsp Amazing pastries and cakes, not to mention pizza.  Definitely the best choice for bakery items in town.  The ingredients are fresh and you can tell the quality is high. Just the right amount of sugar, too. Users/Lloyd

20080316 15:40:27 nbsp I saw that Aesops Room now has a banner that says Cloud Forest Cafe coming soon, are they moving to downtown?

How do you know that the coffee is house roasted? Do they have a roaster hidden somewhere? I didnt see any signs that said it was house roasted either. If it is house roasted, I guess they own a small roaster somewhere just for this cafe? Im skeptical since their turnover appears to be way too low to warrant/afford it.

When I visited, the barista was friendly enough and explained that all the pastries were housemade and fresh, which is nice. We had an apple turnover type thing, but it wasnt particularly great. I would suggest Kondetorei for baked goods, even though they are mostly Austrian baked goods. Also, Davis Breads and Desserts has a stand at the Farmers market and have by far the best and freshest pastries in Davis, when you buy them there they are still warm!

20080410 15:40:58 nbsp Cloud Forest Cafe is not there anymore, its a new shop run by the owners. He makes everything, and theyre really nice. On Fridays, they run a family movie on their big screen and sell pizza by the slice a fun family outing idea. Users/Hilary

20080726 00:36:00 nbsp Cloud Forest Cafe has moved to a new location: 222 D street suite #10. The plan is to be open by the first week of August. The microroaster has moved with Cloud Forest Cafe along with many new plans for the reopening. Cloud Forest coffee can still be purchased at Ikedas in south Davis where it is sold by the pound (organic is available). There has been much confusion since the move but yes, Stonegate Video/ Coffee and Cloud Forest Cafe are two different businesses. The phone number for Cloud Forest will remain the same: (530)7532164.   Users/AlexaTijerino

20090917 16:24:57 nbsp best pastries in davis, and best video rentals. the coffee sucks, but I choose to suffer a weak bean than support starbucks or peets.  And it is family run, the husband and wife ownership are in there 16 hrs a day 7 days a week, often with their kids running around.  Probably the only establishment in davis which will recieve a positive wiki review from me.  Their chocolate croissants are the bomb, and they have computers. Users/JustinMehlhaff

20091008 21:31:45 nbsp I must say the eating was better than expected.  It really got me through those first couple of days I moved to West Davis with no way to acquire a real stock of groceries.  Good pastries although the coffee they brew is Seattles Best? Im pretty sure but would need to check again.  Either way in espresso form it wasnt bad.  But uh best cafe on Lake for sure. Users/Patrick.M

20100228 11:45:32 nbsp If you use the wireless they expect you to purchase something two dollars or over, so a small coffee ($1.50) will not be enough.  Users/JakeJames

20100716 17:39:26 nbsp This place is dirty and the pastries/cakes are dry and taste funny. Users/JasperD

20100821 11:30:37 nbsp The pastries and coffee at Stonegate are delicious! Rosa and Dario are super nice. This place is great. Users/katkat

20120403 13:55:20 nbsp I was here on Saturday because I needed a place to get out of the apartment and study.  It was quiet and roomy, and I had no problems connecting my laptop to the internet.  I enjoyed a coffee and the MOST AMAZING CHOCOLATE CROISSANT EVER. They have coffee and espresso and make all the baked goods right in the store.  Goodbye, overcrowded obnoxious Peets on Covell! Ive found my new cafe.
Went back on Saturday, 4/7/12 and got a latte and my delicious croissant, but was not able to study.  The children were watching cartoons on a television.  So, still happy with the pastries, but I may need to find another study spot. Users/ChollaCat

20120808 16:06:00 nbsp Checked this place out for the first time last weekend.  Great pastries, decent coffee, friendly service, and decent prices.  I doubt Ill be renting many videos any time soon, but its a nice little place to relax in the morning on a nice day. Users/TomGarberson

20130124 13:55:09 nbsp Be careful when she asks what glass to have.  They are not the same price.   Users/JenniferStanton

20130216 16:36:36 nbsp I kept going to Starbucks by 113 only to find no parking and the place packed. Finally found this spot. Great coffee and pastries. Yes on the chocolate croissantamazing!! Free Wifi with no annoying codes to enter. Never too crowded. A great little spot. And a huge parking lot with none of the downtown hassle of 90 min. limits to parking.  Users/BrentKago

20131006 11:19:25 nbsp My family just had a wonderful time eating the most delicious pastries ever at Stonegate Cafe & Bakery.  We biked there and sat at their outdoor tables  a fabulous thing to do on a Sunday morning (before or after church for some).  Really, I cant say enough good things about the place.

I just moved from central Davis to west Davis. Im in grad school here, and always looking for good study spots. This is my second visit and it seems to be great so far. Here are the pros: not nearly as crowded as downtown cafes, both inside and in the parking lot. There are plenty of tables available, most are standard cafe size, but there are a few large ones too. Online right now, internet is working fine, and there doesnt seem to be a limit, unlike at other places. Coffee is good, pastry we had was great, wifes iced coffee good. Coffee reasonably priced ($1.50 for a small, although there are no refills). The owners seem really nice, and it feels good to support a family establishment, and also a Spanishspeaking family. Basically, it seems to offer all of the benefits of a cafe for a studentreasonably priced food, internet access, big tables, a place to study outside of homewithout some of the hassle that comes with trying to study at a place downtown like Mishkas. I recommend it!
