20051116 16:23:31 nbsp I loved living here.  It was quiet, peaceful, and pretty.  Not a place for partiers.  Lots of vet students. ReginaSikora

20060914 16:54:45 nbsp SBC DSL is available to some apartments in the complex DanRubins

20061214 17:14:12 nbsp My car was broken into from the complexs parking lot two days ago and had the radio stolen... Two months before that my previous car was stolen from the same lot. ( KirkCowgill

20070312 21:39:28 nbsp Due to some bad experiences with aggressive dogs, this complex no longer allows unneutered male dogs.  While I wont be living here because of it, the apartment manager that helped us out was extremely friendly and helpful during the short time she worked with us.  She tried to work out a compromise with us about the dogs, which was extremely generous of her, but the complex owner said no exceptions.  Oh well, nice people though. NicoleSams

20071202 16:51:55 nbsp If you want to live here, it may help to know a resident. When we first stopped by here during our apartment hunt last year, the management was not very helpful. The second time we stopped by, we ran into an old friend in the parking lot. Then we went back to the office and told them we had a friend who lived there, and they promised to hold an apartment for us.

We love our apartment and how quiet it is, but I think the walls must be really thin; we havent had any trouble with our neighbors noise but weve inadvertently been louder than we realized and our neighbors were quick to complain to the manager instead of talking to us about it. Sometimes we can hear deepvoiced people talking through the walls and floor. VERY petfriendly  many dogs and cats around.

Managers and maintenance are very friendly once you live there. I highly recommend getting to know them.  Users/ElleWeber

20080123 10:10:26 nbsp Can anyone tell me what the DSL speed is like in these apartments? Users/EmmyMelton
             We have DSL and most of the time its fine but sometimes it gets pretty slow. Ive never had DSL before though so I dont know if thats average.  Users/ElleWeber
             When I moved in (Aug 2007) all of the DSL providers in the area told me that only the slower packages were available to this complex because of the distance issues associated with the DSL service. I chose to go with Comcast instead, and havent had any problems in 6 months other than the high cost of their service. Users/AricHorstman

20080127 13:51:10 nbsp Why no Pitt Bulls Users/DR337
  I think they had problems with behavioral issues.

20080208 23:58:27 nbsp Does anyone know if the interiors of the apartments are nice here? I was looking at one place and the ceilings were really low, carpets were dingy,light fixtures hanging on chains...kind of had a creepy dungeon feel.  Just wondering what its like here since they dont offer tours until next Friday... Users/carrisaharding
    I paint in Stonegate village in summers, Ive seen first hand how much money John Brinley dumps (very constructively, no pun intended btw) into his complex. What specifically are you trying to figure out about the interiors... The walls will always have fresh paint on them, and Ive seen more than my fair share of carpets replaced. They have good cabinents as well... Drop me a line if you want specifics  Users/StevenDaubert
  I really like the redone interiors, especially the cabinetry which is a paler wood. The loft ceilings with skylights on the top floors fill the apartment with light and make it very pleasant. We have new carpeting and a nice palesalmon colored linoleum and new lightcolored counters in the kitchen and bathrooms. We toured an unremodeled apartment before we moved in, and I didnt like it as much, although they did have fresh paint which always helps. But I know theyre trying to redo every apartment when the residents move out. The interior is the nicest of all apartments Ive lived in while in Davis except for the The Colleges.  Users/ElleWeber

20080209 21:10:12 nbsp I spent a lot of time at this complex when it was new, and it was really a nice place, especially compared to most of the rest of the apartments available in Davis.  I last saw it last Spring, and was very disappointed.  The apartment that I saw was dingy and in bad condition.  The management was not particularly friendly either.  While this had originally been one of my top prospects, I found far better elsewhere. Users/IDoNotExist
  From my experience, the management isnt very friendly until you sign the lease. But after that, theyre really nice. The older apartments arent great, but the remodeled ones are wonderful.

20080216 03:14:30 nbsp so as of now roughly what percentage of the apt has been remodeled? does anyone know?? Users/ChingChing
 They remodel pretty much every apartment that a lease has turned, they cant remodel the occupied units.  Users/StevenDaubert

20080625 22:29:20 nbsp Ive liked living here so much better than the other 2 places Ive lived in Davis.  Since management has turned over, response rate is much quicker, but the only complaint Id really have is that they remodeled my apartment prior to my moving in but a lot of stuff was defectively installed (carpet, cabinets with doors opening wrong direction, etc.) or never installed (like three light fixtures in our apartment).  The apartments on the top floors are really airy though, with skylights, and their animal policy is great, and the complex is EXTREMELY QUIET.  Ive never had a problem with breakins or misbehavior which was terrible in Tanglewood and the employees here are downright friendly  I know them all on sight and some by name.  So, if you can deal with some crappy installation and maybe some SOMETIMES slow response (only has gotten better), then the rest of it makes the place really worth it. Users/NatFin

20080723 16:11:19 nbsp Weve lived here two years and absolutely LOVE this complex!  Be aware that the north side of the complex, with the junior bedroom units (2B/1B) is much quieter, nicer, and filled with longtime residents.  The vibe can be different on the south side.  Every apartment is redone when it turns over, which doesnt always happen in Davis.  Rent cant be beat.  Management and staff are responsive, friendly, and wellorganized, although it does seem to help if you make a personal connection with them.  Theyre very fair with security deposits, too, which is another rarity for Davis. As mentioned, very pet friendly!!! Users/DavisKid84

20090117 15:30:03 nbsp My roommate and I are interested in living here next year but the pricing seems too good to be true. It just seems like there has to be a catch. Any information will be helpful. Users/Davinder
              Davinder, the prices are probably near correct. Im not sure what it would be if you move in as a new resident, but for me my rent is $1100 for a 2 bed 2 bath flat.  The apartments are a bit older The people living here are really nice, and the management is super :) Users/AliceCheng

20090129 15:10:18 nbsp how far of a bike ride is this place from campus/downtown? also, i called and was told they have no waitlist and they will lease on a first come first serve basis at some point in the future. is this typical? do people line up to get an apartment here or is it just whatever. Users/WeiChun
  Its about 15 minutes. Users/OscarSabino OS
  The apartment manager told me that they will have a first come first served leasing on March 2nd.  I was told by my friend that last year she showed up at 4:30am. There were other people waiting, but she was able to get an apartment.  Users/AliceCheng

20090202 03:59:30 nbsp i want to live here?! how do i get in?! also, are they raising the rent here for the 09/10 year? Much Thanks :) Users/JuLuBeez

20090203 14:54:03 nbsp New market prices for fall 2009 are as follows:
Jr. Two Bedroom, $1030  1050
Townhouse, $12801300
2bed/2ba (D plan), $11801200
Didnt ask about the one bedroom or the E plan 2/2...
The price difference depends on whether the unit has been fully or only partially remodeled.   Users/ElHarvey
 The E plan is going to be $1150 next year. Thats the lease renewal price, anyway, but I think theyre all the same (Im in one of those units right now).  Users/AliceCheng

20090223 17:27:46 nbsp Ive lived in a junior one bedroom at Stonegate for the last 3 years and have loved everything about living here. The old manager was a bit nuts, but the current staff, Leanna, Bill, Troy and Jonathan couldnt be more wonderful they are all incredibly friendly and helpful. They have been working their butts off the whole time Ive lived here to renovate apartments, and they all look great. Its mostly vet students and families, so its usually nice and quiet. Facilities (exercise room, pool, laundry room, etc) are very well maintained. I highly recommend living here. Users/GSB

20090313 19:12:40 nbsp Do any current residents know how many 1 bedroom apartments (either of the two size options) are available on the top floors (to maximize sunlight)? Are these apartments located in noisy areas (like across the parking lot from other complexes where tenants are less than quiet)? Users/egghead

20090429 19:22:58 nbsp Are there any availabilities for Fall 2009??? Smaller one is ok, like the Jr 2? Users/StephHolm
  Youre best off calling the office directly, but know that the Jr. 2s tend to be the more popular (and therefore less available) units, since youre basically getting a two bedroom apartment for the price of a one bedroom.

20090430 16:32:02 nbsp is there ANYONE with a jr 2 or a smaller 2 bdrm whose lease i could take over starting fall??????? please????????? Users/StephHolm

20090518 07:52:34 nbsp Can anyone comment on the closet space in the Jr. 2Bedroom aside from the walkin closet? Users/Pomona2006

20090814 16:53:30 nbsp I have lived at Stonegate for 3 years now and I LOVE it! I am in a smaller 1 bedroom. The first summer I lived there I had a huge PG&E bill due to the wall unit, but once they replaced all the units with the new energy efficient units and replaced all of my windows, my PG&E bill was cut by 3/4 and my apartment is even cooler now during the summer! I LOVE the manager Leana. She was crazy sharons assistant manager, but now she is the only one in the office. ANY type of maintenance issues, she is great about getting the maintenance (who are all FABULOUS as well) in the same day or by the next day! Crazy sharon would make up excuses and it would take weeks to get anything fixed in my apartment due to her forgetting to put in the request. Unfortunately the only downside of Stonegate is that it has been sold to a new owner! The new owner is Stonesfair management and they are HORRIBLE!!!! I lived at Greystone for 2 years and the manager there was just rude and was not very professional! I will not be renewing my lease for another year at Stonegate if Stonesfair brings in their people!!! Users/BigRob

20090821 20:37:13 nbsp What company do people use for Water/Garbage and Cable/Internet.. Just trying to get a feel for what is a good company to use? Users/JoeyKistler

20090903 12:21:25 nbsp I have a renovated D plan 2BR/2BA unit available for sublease from 9/20/098/31/10.  Top floor!  Raised ceilings + balcony.  Rent is only $1160 (+/ $5 depending on if you have a pet)cheaper than most D units due to the time I have lived there.  Please let me know if you are interested! Users/JenAndWinston

20091005 12:43:17 nbsp I love it here too, just moved in last month. its very quiet, altho i do hear all the afterparty students stumbling back toward arlington farms. but i find that all rather amusing LOL! my dog loves it, i love it. i sure hope they keep leanna and the crew, and that the new owner is good! my apt didnt get the new cabinetry it desperately needs, but except for that they redid everything and its great. Users/StephHolm

20091125 18:37:45 nbsp I am looking to sublease by 2 bedroom 2 bath apartment on the 2nd floor. I would like to move out December 15th but I am flexible. The lease goes to September 2010, and you get the old rate of $1145 a month! email me at clheath@ucdavis.edu Users/CrystalH

20100408 19:27:50 nbsp Weve been here several years and are sad to see how the new ownership, Stonesfair, has changed the business practices of this formerly fabulous property. Rent for 201011 was jacked up WAY beyond what these units are worth. Used to be a good deal, now just another Davis ripoff. Many longtime (read: quiet, conscientious) residents are moving out because they cant afford the new rates.

The office staff are friendly but the management team is negligent. We and several neighbors experienced severe leaking from our roof this winter, which caused visible water damage, falling plaster, and MOLD. Despite repeated phone calls and office visits, the problem wasnt addressed for four months, and even then all they did was paint over the damage.

Advice to future residents: As with most Davis landlords, be wary of Stonefairs business practices. Take photos/video of the property upon movein. Note any preexisting damages. Document your maintenance requests  when you placed the request and when it was fulfilled. When you move out, make sure to get an itemized list of deductions to your security deposit, and check that list with someone who can advise you about what a landlord can legally charge for damages.

Sorry to report that Stonegate is not the great complex it used to be! Talk with current residents to get their take before you sign a lease here.Users/DavisKid84



20100409 19:01:57 nbsp Im looking to sublease my two bedroom apt starting at the beginning of May. Its a great space. High ceilings in the living room, two bedrooms two bath on the second floor. The complex is quiet and pleasant. Ive loved living here. The place was renovated when we moved in two years ago. email me at christopher.stevens.phd@gmail.com if interested.  Users/clstevens

20100617 21:51:47 nbsp I lived here for 7 years (2002  2008), so while I cannot speak about the new management, I can recommend the complex. Overall: Quiet complex, lots of people with pets (dogs, cats, lizards, fish), and great units.  The pools and clubhouse are well maintained and good places to have gettogethers. Nice location in town, straight shot to campus down Russell Blvd.  Noise did tend to carry through the floor and walls. No assigned parking, so the lot can get full. Noise from the adjacent Arlington Farm complex carries, especially if youre in a bordering unit. Users/StevenWorker

20100926 20:52:43 nbsp DO NOT MOVE INTO STONEGATE VILLAGE APARTMENTS.

The apartments are nice, but the price that the new (corporate) management judges to be the fair market value is certainly no bargain.

And, beware of their policies.  I just moved out and was charged over $120 dollars of my deposit for a regular paint (I lived in the apartment for two years) and over $150 for a professional cleaning when the place was left extremely clean.  This is a first for me: I have lived in three different apartments in Davis and I have never had a cent deducted from any of my deposits.

Regarding the professional cleaning, corporate says that every apartment in California must be professionally cleaned and that this holds regardless of the condition upon departure (according to an onsight office person).  If that is their policy, you can count on handing them about $150 of your deposit automatically.  I doubt that this is legal and plan to seek legal counsel.  (What a hassle...  one more reason for the message in allcaps above.) Users/BuckeyeAggie

20110304 00:41:14 nbsp I like Stonegate, but as a veterinary student living in a unit bordering Arlington Farms, I wish that Arlington Farms would burn down.  Users/inu

20110406 12:12:50 nbsp I love living here. The new management has been very nice and I have had most of my problems fixed very quickly. They put in a new computer lounge/study area and a new equipment room is currently under construction. I live in a town house and do face Arlington Farms. With my window open it can be slightly noisy but otherwise I never hear a thing. The D & K bus lines come by very frequently and I found my new favorite pizza (Lamppost) right down the street. Rent is extremely cheap but the service has been excellent and I would recommend living here to anyone. Users/MattBrady

20110731 05:30:58 nbsp When I worked out a lease with them there werent any breed restrictions mentioned. Users/JennSka

20110905 09:28:55 nbsp Im moving in today and found out that although AT&Ts website indicates that we can get their internet service here, the management has said that AT&Ts packages that are worth getting (better than Comcast) are not available here because there would be a high installation cost to Stonegate that theyre not willing to pay. This is extremely frustrating because Comcast has been nothing but a pain from past experience and what Ive heard third hand. I wish Stonegate had been upfront about this when we were considering it as an option, we may have looked at other options where we could have better internet options. Buyer beware, especially considering its entirely within their power to make AT&T available here. Users/micseydel

20110919 18:10:06 nbsp RE: BuckeyeAggies complaint

I just dealt with the exact same rubbish as you.  I got charged 150 for a professional cleaning and 120 ish for painting for my apartment that was left very clean with very little/any wear whatsoever.  This was the first apartment complex Ive been charged a penny.

Very disappointing because the unit itself was nice, a 2nd story plan A, but the gouging on the security deposit leads me to not recommend leasing here.  If you do plan on living here, take meticulous photographs of the place showing its cleanliness/etc to fight being overcharged. Users/Strategiry

20120128 11:28:15 nbsp I have a first floor, junior 2 bedroom (2 bedrooms/1bath; 844 sq ft) apartment that will be available for sublease starting April 1, 2012.  It’s a quiet apartment with friendly neighbors, and easy access to parking and the bus lines (D & K).  Cats and dogs (up to 75 lbs) are welcome.  Please email me if interested: dedegroot@gmail.com Users/LizeeD

20120408 13:30:52 nbsp I believe I was told by the manager that they dont count small caged animals as part of the 3 pet limit, though you will want to verify the information before you fill your apartment with them as my room mate and I were getting tours of many apartments that day and all the information began to mesh together. If you plan to do any apartment hunting be prepared to make it a weekend excursion. Most of the places will give tours without an appointment from 10 am till 5 pm and estimate that it will be about 45 minutes per complex for every tour. I would also suggest you make a plan and a list of apartments from one end of Davis to the other, it will save time instead of running back and forth across town to view apartments.

20130831 11:40:46 nbsp We just moved out of this complex and loved it. The management is extremely nice and very helpful (and they didnt judge us for going into the leasing office barefoot in our pajamas to ask for quarters every few weeks).
