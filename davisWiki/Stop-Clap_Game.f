The StopClap Game is a fun game aimed to encourage drivers (and cyclists!) to respect Stop Signs stop signs a bit more.

Users/EBT first heard of this game from his friend Users/JamesBanks James Banks.

 How to Play 

 1. Gather up some buddies; the more, the merrier.
 2. Find a threeway intersection with stop signs on all directions. This part is crucial. If you don’t want to take the trouble of scouting the target location in person, http://maps.google.com/ Google StreetView is your friend.
 3. Situate yourselves at the top of the “T”
 4. Wait for a vehicle to come by!
 5. If the vehicle comes to a complete stop, cheer, holler, applause, clap, etc.
 6. But if the vehicle only slows down, or worse, Running Stop Signs ignores the stop sign, boo as loudly as you can to show your disapproval.
 7. Wait for another vehicle and repeat steps 5 or 6 as appropriate.

 Safety 

  Do not stand in the intersection. Incoming cars may strike you.
  Use handheld horns at your own risk. Some drivers may not take kindly to your feedback.
  If the vehicle does not stop, do not try to run after it. Chances are, you won’t catch up.
