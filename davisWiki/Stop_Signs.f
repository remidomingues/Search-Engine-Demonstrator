There are plenty of Stop Signs in town, but some people Running Stop Signs just don’t stop.

The http://www.dmv.ca.gov/pubs/hdbk/pgs17thru18.htm#trafficsigns California Driver Handbook has this to say about stop signs: Eightsided red STOP signs mean you must make a full stop whenever you see a STOP sign. Stop before entering a crosswalk or at a white “limit line” which is a wide white line painted on the street. If a crosswalk or limit line is not painted on the street, stop at the corner.

More information about http://www.dmv.ca.gov/pubs/hdbk/pgs16thru17.htm#intersections right of way at intersections, including those controlled by stop signs, can be found in the Handbook.

There is a difference between fourway stops, as seen mostly in down town, and twoway stops as seen bordering down town on more minor streets. There is an even bigger difference in a Cactuar Sign, as those have no jurisdiction over our roads. Some local signs have a Shark Finning secret activist agenda as well.

The Oregon Legislature is currently considering adoption of a law similar to one in Idaho that introduced what’s known today as the http://vimeo.com/4140910?pgembed&sec Idaho stop, which allows bicyclists to treat stop signs as yield signs. No word yet on if and when California or Davis will consider such a law. However, if it passes in Oregon, it may not be far off.

The stopclap game would not be possible without the existence of these noble landmarks.

  Maybe a list of all stop signs in Davis.  On second thought, thatd be just as tedious and repetitive as getting pictures of lots of stop signs.  Either would be cool to see, but I wouldnt want to do it. Users/BrettHall
