In Davis, like any other town, residents receive a mailbox full of Junk Mail ads and flyers.  Most of these never are read but instead are thrown away, or hopefully, recycled.  However, recently, virtually all stores have decided to put their ads online which helps you choose your store more stragically, especially if you are a Living Cheaply cheapskate trying to find a specific item at a low price.  These have the attractive feature of being able to search by keyword.  Whenever possible, the ads below link directly to the Davis ad.
