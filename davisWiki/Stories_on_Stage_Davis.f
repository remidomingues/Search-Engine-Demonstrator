Modeled on the successful Stories on Stage Sacramento series, Stories on Stage Davis aims to celebrate and share the remarkable writing and acting talent of Davis and the surrounding communities. The series features short fiction by established and emerging writers, introduced by their authors and read by actors.

The series, which is sponsored by the UC Davis Humanities Institute, is held at the Pence Gallery, 212 D Street, in downtown Davis, the second Saturday of every month, from 7:30pm to 9pm. Doors open at 7pm. Wine and light refreshments are available for purchase. Donation: $5. See the http://storiesonstagedavis.com/ Stories on Stage Davis homepage for information on upcoming events and bios of featured writers.

Stories on Stage Davis pays a small honorarium to the writers and actors they work with and is currently looking for both fiction to feature and actors to read. For fiction, short stories or standalone excerpts of novels, 3000 words or less, are preferred, but they will consider great stories up to 5000 words in length. While preference is given to authors living in Davis and surrounding areas, they are happy to look at great writing from anywhere.

Stories on Stage Davis is also accepting written resumes or video links from actors who are interested in reading and interpreting written works. Again, preference is given to local talent.

Submissions from both writers and actors can be uploaded at the http://storiesonstagedavis.com/?page_id6 submissions page at the Stories on Stage Davis website.
