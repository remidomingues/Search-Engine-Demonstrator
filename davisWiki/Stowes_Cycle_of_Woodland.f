Stowes Cycle sells and services all common makes of street, dirt, and cruiser motorcycles as well as quads, carts, etc. They have a showroom with accesories and parts, a large airconditioned shop for servicing bikes, and a back garage packed with used (and new?) bikes. Tim Sr. and Tim Jr. have many decades of experience fixing bikes.


20130703 21:07:08 nbsp I just had a really positive first experience bringing my 1984 street bike here to have the tires changed. They charged me a fair price and gave me some really helpful free advice on how to fix the carb problems I was having (but didnt want them to work on). These guys know what theyre doing.
