20090627 23:19:06 nbsp Ive been to the Strands in Sac and had good experiences with Kelly, but the location in Davis is so much more convenient for me so I decided to give it a try. I made an appointment for a cut and color after work (which is tricky because I dont get off until 5:30) and they were able to fit me in for an appointment at 5:45 (its a 2 hour appt.). I saw Amber, which I was nervous about after reading a negative review about her on the archived Tangles comments, but she was great! The color was easy (she used the formula on file from my previous visit) but she gave me the exact cut Ive been wanting (and after I gave her a really vague description too).

Amber is a perfectionist with her clients hair and didnt rush through styling mine even though it was past closing. After she was done she gave me a discount card for new clients that gives $20 off every service Strands offers the first time you try it. So not only did she charge me less than the Sac location, but I got $40 off that price too! I will definitely be back to see Amber and Id recommend her to friends too.

Oh  and she did offer me a head and shoulders massage, which was a wonderful and a really nice extra touch. Users/StephanieNuccitelli

20090803 14:05:08 nbsp Necole, the esthetician, is a perfectionist and an artiste. I adore her, and highly recommend her. Users/walkandbike

20091124 11:42:30 nbsp This was the worst hair experience of my life. I cheated on my normal hair lady to go here because I had a great haircut at strands about a year ago. I told Lily that I wanted an all over color and something less maintenance. She told me that low lights would be better and I said ok... Im no hair expert. She proceeded to put in some low lights and asked me if I wanted her to touch up the blonde, so I said ok. She bleached my roots. and the toner did nothing. My hair is DARK brown naturally I dont see how anyone would think that putting bleach all over my roots would be less maintenence, Im talking white blonde. The price was 120 i should have not paid but I didnt realize how bad it was until I got home.  They made me pay another 20 to fix it. I dont know what is wrong with these people, but DONT GO HERE!!!!!!! Also, My hair has a green tin, not to mention a really stupid looking layer of bleach that I will probably have for the next ten years.  Users/Ldish949

20091211 10:40:19 nbsp I hated my experience here.  I went because ULoop had 50% of first time service and I thought that this was a nice enough salon that they should be able to do a good job.  I was scheduled to see Amber and I have to agree with the person who left a comment about her on Tangles.  I dont think the listened to a thing I said.  When I go to my hairstylist at home, I give vague descriptions and she does an amazing job.  If I happen to have a picture with me, she makes my hair look exactly like the picture or she will tell me that it wont work.  A stylist working at Strands, a pricy salon, should have enough knowledge to be able run her hands through my hair and figure out my hair type.

I gave Amber a photo and picked out the colors to dye my hair myself. Once again, at home I kind of pick the colors I like and the hairstylist will pick what will go well and occasionally blends two colors for the best result.  Luckily, the colors I chose were 1, my roots (all she had to do was match it) and 2 a bright red and it came out fantastic (go me!).  Her professional opinion seemed nonexistant if I asked for it (something else I expect and told her I like from my hairstylist, grow a pair please). I realize now that I never received or were offered this complimentary head/neck massage but saw Lily give one to each of her clients.  I guess students with coupons are less valuable customers.  While shes cutting my hair she takes a lot off, but I figure she knows what she doing and just give her the go ahead. Wrong, hey Amber hair shrinks when it dries sarcastic gasp! When she dried my hair it looked awful, its this short notquitepixie shag thing that I hate.  Yes the photo I gave her was a short hair cut but not this boxy in the back (which will turn mullety) nor were the bangs supposed to be this short.  After being in shock I was told that it would cost $160 (yay for coupon making it 80). Not worth $160 for a haircut I hate that doesnt look like what I wanted. If it looked just like the picture and I still hated it, it wouldnt be her fault, but it doesnt so it is.

COUPON OR NOT, DO NOT GO HERE. Maybe they view people using a coupon as useless, poor, one time only clients.  If she had done a good job, I would go back, but I rather go back home. I guess I should be nice and state that the coloring job was good

EDIT: I went home to have the mess cleaned up and I wasnt crazy, she cut my hair unevenly. One side she cut evenly, the other she used the razor and feathered it out too much.  My hairdresser at home told me this and fixed it up the best she could (and shes not the type of hairdresser that gets snippy)

20100130 13:38:26 nbsp Had a cut/color with Amber.  Went to my Aveda salon at home and my normal stylist found bits of my hair that were uncut and told me that if I ever let her cut my hair again I was in trouble. Because Aveda requires training he said that if I requested their master stylist I should be fine. She also angled my highlights on the side of my head incorrectly aka not at all so that I was left with stripes for my natural highlights, which my normal stylist also had to repair.  However, she was nice, friendly, and cooperative and I do sincerly believe that she attempted to give me what I wanted, just not the most skilled person ever.  Recently revisited and had an asian woman, cant remember her name, that did a fantastic job! Users/5thAve

20100402 13:35:03 nbsp I absolutely love the customer service here! The girls at the welcoming desk are extremely accommodating and helpful! I am also a BIG fan of Aveda products and they have some of the best! Users/KaraMc

20100504 21:50:37 nbsp I didnt like the salon too much either, but John is simply amazing. Im a picky person when it comes to hair and have been traveling great distances for a haircut and color. Not any longer, he did an amazing job!  Users/mm

20100714 22:05:27 nbsp after two times of service  I like this place, I had been the girl who never paid more than $15 on a hair cut but they have done a good job.  The first time I went to Lily and I really liked her, she didnt leave forwarding information but I got a good hair cut the second time I went as well.  I like the massage, wash and free iced tea!  Aveda products smell great. Users/BamCam

20110219 20:10:40 nbsp Im currently growing out my hair, and I have been putting off getting a trim for quite some time now, because Ive had many bad experiences where too much hair would be cut off.  After reviewing all the salons in Davis with DavisWiki and Yelp, I decided to go with Strands.  I do not regret my decision.  My stylist was Janette and she did a wonderful job giving me an all around trim.  She even finished it off with curling my and put in this serum that made my hair smell absolutely AMAZING. I could not wait to show off my new hairstyle!!! And whats best, I walked in prepared to pay $4550 for the cut, but she only charged me $40!!! Janette was very friendly, and gave me an awesome neck/shoulder massage right when I sat in the chair. I highly recommend Janette!!! Users/ChocolateFrogs

20110611 19:59:17 nbsp I went there a week and a half ago to get light brown highlights to my natural dark/medium brown hair. I specifically asked for no blond to be put in.  I currently have bleach blond highlights in my hair, and it looks far from natural. Users/MLKt

20120808 10:46:06 nbsp I have been going to Strands aka Tangles on and off for several years and lately have been seeing Joy, who is great. She is skilled and she takes the time to do exactly what you want and is very precise. Its a little pricey, but Ive always gotten really nice cuts and highlights here. I tend to go for pretty basic lowmaintenance styles but still always get lots of compliments on my hair after getting it cut here.  Users/PhoebeAyers
