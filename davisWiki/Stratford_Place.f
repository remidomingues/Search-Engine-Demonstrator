20101111 18:05:13 nbsp Question..do most apartment complexes provide microwaves? If so, then I must have been ripped off 4 times already! Users/Babhari

20110216 00:49:43 nbsp Anybody have any feedback on this place? My partner and I are looking at twobedrooms for the fall. Comments on layout, management, noise, etc? Users/MeggoWaffle

I lived at Stratford for a year. I loved the location but there were a few drawbacks. Its freezing in the winter and boiling in the summer. Our apartment would often be 100 degrees in the summer and the central air did nothing. The landlords dont want to fix stuff so dont hold your breath if youre waiting on them. They can also be a bit abrasive. Despite all this I loved the price and the location. Id definitely consider moving back if I needed to.  Users/serafina

20110905 04:46:27 nbsp Does the rent include any utilities or other amenities?  Users/DavisAugs

20130826 14:42:22 nbsp This place is cold at winter and hot at summer, especially when you are in second floor. And you can hear the neighbors very clearly at night. The women manager talks like you own her a lot of money and she is very persist in what she wants you to do. There is nothing you can negotiate with her. Her husband is nicer than her. Not recommend living there.  Users/MichelGong
