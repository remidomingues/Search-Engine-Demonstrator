The following is excerpted from the City of Davis website

 The City of Davis Street Tree Program officially began in 1963 with the establishment of the Tree Commission Street Tree Committee.  Prior to 1963, developers were encouraged to plant a tree in the parkway in subdivisions which, in most cases, the City assumed as street trees.  The purpose of the program initially was to provide shade and aesthetics for our community, which remains the primary concern. The program has contributed to the property values throughout town.

 Currently, the City of Davis City maintains about 13,000 street trees, and over 5,000 trees in parks and greenbelts.  Maintenance includes everything from the original planting, to pruning, integrated pest management, replacement, and keeping current on the latest care and control methods. Street trees are now designated only after consideration of growth rates, required maintenance, size, and environment.

 In 1977, the City received national recognition for our Street Tree Program by the National Arbor Day Foundation.  We have continued to received this annual award, and are known nationally as a Tree City USA.

The citys Street Tree List can be found at the City of Davis web site under Urban Forestry.
