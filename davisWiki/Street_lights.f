There are roughly 6,000 street lights within the City of Davis. Most are highpressure sodium bulbs, but the city is in the process of replacing the old street lights with power efficient LED lights.
Street lights in Davis have hoods on them preventing light from uselessly going up into the sky and causing wiki:wikipedia:light pollution.  Despite confusion, this is the only requirement upon them, and theres no lack of them due to the light ordinance.

 LED Controversy 

Some residents are upset with the quality of the new LED lights. Claiming they are obnoxiously bright and produce unnatural looking shadows. The City contends they are on a frequency that doesnt strain your eyes, use a lot less power, dont require expensive ballasts, and last the city a minimum of four times longer.
Change isnt sodium orange, its brilliant white. Besides dont worry there is a group that does research into lighting on 2nd Street and Spafford Street (they pioneered them) and they are aware of the brilliance.

My only complaint about the new lights is they look like xenon/HID headlights from around blind corners. The trick is to realize that they are static & not a moving car. That being said Im extremely pleased to see the sodium vapor bulbs finally get the boot.  ~SD
