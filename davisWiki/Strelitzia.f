20090228 14:01:58 nbsp Hi there. Usually photos are left on the Wiki page for historical reasons; and photos should never be deleted entirely, which may have happened if you tried to replace Strelitzia.jpg directly. Ive tried to enlarge the new pic you posted to no avail. Thanks for posting it. Users/robinlaughlin

20100630 12:17:10 nbsp A lot of us arent happy that some people want those accusations of racism to stay. There was a big debate over at {{{Strelitzia Flower Co/Talk}}} that unfortunately didnt go anywhere. Im going to delete the comments in question and hope the people who want to let it stay will let it go, but I make no guarantees. Im sorry you had to deal with this! Users/WilliamLewis
