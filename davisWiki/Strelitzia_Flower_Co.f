Strelitzia is a 40yearold family owned Florists florist,  which also operates a shop in Woodland Woodland at 400 Court Street. They have a good assortment of readymade arrangements and loose flowers, in addition to pottery, plants, balloons, basket gardens, greeting cards, stuffed animals, vases, gift items, and silk flowers. Strelitzia has always been voted Best Florist in Yolo County and recently received an honorable mention as the best Independent retailer in Yolo County. We offer the freshest flowers available and also carry the largest inventory of flowers around.

A unique feature of the Davis store is its large work area located behind the cash registers, where staff create flower arrangements in full view of customers. Prior to their move they were located downtown at 238 G Street. They moved to a new facility at 4614 Second Street on July 1st, 2008. In conjunction with the move they are introducing wholesale pricing on all cut flowers.

20110825 21:01:28 nbsp We just had our wedding flowers done here. I was very happy with them. I didnt have pictures to share with the staff member I met with, so just described what I wanted. They were beautiful! And they charged me just $30 to delivery in south Sacramento from Davis. They were there exactly on time and were very nice.  Users/CeliaSepulveda

20120114 18:42:47 nbsp This place really SUCKS if you are looking to buy whole sale flowers. I gave them 4 weeks notice to get a bunch of flowers for my wedding reception. They raised the price on me after I placed my order. Then they didnt even get me the correct color of daisies, the stems of everything were scrawny and weak, and all the alstermeria were wilted when I got my order. I dont know if they use better quality in their own arrangements but I personally will Never buy from them again. Users/Kaleigh

20120605 19:53:12 nbsp The flowers are beautiful here, BUT the people were quite rude and condescending to me when it became apparent that I was not looking to spend hundreds of dollars.  A sale is still a sale, even if it is small!     Users/RKor

20120817 08:06:38 nbsp WOW. I wanted to send my girlfriend some little flower arrangement at work just to brighten her day a little, but there is literally nothing in their entire inventory that fits a reasonable persons budget. The cheapest flower arrangement they even offer, at least in the make someone smile category, was $37, plus $11 wire fee to purchase online, and an $11 delivery fee yup, $60 for the cheapest possible option. Sure, if I were planning to propose, Id drop that and more. If this were an anniversary, no problem (although Id definitely shop around first). But if youre just looking to do something nice, and you are living on a student budget or low income, forget about it.

I thought Id share in case this comment saved someone a few minutes of searching and disappointment. Users/AndrewWaymire

When we purchase flowers from our growers prices are always subject to change. Just like at a grocery store apples will be on special one week and not the next. We can never guarantee that the prices or availability will be exact every week. We do our best to locate flowers at the best quality and price. Sometimes we will have to purchase flowers from growers with higher prices to make sure we provide the correct colors and quantities. We always let our customers know of changes as soon as we know.
We have customers with all types of budgets and we do our best to accommodate everyone. We offer wholesale flowers to the public and we have a minimum of $36 for delivery ($25 arrangement + $11 delivery). When placing an order if you do not see something you like or within your budget you can all us direct and one of our sales staff can help create a custom arrangement.
If anyone has proplems in the future please call our Davis location (530)7585050 and ask to speak with management. We appreciate all feedback and are always looking for ways to improve and keep our customers happy. Users/StrelitziaFlowerCompany
