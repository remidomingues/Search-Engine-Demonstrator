The Stride for Aggie Pride is a 5K run in Davis geared toward students, though nonstudents are encouraged to participate as well. According to the UC Davis Stride for Pride website:

The Stride for Pride is a philanthropic effort by students and the campus community featuring a 5K run/walk open to participants of all ages. The course runs through the Arboretum and other notable campus locations ensuring an enjoyable route filled with Aggie spirit. This event aims to encourage a healthy lifestyle with a focus on student holistic health, particularly mental and physical wellness. All proceeds from this event go to We Are Aggie Pride and the ASUCD Endowment Fund; both programs are geared towards helping students in financial need. Various local businesses and campus departments have banded together to show support and are present at the event with booths and handson activities. Live music, performances by student groups, awesome prize drawings open to all participants and much more.
