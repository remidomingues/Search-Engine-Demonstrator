The purpose of StudentLed Education (SLED) is to guide undergraduates through the process of teaching their own university courses. Its already possible to teach courses on this campus a handful of students have been through the process already. But unless youre unusually savvy, its difficult to make it through the entire process on youre own. We exist to mentor students who have an idea of something they would like to teach from concept to classroom.

We serve students interested in facilitating their own course, and faculty who are interested in finding student instructors to support and mentor.

Over a given quarter, SLED performs three functions:

Training
  Orientation and information sessions to introduce students to the process
  Workshops and office hours to guide students through the idea generation
  Handouts and informational material to organize your plan

Resources
  Vouchers for printing copies free of charge (available Fall 2011)
  Directory of contacts for professors for sponsoring
  Grantwriting assistance
  Website for organizing course offerings each quarter, new and archived

Support
  Working with course facilitators and faculty sponsors during teaching
  Classroom observations, evaluations, and feedback
  Conflict resolutions (if need be)

This is a tentative packet because its taken from UC Berkeleys version of the program:http://www.decal.org
(But well only be changing the resources listed, so its still worth filling out.)

If you want to teach a course Fall 2011, here are the steps you need to follow:

BEFORE SPRING 2011 IS OVER
 1. Come up with an idea, see http://www.decal.org/courses/ DECal for examples. Fill out the brief course interest form https://spreadsheets.google.com/embeddedform?formkeydHNERkZ6MWZ1MEpqNmtIc2p3cHA5M2c6MQ here.
 2. Find friends who you would want to teach with (or go lonewolf) and professors who could sponsor you
 3. Approach all of these individuals (especially the professor) and begin working on a syllabus.

BEFORE FALL 2011 BEGINS
 4. Your professor and department chair must both approve the syllabus as either a 98 or 198 course.
 5. Complete the packet and turn it in to us.

 Tips, Tricks, & Sage Advice 

Types of Courses (This is not an exhaustive list, but a springboard for ideas)
  Seminars: Invite guest speakers each week, course goes through several topics relating to a theme)
  Project courses: The outcome of your course is a product, like a journal publication or performance,
  Guide courses: The course is a support/resource group, like PreLaw 101 or Getting Involved on Campus
  Media study: You course applies academic consideration to a prominent cultural trend (like Jersey Shore, Harry Potter, Family Guy, Hipsters)

Finding a sponsoring professor (in order of importance)
 1. Reach out to a professor that knows and likes you
 2. Find a professor that has been here longer (Lecturer<Assitant Prof<Associate Prof<Distinguished Prof) because he or she will be more experienced, and has a stronger chance of getting your proposal by the Department  Chair. Bonus points if your professor IS the Department Chair.
 3. Find a professor with experience in your area of interest
