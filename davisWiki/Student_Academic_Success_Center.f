Undergraduates are usually shy about going to the LSC, but their usefulness should not be underestimated. They are skilled at helping students with a broad range of academic success and experience. For writing skills, they can help you effectively communicate your thoughts in papers, as well as help you understand what professors are looking for in papers and essay exams.

  In economics, the math tends to be calculus based and in the case of econometrics, statistics based. Just remember the LSC helps with calc and stats, so they may be able to help you understand your econ! Im sure this is true for other subjects as well!  Users/JessicaRockwell

20070810 10:11:08 nbsp This place is especially great for students who cant make office hours or students who are to shy to ask basic questions in office hours (often office hours can be intimidating, and this is a great resource if your professor is on the intimidating side) Users/MattHh

20071015 22:06:44 nbsp LSC is the way to go! Although it is open to all majors, most of the courses that offer tutoring and workshops are catered towards biology major requirements. If youre doing Chem2 series, definitely take the workshops. The professionals there highlight key concepts and go over practice problems. The tutoring services are done by Undergraduate tutors so results may vary depending on their competency in both subject material and teaching ability, but so far Im impressed. If you want to get As in your classes, definitely sign up because it helps tremendously. Free and convenient too. Dont miss out or youll regret it. Im serious! Make the most out of your tuition, education, and future and just freakin go. AND DO IT NOW. Users/soohoo

20071102 00:59:00 nbsp I love the LSC. Their tutoring services are great, although if you go to dropin for Math help during peak hours (10  12), there will probably be 1 tutor for about 15+ people and it takes a poopload of time for them to get to you. But what can you expect; its free. Definitely take advantage of it though. Users/kthrnngo
  I especially recommend going 910am or Fridays 45pm. Those tend to be almost empty (14 students).

20090126 21:46:34 nbsp I wish they had tutors for courses other than English, Math, and the Sciences. It would be cool if they had tutoring for Econ or Linguistics per say.   Users/BryceH

20120501 23:30:17 nbsp is the SASC open during summer? Im taking part of the Ochem series over summer and would really love to get free tutoring over summer.  Users/JenniferNguyen

 Call SASC 7523000 and ask them about summer schedulingthen post hereSASC functions best with user input.  Alternatively, go now and get regular chem learned solidly, which will help you understand Ochem easier.  Dont forget to go to TA/Prof office hours for help; theyre also free resources.  Best ochem tip: practice drawing chemical structures.  Theyre critical in ochem notetaking.  Learning the names of functional groups is superimportant too.  Ochem really requires art, visualization, and language skills  Users/JudithTruman


20120114 nbsp does the SASC offer tutoring services for courses such as Foreign Languages or Politics? Users/MichelleNguyen
