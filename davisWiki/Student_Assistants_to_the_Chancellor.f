The http://sac.ucdavis.edu Student Assistants to the Chancellor bridge the gap between students and the UCD Administration University administration.  They interact with students and administrators in order to help make UC Davis an open environment for all students.  They assist students with problems and concerns, and also advise the administration on student life and issues.  In an effort to build bridges, they organize discussions between administrators and students, and we also collaborate and cosponsor programs throughout the year.
