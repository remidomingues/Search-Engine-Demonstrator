The Student Bill of Rights was a ASUCD Constitution constitutional amendment that was passed during the Winter 2004 ASUCD election, although some might consider that time period wiki:drama:At least 100 years ago a while back. It was an issue that Student Focus used to build support during the days of Sara Henry.  It basically enumerated rights that ASUCD members already had, and gave it ASUCD Constitution constitutional status in order to promote the nowdefunct ASUCD Student Advocacy Office Student Advocacy unit.

The person designated as the head of the pro campaign was Kalen Gallagher, who was also the ASUCD President presidential candidate during the same Winter 2004 ASUCD election election. The person designated as the head of the con campaign was Paul Amnuaypayoat. Images of the con campaigns fliers are below. The measure passed with roughly 80% of the voters approval.


After its passage, it was promptly forgotten by almost everyone and SGAO lost all copies.

On February 2, 2006 Rawi Nanakul, an ASUCD Senate Winter 2006 ASUCD Election/Senate Candidates candidate, filed an ASUCD Court case on the basis that Constitutional Amendments should be added to the Constitution.  In his press release, he alleges complete abandonment by ASUCD and Student Focus, but Chris Herold had already looked up the minutes to IAC and Senate and was working on reconstrucing the bill prior to this.

In the end, the ASUCD Court managed to find a copy of and attached it to the http://www.geocities.com/winged_snail/dcmnt/supcor3204b.doc official opinion on Case #32.  Its actually easy to see why it was forgotten in the first place.


20060203 20:18:16 nbsp Reconstructing? What about simply finding what the students had already voted for and putting copies of it inside of the SGAO? Someone has to have it somewhere... Users/PaulAmnuaypayoat

20060204 00:40:47 nbsp If you have a copy of it, please post.  Otherwise, were going to have to work with a reconstruction. Users/BrentLaabs

20060204 01:59:44 nbsp Are you serious Brent? Someone from Focus has to have it somewhere... Can we contact Sara Henry? Users/PaulAmnuaypayoat

20060204 02:09:42 nbsp Of course Im serious Paul.  Chris Herold had a copy from before the bill was introduced, and he seems to have found the amendments made in the minutes.  If you can contact Henry or KG to see if they have a copy, I suggest you do so. Users/BrentLaabs

20060313 20:51:33 nbsp Can I say this bill of rights is ridiculous.... it has absolutely no power over almost everything it proclaims.....  Users/JamesSchwab

20060313 23:22:29 nbsp Yes James, go ahead and say it. Thats why I fought against it... but the Focites won that round. Users/PaulAmnuaypayoat
