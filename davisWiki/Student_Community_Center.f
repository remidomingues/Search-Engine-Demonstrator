 History 

Students voted to assess themselves a fee of $13.00/quarter in order to build the Student Community Center.  During the planning phase and early construction, it was known as the Student Resource Center.

The building was originally planned to have basic LEED certification.  In 2006, CalPIRG and the California Student Sustainability Coalition campaigned to have the building built to LEED Platinum certification.  The campaign collected 1,200 petitions.  They also wrote an ASUCD Senate resolution (SR11 in Winter 2006), which passed unanimously.  Eventually, they convinced the administration to build a LEED Platinum SRC, though funding and a number of other road blocks caused the project to fall one certification level short and is now seeking http://www.siegfriedeng.com/projects/UC_Davis_Student_Community_Center.shtml LEED Gold status.



20100301 20:11:59 nbsp Great, more student fees spent on stuff I will never use.  Users/hankim
  But you frequently used the Temporary Buildings that the Center is replacing, right? Users/SRB
   So lets spend a bunch of money to replace a few buildings that I never use with another building Ill never use. Strong logic. Users/hankim
    I never used the ARC, whether the money came out of my tuition or not. Many people never use Unitrans, either. You pay into the system, and you get services out. Users/thedrdonna
      And I disagree with how the school funds the ARC and Unitrans as well.  Users/hankim
       Fair enough. I gradumated but still live in town, so I use the SCC without paying a red cent. On the other hand I finished up right before it was built, so Im sure plenty of my tuition went toward its construction. Users/thedrdonna
          Yep your money did. Same thing happened when the ARC was built. A bunch of students who would never see it completed paid for it. That should not happen with a gym. Pretty sure 24 Hour Fitness would never go into a town, force everyone (including those who dont want it there or dont care for a gym) there to pay for it and then build the gym. Its crap like this that pisses me off about UC Davis. Users/hankim

20120309 21:00:44 nbsp This should be linked to the Campus Buildings Wiki(http://daviswiki.org/Campus_Buildings), but I dont know how.   Users/HeatherKeck
   There is no Campus Buildings Wiki, just the Campus Buildings page on the Davis Wiki.  :)   I added a link from the Student Community Center page to the Campus Buildings page and vice versa; I think thats what you wanted.  The code to link to a page looks like this:  {{{Campus Buildings}}}.   Users/CovertProfessor

20120509 00:29:35 nbsp The CoHo here could be better. Last quarter they consistently opened 1015 minutes late, wasnt set up to punch my CoHo card (is a hole punch THAT technologically advanced?), and possibly got the dark/decaf roasts mixed up as I fell asleep fifteen minutes after drinking the dark French roast and sometimes felt superwired.

20120513 17:10:54 nbsp I feel that having this building built is a great investment, even though my tuition went up because of this...But hey, what am I going to do. That why I go here a lot. I mean the library is always full and doesnt have a lot of plugs for laptops unlike the S.C.C. where there are plugs nearly EVERYWHERE! Theres a whole bunch of centers in this place too, cant remember them all but I do remember going to the Undergraduate Research center and they helped me find a professor to do research for. Theres A.C. when its ridiculously hot outside and keeps you nice and dry when its raining outside. They close pretty late and they have the study lounge open for quite a while too. Great place to go other than the library or the 24 to study or just to hang out with friends. I cant believe they let us eat in there, I always feel bad but its great to know I can go inside one of these buildings to eat, hang out and study all at the same time. Users/JaceWinter
