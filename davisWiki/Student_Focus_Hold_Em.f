Sick of getting an obscene amount of flyers on your door? Was your flyer to resident ratio more than 3:1?  Instead of throwing them away, why not make a Drinking games drinking game? Thats what some residents of Tanglewood did! This is really a do it yourself game, so Im sure there are plenty of variations out there. Other versions such as Friends Urging Campus Kindness F.U.C.K. Hold Em and L.E.A.D. Hold Em may exist as well.

Materials

  Several Student Focus flyers
  Magic Marker
  Alcohol

Instructions

Start with your deck of Student Focus playing cards. Randomly draw from the stack, assign however many drinks to each card as you please, drink that number.

  P  Sapana and Jenni, because they are running for ASUCD President and Vice President.
  PD  Ami Vora, because she is the Picnic Day chair
  V  Kai SavareeRuess because he is a Welcome Week Volunteer, as well as the Academic Affairs Vice Chair
  CYu  Cindy Yu
  Xi  Kale Jenks, because hes in Theta Xi
  SOS  Ari Kalfayan because he was the SOS President

Here is an example deck of cards.


Disclaimer
This game is all in good fun, it is simply an alternative to throwing stuff away and making more garbage. Similar games can be made from L.E.A.D. or Friends Urging Campus Kindness F.U.C.K. flyers as well. It is meant as a joke, so please dont take it too seriously.
