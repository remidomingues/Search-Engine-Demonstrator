The Student Government Administrative Office (SGAO) takes care of all paperwork, copying and sorting for ASUCD. You can find all public records regarding past elections, ASUCD Senate senate office hours, minutes, and legislation here in SGAO.

The SGAO office is also where potential ASUCD Senate candidates pick up their petitions as well as turn them in. Candidates also turn in all their paperwork during the campaign to the SGAO office.

SGAO used to be responsible to the Student Government Advisor and is managed by Office Coordinator Rachel Bingham.
The Office Coordinator now has full control of SGAO.  Users/PaulHarms Paul Harms, former Internal Affairs Commission Chair, also works in the office.

They now assist the Student Government Advisor in enforcing Bylaws, especially the AdoptAUnit Act authored by Paul Harms.

They also hire the ASUCD Recorder ASUCD Recorders.
