Has anyone tried using VOIP (Vonage, AT&T CallVantage, etc) in one of the university dorms or apartments? Please let us know your experience. In my opinion, VOIP is cheaper and better than the traditional phone line. — Users/AllenDahili
   I know a few people who use Skype, and it seems to work in the dorm without any problems. —Users/LeonardMarque

My experience with this organization has been such that I no longer hold it to be a competent policing agency.  Yes, I was kicked out for inappropriately manipulating fire in the dorm.  However, its wellknown that residents continue to break rules which have the potential for much more dire consequences (e.g. possessing and firing b.b. guns in the dorms, excessively drinking in the dorms), and that resident advisors (most commonly, the residents own RA) turn a blind eye to these infractions.  What really chaps my ass, though, is a series of events that happened today.  The premise: I have a meal contract with University Dining, a separate entity from Student Housing.  Today dinner was a special barbeque, held outside of the Tercero Residence Halls Tercero and Segundo Residence Halls Segundo dorms.  I, wanting to enjoy this special meal with my friends from the dormitory, chose to eat at the Tercero event, which was held on Leach Hall Leach Beach.  While eating, my friends noticed an area RA mugging my old roommate (who also got kicked out) and me, and later conversing with one of the adult, fulltime Student Housing staff members.  After we had disposed of our garbage, the adult Coordinator approached my roommate and me, pulled us aside, and questioned us as to what we were doing in the area, saying, I just wanted to make sure you werent doing anything that would land you in trouble and other such nonsense.  This person was in possession of the mental processes necessary to deduce that we were within our rights to be in the area, given that dinner was being held there tonight.  However, I am left brooding over the following qualms:

  Why didnt the RA who originally noticed us, not confront us directly over the matter?
  Moreover, even taking into account that current RA training methods may be inadequate, is it that difficult for an RA to realize that it is physically impossible for a student to not be in a dormitory area, when a meal from University Dining is to be served there?

Based on my overall experience with Student Housing, it does not seem unreasonable to me, to doubt the organizations competency in consistently training staff that are able at their job of advising residents.  Rather, it seems as if many staff members simply strive to shine a positive light on themselves, through enforcing rules over all residents except their home floors, and blindly turning trivia into issue with their superiors, disregarding a trait they should, as advisors and leaders, use at all times: logic. — Users/LeonardMarque
 When your housing contract was terminated, so was your meal plan. You should have gotten a prorated refund for the unused remainder of your meal plan. Furthermore, youre messing around with fire and they kick you out. Theyre wrong for that? Kindly DIAF. Tegwin puts up with enough of this type of crap.  Users/WilliamLewis
  Following my housing contract termination I was directed, by Student Housing, to obtain a separate meal contract with University Dining.  For the majority of this year Ive been eating meals at the Tercero, Segundo, and Cuarto Dining Commons without any problems. I do not question Student Housings judgement in kicking me out rather, I question RAs motivations in selectively enforcing rules. Kindly read more closely that which you comment on, and while youre at it, dont groundlessly wish harm upon others.  Also: I can only wish Id talked to the Gwin Reaper shes an angel compared to http://sja.ucdavis.edu/aboutsja.html Courtney.  Users/LeonardMarque
