Especially in tough economic times or policy disagreements, it is important to remember the many opportunities for student influence on and off campus. Although many of these avenues are merely advisory, subject to higher approval or diluted by nonstudent votes or representation, hopefully students will take advantage of these opportunities  however limiting.

20090929 11:12:21 nbsp 60,000 full time residents with 15,000 students heaped on top of that

how many bother to reregister in yolo? Ive heard the student vote drum beat before, but I will personally be amazed if someone can motivate them to actually turn out. Such an elusive demographic! Users/StevenDaubert

20090929 11:24:43 nbsp so is it 75,000??? isnt the official city population something around 60,000? I seriously doubt that when the census people come around that theyd exclude students or skip apartments, itd just be too hard. The exact number of students who live in the city is hard to determine precisely but its in the ballpark of 15,000 which means that students potentially consist of at least 25% of the voting population (have to exclude the under 18 people included in the 60,000 figure).  Users/StevenLee
 Students are seasonal, therefore not included in the population. Anyone in the dorms isnt in Davis anyways. Sure, they potentially consist of a decent fraction, but best of luck motivating them, removing the apathy, and getting them to pause their studies for local town politics that matter sooo much to them when the graduate and move on....

       I always wonder why people think of the dorms first  arent they mostly for first years only? Anyway, Segundo+Tercero+Cuarto house less than 5,000 people. users/edwins ES
 I have heard 6065K, with ~30K of those being students.  (See http://facts.ucdavis.edu/general_statistics.lasso for student numbers and http://cityofdavis.org/aboutdavis/cityprofile/index.cfm?topicpopulation for Davis overall).  And by the way, great idea for a page!  Go students!   Users/CovertProfessor
