The Student Nutrition Association (SNA) is one of two nutritionrelated clubs on campus. They were formerly known as the Nutrition and Dietetics Association, but that was so long ago that no student at UC Davis UCD can actually remember when that was.

SNA believes that good nutrition, including a well balanced diet and regular physical activity, is the foundation for health and development. For over 50 years SNA has served the UC Davis campus community promoting this concept.

The Student Nutrition Association serves as a link to academic, social, and community resources for those interested in nutrition and health. Membership is open to any who wish to join. Members receive information, support, food (at the meetings), a discount on tshirts, free or discounted admission for club events, and something to put on resumes and applications. All this for only $15 a quarter, or $25 for the whole year! If you want to know more, have any questions, or just like to send emails, we can be reached at MailTo(snaucd AT gmail DOT com)

Recruitment for new members will begin again starting Winter Quarter!

We participate in community service, social networking, and the Davis Farmers Market.

It is a shining example of a print newsletter in online electronic form, with all the benefits of being electronic: always accurate, instantly available worldwide, instantly editable/amendable by anyone anywhere anytime, clear text, bright color photos, hypertext links, low cost. All credit (as far as I know) belongs to Users/AnnaJones, who maintains this for use by her club and everyone interested. She gets IT. This is the best vision of the future, right here.
