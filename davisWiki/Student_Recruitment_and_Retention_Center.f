Our Mission
The Student Recruitment & Retention Center stands for educational equity. Our studentrun and studentinitiated programs foster holistic academic and personal development while raising political and cultural awareness thus empowering students to act as dynamic leaders for their communities. We accept the challenge of creating a society that provides a quality, culturally sensitive, comprehensive education for students of all backgrounds. Furthermore, we are dedicated to creating an environment of collective action that will work to ensure the perpetuity of academic achievement among future generations.
