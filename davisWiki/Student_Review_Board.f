Student Review Board is an organization within Student Housing that deals with violations of student housing policy. Each board consists of students living within the Residence Halls residence halls or other housing complexes managed by student housing. Area conduct coordinators can choose which cases they deal with themselves and which ones they desire to send to SRB. They mostly deal with noise and alcohol policy violations.

If you see these guys too many times, they might just send you to Student Judicial Affairs. Dont go there.
