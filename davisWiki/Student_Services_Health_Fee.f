This was student passed initiative, to pay for services and help fund Cowell Student Health Center.

This grew out of the sunset clause in the Student Services Maintenance Fee as funding for the Student Activities and Services Initiative Fee did not include any fees for the student health center.  This was to some degree an advantage since many people voted for the previous initiative since even though they opposed funding UCD Athletics they wanted to keep cheap health care available.

It may have been on the same ballot as the Student Activities and Services Initiative Fee, but it passed with a higher margin since low cost health care is always a popular program.
