 Users/CristinaDeptula Cristina Deptula: Ive been writing creatively on and off my whole life, ever since my first constructionpaper books at age three or four.

Ive also done some scientific and technical writing for the Aggie, which I hope to do professionally for bread and butter while I continue my literary stuff.
