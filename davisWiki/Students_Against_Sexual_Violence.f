Students Against Sexual Violence hopes to raise awareness about sexual violence in order to lower incidences of assault throughout campus.

They team up with Men Acting Against Rape and Campus Violence Prevention Program to put on Women Take Back the Night.  They also give presentations for campus groups, departments, and dorms about sexual assault.
