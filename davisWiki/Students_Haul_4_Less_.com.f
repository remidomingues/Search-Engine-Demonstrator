Students Haul 4 Less .com was a garbage and Hauling Services junk pickup and disposal service with the motto Tomorrows leaders haul your junk today!  They were UC Davis students who pledged to haul your junk for cheap and to work hard to keep your business.

With a simple two step process, you asked for a free estimate, and then the students arrived on time, gave a quote, and did all labor and cleaned up.  They beat competitors quotes by 20%, and were in the process of being licensed and insured.

They took all junk to the Yolo County Central Landfill
