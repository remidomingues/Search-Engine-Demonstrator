Students for Concealed Carry on Campus (SCCC) is a nonpartisan, national grassroots organization comprised of over 36,000 members. The majority of members are students (~90%), as well as faculty members, parents, and concerned citizens across the nation who support the right of concealed handgun license holders to carry concealed guns handguns on UC Davis college campuses.

The California Aggie featured http://theaggie.org/article/2371 an article on the organization: Concealed weapons at UC Davis? Looks unlikely.  There was a http://theaggie.org/article/2415 followup editorial: Concealed weapons on campus: Unwise and Dangerous.  The OpEd column And then I found 5 dollars also ran a http://theaggie.org/article/2050 satire about the idea.

Concealed carry is the legal authorization for private citizens to carry a concealed licensed handgun or other such weapon in public. According to Wikipedia, nine states have may issue or discretionary issue laws requiring the applicant to demonstrate specific need. These may issue states range from shall issue in practice .... to at the whim of local officials, such as New York, Massachusetts, and California (where rural officials more liberally issue permits but urban officials seldom do).

According to the statistics of Californias http://ag.ca.gov/firearms/statistics.php Attorney General, there are currently fewer than 250 people in Yolo County licensed to be able to carry a concealed handgun, a steady decrease since the late 1980s (approximately 500/600).  Specific numbers: 2002: 309 2003: 284 2004: 275 2005: 280 2006: 266  2007: 244.  None of these licenses extend to campus grounds.

This group wishes for concealed carry status to extend to UC Davis campus grounds for the sake of personal safety.  A lengthy discussion of this topic by wiki users was moved Students for Concealed Carry on Campus/Discussion to here.

Objectives include:
  To educate the public about the facts of concealed carry and dispel the many myths about concealed carry.
  To push state legislatures and school administrations to grant concealed handgun license holders the same right to carry concealed handguns on college campuses that these license holders currently enjoy at most other places (movie theaters, office buildings, shopping malls, banks, and so on).
  Current and future plans are to expand both SCCC awareness and membership among http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid72550455408 UCD students.

For some legal information, here is a bit of http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgibin/waisgate?WAISdocID23438811887+4+0+0&WAISactionretrieve California Penal Code Sections 1205012054, governing concealed weapon carry. As mentioned above, it is difficult to get a concealed firearm license in urban California. More specific to Davis, one can check http://www.cityofdavis.org/cmo/citycode/detail.cfm?p27&q1089 Davis Municipal Code Section 27.03.03, governing possession of firearms.

20111030 10:28:23 nbsp First learn how a fucking bunsen burner works THEN lets discuss a gun.  But not before you know what a mole is.  Go learn how to calculate a mole and convert that into milligrams/weight. . .AND THEN come bitch to me about how you want a concealed carry permit.

But not before!   If you need help, I suggest you first take a class with Dr. Mark Kurth of organic chemistry fame! Users/AshleyHamidi

20130612 03:05:48 nbsp I do not support this. I find it frightening. I believe that mental illness should be taken into account for any potential problem regarding an inaccurate decision. I know I havent read any of this, the comments, but I just find it amusing that a person who has logged into students for disabilities would also promote concealed carry of a weapon on campus.
