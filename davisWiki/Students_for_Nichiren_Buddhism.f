Students for Nichiren Buddhism was founded by its current president Allen Wong in Spring 2008, but due to systematic errors, did not start its activities until Fall 2009. It is presently the only campus club affiliated with Soka Gakkai International, a lay Buddhism Buddhist organization that promotes education and embracing cultural diversity in order to secure world peace and happiness of all people.


The club meets every Wednesday at 7pm in Olson 101 to explore and discuss concepts of Nichiren Buddhism. The meetings are a time of friendly and casual discussion between believers and skeptics, nonbelievers, or those who are simply curious about the practice.

Examples of topics studied so far include:
  Karma
  The founding and founder of Nichiren Buddhism, Nichiren Daishonin
  Oneness of the self and its environment
and
  Dependent Origination (or Interconnectedness)

Gosho studies are another recentlyimplemented activity where the members study the written letters of Nichiren Daishonin. This study series is led by Users/AlexNelson Alex Nelson in the campus quad (in the Memorial Union MU if it rains) every Tuesday and Thursday at noon and is open to all wishing to attend.

For more information, please email our club president at allwong@ucdavis.edu!
