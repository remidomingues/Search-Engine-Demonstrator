  Did you ever notice that little red circle sticker that you can put on your drivers license that says Donor?
  Do you know someone who has had a lifesaving organ transplant surgery?
  Do you know someone who is on a waiting list to receive an organ?
  Do you care?

College students, especially UC Davis students, can get involved in this important cause!

CLUB: Students for Organ Donation

A new Student Organizations club, founded by Tamara Taber and Kenneth Feng, has come to the UC  Davis campus and they are looking for new members. Because it is a new  organization, there are also many leadership positions available such as  executive directors for operations, development, finance, marketing, public  relations, community relations, and also web designer and secretary.

Hundreds of students on college campuses across the country have taken  action to make a difference in the lives of the thousands of Americans in  need of an organ transplant by establishing chapters of Students for Organ  Donation.  The national office provides  chapters with resources, direction, ideas, and a national network of  contacts with the goal of registering as many individuals as possible for  organ and tissue donation.  When all is said and done, not only will you  have increased public awareness for the need for organ donors, you will  have measurable results to validate your efforts.

With an everincreasing number of Americans in need of an organ transplant,  the national organ shortage is a growing crisis. Every single person who registers as a donor has the potential to save up  to 8 lives, and improve up to 50.  Unfortunately, studies show that there  is a tremendous gap between the number of Americans that support donation  and the number that actually donate.  Recruiting new donors on college  campuses will increase the pool of potential donors, and make an invaluable  difference in the lives of those in need of organ transplants.

If you are interested in becoming a member or an officer of Students for  Organ Donation, please contact:

Make a difference.  All are welcome!
