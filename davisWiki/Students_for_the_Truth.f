Students for the Truth is a Christian fellowship in Davis that consists of mainly students from UC Davis. They are affiliated with the church in Davis and hold weekly meetings and special activities throughout the school year. Their schedule consists of regular Bible studies on campus on certain weekdays, as well as a dinner/fellowship meeting on Friday nights. During such meetings, they engage in singing, reading the Word, and enjoying the Lord. Other notable activities that club members engage in include yearly conference fellowships that are held up in the mountains of Northern California, as well as blending trips to other cities that also have a college campus with a club similar to SfoT.

The church that SfoT is affiliated with consists of Christians that live in Davis, and they range from young people in grade school to adults. In that sense, SfoT is simply a representative club of the collegeaged saints of the church. The church in Davis is actually part of a larger grouping of churches that exist in many cities across the country and even the world, and they all simply take the name of the city that they are in, so the nomenclature would be the church in (city name). This larger grouping of churches is called the Lords Recovery.

SfoT currently has about 30 to 40 college students that meet regularly, mostly consisting of undergraduates and UCD alumni. Most of the members are Christians who grew up in the Lords Recovery and had already come in contact with SfoT and the church in Davis before their matriculation at UC Davis.
