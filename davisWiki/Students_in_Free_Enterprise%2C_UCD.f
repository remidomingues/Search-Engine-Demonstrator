Students in Free Enterprise. We are the go to student organizations student organization on campus. Our team is project oriented and our unique membership structure gives us the potential to grow our organization exponentially. All of our projects are constructed with the economic, social, and environmental impact in mind. We believe that our model allows for UC Davis students to ultimately have a more optimal positive impact on the local community. By being project oriented and managing projects virtually, we are able to leverage our resources to the fullest. Our UC Davis SIFE team is part of a 48,000 student network–the largest collegiate business club in the world.  We are one of 1500 teams that represent SIFE headquarters. For more information about SIFE headquarters visit SIFE.org .

This year we have focused our efforts on three areas:

1) Teaching financial literacy to youth,
2) Contribution towards the development of our community,
3) Creating a strong business network on campus through events and activities.
