Address(Studio Hair & Nail Salon, 38.552705, 121.713958) is a fullservice salon offering haircuts, manicures & pedicures, waxing, and facials.  Unlike other salons that do nails, the air inside Studio Hair and Nail Salon doesnt have a strong chemical smell. The stylists are friendly and lowkey. They play quiet and relaxing spa music in the background. Great atmosphere considering its located in a stripmall. A manicure/spa pedicure will run $35 (spa pedicure $22, manicure $15), while you can get a Brazilian wax for $35. Although the window says that haircuts are $11 and up, it has been the experience of multiple wiki users that they are more realistically in the $30$35 range.

If you are coming from downtown Davis, take Fifth Street past Pole Line Rd., beyond the traffic circle and past the Davis police department; the salon is inside the Fifth Street Plaza stripmall on the right hand side.

20051219 13:07:13 nbsp I went in on a Monday afternoon, with no appointment, to get my eyebrows done.  They did a fantastic job.  It was $10.  Previously I had gone to Pure Beauty in South Davis for this.  They charge $15, and did an inferior job.  Im definitely going back to Studio.  Users/SamanthaGrant

20051219 13:46:22 nbsp I LOVE this place! They always do a good job. I got a facial there for $35. Haircuts there are reasonable and have been consistently good. Users/MyaBrn

20060402 10:16:24 nbsp This place is great!  It is run by two sisters, Tiana and Devon, who are both very friendly and good at what they do.  I never want to go anywhere else to get my nails done!   Users/CatLa

20060512 08:19:40 nbsp I went a couple weeks ago to get a totally new hair style.  It had been really long and I decided to chop it all off. SO obviously I was nervious (I had never been there).  They really came through for me.  Very nice women, good listeners, with great hair cutting skills.  It looks awesome this is the best hair cut I have ever had!!!! And after an hour of shampoo cut and styl she only charged me $25 (dont worry I gave her a big tip).  I HIGHLY recommend this place!!! Users/SonyaChow

20060517 17:01:53 nbsp ok in addition to my glowing review I have to say... after getting my new do I brought my boyfriend in and they did a horrendous job.... it was lopsided there were holes... and they left him COVERED in little hairs.  After he showered it looked so bad he had to go someplace else and get his head totally shaved. This place is  for LADIES ONLY!!! Users/SonyaChow

20060518 13:00:44 nbsp SonyaChow, sorry to hear about your bf unpleasant experience, but I definitely need to add my very positive experience to this place .   My boyfriend came to this Studio Salon for a haircut all the times.  He has changed his style so many times.   He’s happy with the service and haircut .  In addition, we have refered a lot of our friends  to this place.  All of them are also satisfied.    Users/RachelAdams

20060604 23:17:16 nbsp I had a pretty disappointing experience for a leg waxing job: the room I was in was smelling like feet (and it was in late February, not a problem of heat) and there were tons of hair on the floor...nothing clean about that!  The waxing itself was done pretty poorly and it looked like she wasnt very experienced and not willing to change the tissue very often.  To finish my bad impression, it was totally overpriced!  $25 for halflegs, thats way too much...sorry but no thanks Users/SandrineJournet

20060606 08:34:06 nbsp Thanks to Studio Salon for making my hair looking great.  The reason I knew this place is because my friends went here. After I got a highlight and hair cut a few days ago.  I got a lot of nice compliments from people and family members such as color and shiny hair.   Just want to say “thankyou” .  I would recommend this place Users/ConnieTorres

20060616 06:42:20 nbsp I waxed at this place twice a month.  Let me tell you what I have gone to many places in Davis.  There were no places in Davis that cleanest like this place and has a great environment.  The services are very professional and they’ve done a superior jobs.   Simply put, I found a right place in Davis!!!  Well worth every penny Users/CristineHenry

20060725 13:05:39 nbsp This place is great.  I went in with my boyfriend and we both got haircuts and pedicures and the total price was $80.  Incredible.  I have very thick, difficult hair and the woman did a phenominal job cutting it.  One of the best cuts of my life.  My boyfriend was happy with his cut as well.  Also, the service was great and the employees were very friendly.   Dont let the strip mall fool you.  We will definitely go back.  Users/BethanyHelmboldt

20060918 23:13:31 nbsp Really nice owners, very friendly and nice. Didnt do my hair exactly as I planned but that happens. It was reasonable and she was nice.  Users/ChristyMarsden

20061114 12:02:17 nbsp These ladies are amazing.  They do wonderful color, and I love my cut.  Its the second best salon Ive ever been to...and the first best charged me $120 dollars for color/cut... Users/EmsChan

20070318 11:11:51 nbsp I went in for a leg wax on a Saturday afternoon. They were pretty busy and asked me to come back in an hour, so Id reccommend making an appt. if youre going on a weekend. They did a great job, and I will definitely be going back. Their price list said a half leg wax was  $35 but I was only charged $25. My friend went in with me and got a haircut it looks great was only $25.   Users/MandiPeterson

20071003 16:10:31 nbsp Devon highlighted and cut my hair and did a great job! highly recommended and very affordable :) Users/heatherpalko

20071203 22:05:15 nbsp Best place to get your eyebrows done. I have also gotten a cut and facial and was very pleased with those as well. Devon really takes her time with the haircuts to get them perfect.  Users/RDN

20071219 12:00:31 nbsp I dont normally go into nail salons to get haircuts, but this is a good place for guys to get a haircut. Friendly and consistent. Users/VinhBoy

20080317 16:19:34 nbsp Man did I mess up. I read all these good reviews about the good brows they do and so I decided to give it a try... went there and I went from having thick nicely shaped brows, to having 1 fish hook and 1 sperm looking brow that are very thin! She said that she needed to take a little bit off, and I was ok with that  a little bit. But it wasnt only a little. :( Its hair and theyll grow back  hopefully.  Users/Rachelottlinger

20080422 17:40:16 nbsp This place is a hidden gem!  Dont let the subpar location and the nofrills decoration of the salon fool you.  I had a haircut with Devon. Let me tell you, Ive never had anyone been soooo meticulous on my hair, EVER!!!  And I usually go to decent salons my whole life! She washed my hair twice, then conditioned it.  Really listened to what I wanted, cut it very meticulously while my hair was wet, dried my hair, straightened my already pretty straight hair, then carefully layered my hair once it was dried.  She really took her time, probably because I went in at 3:30pm on a Tuesday and that there were only two customers there too. She looked and measured, and layered my hair carefully and everything was detailed.  And I LOVE the finished hair.  Ive got long hair (mid back length) and she styled and trimmed the entire head, took her around just under an hour for everything, and she charged me $35!  I gave her a big tip though. Users/AmyNU

20080506 18:11:38 nbsp The people were nice but I wasnt happy with their services. I had a Brazilian wax (which I have been doing for at least 3 years now) and had a skin irritation. She missed some spots. Also its actually $45 for your first brazilian wax and if you return for another they drop the price to 35. I also had my hair done where she needed to bleach out my roots and she couldnt get the colors to match. (Which I have also had done many times before without a problem.) I didnt have my hair cut so I cant make a comment on that.  Users/dds1372

20080514 11:15:33 nbsp I usually have good experiences here, but ever since Yvonne (the youngest sister) started doing waxing, I think Im going to start avoiding this place.  I went once and got my eyebrows done from her and ended up having a scab under my eyebrow where she ripped the top layer of my skin off.  I thought that was just a bad experience and so went back to get a bikini wax, and now I have a huge blood bruise on my left inside leg and the wax is lop sided and she missed crucial hairs on the back of my inner legs where hair is definitely noticeable wearing a swimsuit.  Sucky. Users/NatFin

20080524 19:28:09 nbsp I decided to try the place because all of the good reviews but overall I wasnt that impressed. The haircut is better than supercuts but I was charged the price for a wash, cut, and blowdry when all she did was spray my hair wet. And the women hardly spoke to me or the rest of the customers but just to each other and not in English which is a little rude. I give the cut 8/10 and the experience a 6.5/10. Users/littlelemur

20080604 18:53:27 nbsp I had been to this place before for a pedicure and liked it, so I thought Id try it out for a bikini wax.  Do not go here for a bikini wax! They used nonwater soluble wax (which she promised me would wash off with cold water.  not!) and missed hair.  I got home and had to google how to get the wax off because I was sticky everywhere and it wouldnt come off in the shower. I then spent the next 20 minutes rubbing vegetable oil into my area.  Fun. I also have a bunch of blood bruises on my legs from her pulling over and over again, bit by bit, instead of getting clean rips. I have gotten many a bikini wax and this was subpar for sure.  I will not be going there again.     Users/schwedle

20080609 07:34:17 nbsp To schwedle and NatFin, you guys are so dumb and such a stupidity. if They used nonwater soluble wax (which she promised me would wash off with cold water. not!) and missed hair, then why wouldnt you come back there and have they remove the wax or redo the place that they missed your dirty hair. Another thing, you are such SO STUPID that you did not know wax sticking on your dirty private area before leaving the salon until you came home.

Did those salon technicians beat you up inside there??? why do you have a blood bruises?? none of things you said making sense to me.

you guys are such a liar.

I have been waxing at this salon more than a year now.  They did a perfect job on me. They used the most expensive wax because I also have been to other places in town, I know what kind of wax theyre using.  Users/andra

20080613 12:06:26 nbsp Youre not fooling anyone Yvonne. Do yourself a favor and learn English. Users/JeffKreis

20080702 12:39:10 nbsp Love this place!  All three sisters are great at what they do and are really genuinely nice.  I usually come here to get my eyebrows waxed, haircuts, and mani/pedicures.  If you want a great and detailed haircut, the middle sister (I forget her name) is the one to go to!  Reasonable pricing and clean place. Users/davisgirl10

20080830 17:31:51 nbsp I went to get my eyebrows waxed after making a last minute appointment. I was serviced very quickly and they did a fantastic job! Im definitely coming back here for eyebrows. Users/beluga

20081119 09:28:37 nbsp I have been coming here for over a year for bikini wax and occasional eyebrows and haircuts. Tiana is awesome. She is both professional and friendly. They are inexpensive, do a great job, and are willing to accommodate my sameday appointment requests and walkins (I rarely have my act together to schedule these things very far out in advance). The wax is high quality, and they will spend as much time as you request getting the job right.  Users/bustercat

20090225 01:21:19 nbsp I went there for the first time two weeks ago to get my eyebrows waxed. I had looked around at other places in Davis and this place was by one of the cheapest,HOWEVER you really do get what you pay for. Whom ever it was that waxed my eyebrows was very nice, but she waxed off the top corner of my eyebrow and made it look way thinner than the other. I tried to tell her and she tried to convince me that I didnt have hair there to begin with, which is ridiculous because before I went to her I had been growing them in so they could be reshaped for 3 weeks. Not only was the right eyebrow missing an end but the left eyebrow was wobbly looking. What a waste. Users/Malee

20090418 12:32:24 nbsp I love this place.  I have been coming here for years.  I have never had a botched eyebrow wax, and when I am feeling spendy and splurge on a manipedi it is always just what the doctor ordered.  I havent been to another salon in town where I havent left thinking that I would have gotten better quality or value from Studio.  I have had some really bad eyebrow jobs at other places in town and I wont do it again! Users/MargotParfitt

20090707 10:21:33 nbsp I went there to just get a trim. I told the lady half an inch and she did a good job, but I was very suprized when she told me that it cost 30 bucks! I know that most other places charge that much  but when you post on your window haircuts starting at $11 and you charge 30 for a trim (that I could probably do myself) what made it cost three times the base price?? Very misleading... Users/rnavarro1988

20090925 17:53:40 nbsp My haircuts from here always look great!  The younger sister is a bit scissorhappy but they always take the time to get it just right.  Ive gotten a lot of compliments after getting a cut here.  Theyre also really flexible about appointments and are open on Saturdays, which is a big plus. Users/UMDGrad

20091112 00:19:06 nbsp IF YOURE GOING TO THIS PLACE READ THIS FIRST!!!

Its a little pricey. There are two ladies who cut hair there. If youre going to go there always ask for the younger prettier looking one. The older one is RUDE!! Last time she cut my friends hair, she was so rude that well never go back there again. There were other customers so the lady was trying to hurry up with my friends hair. My friend was a little indecisive about how she wanted her hair. But in the end she did tell the lady that she wanted it thinner and the lady just said, Well you dont know what you want. So, just go home and play with it. And the lady just took off that thing that they cover you with to keep hair from getting on your clothes. Yeah, she just took it off and walked away from my friend.

And the first time I had my hair cut by that rude lady was the last. I had a bad hair cut from somewhere else, so I went here to get it fixed because my housemate recommended the place. The rude lady asked, Did you cut this yourself?! and just laughed at me. Thats just rude!! Then she starts talking to the other hair stylist in their own language. Hmmmm Im not stupid. You just got done laughing about me and then launch into a conversation in another language. That means you dont want me to know what youre saying right?

ITS JUST RUDE. THEY NEED TO STOP TALKING IN THEIR OWN LANGUAGE. I mean Im Asian too but when I go there I dont talk to my friends in our language. Its rude. And the way they behave you know theyre talking about you.   Users/liaface

20100327 12:49:39 nbsp I have been here a few times for a Brazilian and mani/pedi and Ive never been disappointed.

To liafaceplease stop assuming that they are talking about you. Ive been to so many Vietnamese nail salons and I never tell them I can understand what they are saying and not ONCE have they ever been talking about me or other customers, and this includes Studio. The ladies here were super nice to me and my friend. Just because you dont know what they are saying does not mean they are talking about you.  Users/masterofmasters

20100506 12:56:00 nbsp I absolutely HATE this place. The older lady straight up lied to me in my face. She originally said $1520, but when i got up to pay she said, oh i trimmed the ends of your hair, but since its long she had to charge me $10. like...what the hell is that?! she barely touched my heads, all i wanted was bangs and i was charged over $30!

I honestly feel like they overcharge you if youre not Vietnamese. and not to mention, theyre so rude. SPEAK ENGLISH! YOURE IN THE US. dont be fooled just because the place looks clean and pretty, its NOT WORTH IT.  Users/emme

20100506 12:57:28 nbsp  masterofmasters

all my best friends are vietnamese. and they ALL own a nail salon...or some salon. and trust me..they DO TALK ABOUT YOU! they just play it off as if theyre not Users/emme

20100511 17:08:02 nbsp I visited today to have a muchneeded haircut and decided to splurge on a pedicure while I was there.

I walked in after reading the wiki comments. One of the ladies was just finishing a manicure and took me right away. I described to her what I wanted and she discussed the pros and cons of the style and made suggestions that would make the hairstyle more manageable. Her suggestions were well reasoned, so I told her to go ahead with them and I must say that I am quite pleased (if I change my mind tomorrow when I try to style it myself, Ill let you know!).

The pedicure was great the water was the perfect temperature which surprised me. I almost always have to ask to have cold water added to the bath or else my toes scald off! I really enjoyed the massage chair, too. On top of it, Ive never seen anyone be so meticulous about painting toenails.

I was a little bit surprised when I went to pay. I expected to pay the $22 for the pedicure (since I asked about the price when I was getting my hair cut), but I was a little startled by the $35 price tag on the haircut. I had expected to pay around $25 for the cut judging by the Haircuts, $11 and up advertisement painted on the window. However, I do really like the cut and didnt have a problem paying it, since I know so many other places charge upwards of $60.

Overall it was a good first experience. Now that I have a more realistic idea of the price of getting my hair cut there, I wont be shocked when I return :) Users/StephanieStudebaker

20100802 11:27:03 nbsp I absolutely love this place.  I have been going there for quite some time.  They are so sweet and helpful.  I had a couple of surgeries last year that required parts of my head be shaved and for me to have stitches and staples at times... I wasnt allowed to get the incisions wet so I would go in to Studio and they would wash my hair for me.  They only charged a couple of dollars and then they would help me figure out a new flattering haircut to hide the missing hair.  I also get regular full sets and pedicures from them along with regular eyebrow waxes  I am always getting compliments on the shapes of my eyebrows and its certainly not natural.  Anyway I tend to forget the name of their salon for how often I go so Im always googling them and reading the daviswiki page  today seemed like the day to write a comment.  I highly recommend them!! Users/meaghan

20100808 11:00:44 nbsp I have to say, I had a really great experience here and I HATE getting my nails done.

I had pink & whites put on for a wedding by another salon and they were awful.  My fingers were KILLING me for two weeks.  I went in to this place with major skepticism and, admittedly, a bad attitude as my last experience elsewhere was so bad.  I told the lady (I forget her name!) that my fingers hurt and I just wanted the nails off.  Instead of popping and cutting them away, she soaked them for like an hour (since my fingers were so sensitive) and was really, really patient with me.  She pointed out the things the other salon had done wrong and instead of walking away with nasty, skinthin nails (which is what I thought would happen), they looked fantastic and strong.

She said shes been in the business for 15(?) years and I believe it.  She knew what she was doing and Id definitely recommend this place to anyone.  If I ever have to go back for nail services, I will definitely head here.   Users/marissa2112

20110214 21:02:15 nbsp Came here one afternoon to get my bangs trimmed. The lady initially told me the price was going to be $25. I thought it was a bit overprice considering it was just BANGS, but what the heck, Im already here. She said my ends looks a bit uneven so she cut it, I was like okay go ahead. Afterward she charged me $30 for the whole thing (session was only 15 minutes). My hair did not looked like it was ANY different at all. Also, did I mention she was laughing at me in another language with the other lady while at it (and yes, I KNOW they were talking about me since the other lady was glancing at me as well). I dont know whats with all these other good reviews but that was my experience. They were totally unprofessional and very misleading with their $11.99 & up price. Has anyone ever even gotten a haircut for under $20 here? If my bangs were $30, I am seriously having doubts about their supposed starting price. Users/NoelleSanders

20110219 20:14:45 nbsp I highly recommend getting your eyebrows waxed here.  No matter who I get them done with, the results are always excellent. Users/ChocolateFrogs

20111117 23:30:28 nbsp I love going here. I have been here many times and always have a great experience, no matter who I get. It is very affordable. The women who own the place are fantastic and super friendly. I get my hair colored here, my nails done, and my eyebrows waxed and all turn out great! I would definitely recommend this place!! Users/KMcGuire

20130829 20:03:12 nbsp This was my first visit to this salon. Devon gave me a pedicure. She speaks good English and is very nice, but I was disappointed with the pedicure. Devon spent far less time than my regular technician (who was on vacation) and wasnt very thorough. There was a  small callus on my big toe that techs usually rub away with a pumice stone. Devon said that she doesnt scrub or rub out dead skin or calluses. Id rather go elsewhere and pay a little more. Users/nowhereman
