This page is an evaluation of various places to study in Davis.  Some are places of business, and others are just good spots to study uninterrupted.  See also WiFi Hot Spots, Night Time (list of openlate places), Cafes, and Restaurants.  UC Davis Student Affairs has a list of extended study hours for finals: http://sa.ucdavis.edu/finals_study_hours.cfm

Study hints from Psychology:
Students who did best on tests were those who got sleep between the time of studying and the test. Students who stayed up all night and got no sleep did worse on tests than students who got sleep. The amount of study time was the same.

The reason for this is that sleep is necessary for memories to solidify. If you do not get sleep the memories do not stick. You can stay up and study but you will completely forget most of the information by test time. Those who got sleep recalled more information and were able to think more clearly during the test.

Studying for a short period of time everyday is better than waiting until the night before and trying to learn everything all at once. Cramming is an inefficient and mostly ineffective method of learning. Spacing out studying and learning a little each day will reduce stress, increase recall, and improve test scores.

 Outdoors 


  Arboretum Terrace  Probably one of the nicest outside places to study downtown. This is not the real Arboretum, its located on the side of what used to be Borders.
  Arboretum  The real thing.
  ARC  Outdoor tables in front of the Cafe are seldom used, and when there are not events going on in the inside courtyard, it is surprisingly quiet. All locations have MOObilenet.
  Amtrak Station  The train station has lots of very pleasant and comfortable benches. It is almost always empty so the only disturbance will come from the occasional extremely loud train passing by.
  Shields Library  The inner courtyard is a great study area.


 Indoors 
  Mondavi Centers Quarterly Study Session  Held in the Yocha Dehe Lobby of the Mondavi Center, free coffee, plenty of outlets, tables, and classical music are provided once a quarter during finals week. Like Aggie Arts on Facebook for quarterly dates!
  Carlson Health Sciences Library http://daviswiki.org/Health_Sciences_Library  Over by the Veterinary School and the Aggie Stadium, this library always has tables, study booths, and even personal or group rooms you can check out for hours at a time available.  Quiet and nice, find a seat by a power plug though they can sometimes be hard to find.  Wireless for UCD students with password and computers available for guest use.
  The Laundry Lounge  Here you have a couch and a few chairs. There are tables and chairs outside and they have FREE WiFi. Sit and study in a clean quiet environment, while you get your laundry done. Or have them do it for you.
  ARC  The Cyberlounge and Student Lounge are popular study spots with MOObileNet and campus DHCP ethernet ports.
  SLB  second and third floor indoor study lounges have lots of windows. There are also several small meeting rooms around the building that are often unlocked and not in use.
  Kemper Hall  The perfect place to go to get some work done if you are an Engineering or Computer Science major. Nice lounge area with comfortable chairs and some tables, as well a basement full of computers in the CSIF, which are accessible only to those who have taken certain classes in the department.
  Dorms LRC  even though you are supposed to have an access card, you can wait for someone to come out to get it! If you bring your laptop and an ethernet cable along, youll have internet too!
  Shields Library  It can be loud during the day, but at night its usually nice and quiet.  Also on the plus side is the wireless internet available there, so you can surf the web with your laptop when taking breaks during long study sessions.  Academic masochists may also enjoy using one of Shields Study Cages study cages.
  24 Hour Reading Room   This place is technically part of Shields Library, but its open 24 hours.  Its usually ultra quiet and not super conducive to group study, though it does include two rooms set aside for group work.  The room is only accessible to students and requires a reg card to get in.  All the tables include tabletop outlets for whatever you need to plug in (very nice).  Best part is that its always open.
  Griffin Lounge  Busy, but quiet.
  Davis Public Library  They have study rooms for 2 people or large groups(4+). Otherwise, plenty of tables and chairs for your use, but they arent open very late on weekends.
  Your Desks  Study at home where you have the luxuries of allnight alcohol, TV, Internet Access internet, food, and endless procrastination.
  Some apartments have computer centers or study areas, having created areas in their complex that are similar to common areas of dorms.
  Fahads Apartment: 1100 Olive Drive, Apt 265!

 Cafes 
Cafes Coffee shops tend to be more tolerant of studiers than restaurants.  The basic rule of thumb is to buy something once in a while, so you dont actually cost them customers while you merely hog space.

 The Good 
  Common Grounds  Very tolerant of studiers  the owner and staff are quite friendly to regulars, including those who come to study (one customer does regular chess tutoring to kids here).
  Delta of Venus  Though theres always the danger of spotting a familiar face around Delta, afternoons are often pretty sparse and quiet, especially after the brunch rush on the weekends. While not in possession of many electrical outlets, the whole atmosphere is more open and more conducive to studying if you prefer studying in less cramped conditions.
  Mishkas  They are the best of both worlds. They are tolerant and helpful to studiers, while at the same time freeing up some tables for casual coffee drinkers.  See Mishkas entry for a picture of their famous The Rule.
  Starbucks ARC Starbucks  This place is made for studying. Its huge and has tons of seating and tables. Its also clean and new.
  Cloud Forest Cafe  This place has a decent amount of room inside and on the patio for studying; it used to be a game room, after all! Also, the food they have  in addition to their awesome coffee  should keep your spirit fueled while you study. Plus, the staff is incredibly friendly.

 Restaurants 
While studying in a restaurants restaurant may not always be a good thing to do, some do promote studyfriendly atmosphere.

 The Good 
  Orange Hut  CLOSED
   One time I forgot when they opened and got there an hour early.  The guy let me in anyway and cleared a table for me so I could study there.  These guys are truly AWESOME.  Users/MarieHuynh
  Crepeville  Decent, although dont abuse this.  Word is that the management is increasingly frustrated with studiers who do nothing but order coffee and get free refills during peak times.  If we want to preserve this place as a place to study, actually having dinner would be a good idea.  And they have salads so huge, it takes about 2 hours to eat, anyway.
  Woodstocks Pizza  Very loud, but very tolerant and friendly


 The Bad 
  IHOP  Not recommended.  Its much easier to get away with merely reading, than doing homework.  After about 5 coffee refills they get a little annoyed.
     Users/Frankenbunny: I cant recall how many times Ive been blown off just because I had my books out.  Once, I couldnt even get a soda refill during my meal.

 Study Parties 
 Getting together with a group of kids to just straight up study can totally increase your motivation. Study parties can be an amazing venue for learning about people NOT JUST ABOUT WHAT YOURE STUDYING.  Anyone think of Breakfast Club when they read that?

 Paid Space 

  The Work Shop  Downtown location: upstairs at 213 E Street. Quiet, wifi, open floor plan, desks and shared tables available. Daily, weekly, monthly, night owl and weekender options. Tryitout for 1/2day for $5.



20060303 06:27:58 nbsp The ARC is an excellent place to study on the weekends when the library is too far or too boring. Simply enter and sit in the couches at the front of the complex. Its extremely relaxing when there are relatively few people.

20060802 16:40:17 nbsp I actually go to Borders every week to study, and I have never been kicked out; Ive stayed there for about 34 hours maximum, and they are really nice about it. I think it was the workers at the time who were idiots (for all those with previous experience). And to the guy who got mad about the chess people: the lady shouldnt have kicked you out, especially if there were empty seats, but dont hate on chess players! Let alone the coaches probably paid borders. That lady was stupid, I hope she isnt there anymore.  Users/MelanieDelacruz

20070901 15:37:06 nbsp Delta of Venus is the place to study. No doubt. Users/JoshuaLee

20071230 22:31:14 nbsp Is Borders not friendly to studiers?  Really?  When I was studying for the LSAT (granted, this was a while back), I would show up at Borders in the morning and order a triple white mocha and study there until the evening.  This was my daily routine for three solid weeks.  I would only leave for lunch and none of the staff ever said anything to me.  And even now when I go get my coffee, I see people studying. Perhaps it is time to move Borders from the Ugly list? Users/CurlyGirl26

20080316 02:18:00 nbsp One thing I learned from my many Psychology classes that really helped me out is that people do better on tests if they have a period of sleep between studying and the test. Sleep helps to solidify memories and make them permanent. It also makes you more rested to take the test. Those who pulled an allnighter, did worse on tests because they did not have the period of sleep in between. You need to have a minimum amount of sleep to solidify those memories. Sleep is a wise investment of your time. Users/Jedron

20080807 21:33:20 nbsp I like to sit in on other classes in large lecture halls while I do work or study, that way if I get distracted, Im still learning something! Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20091208 23:13:07 nbsp To add to the bit about Crepeville, Ive gotten some pretty gross coffee after asking for a refill while Im studying, even after Ive ordered food. That was enough to get me out. Users/Patrick.M

20130214 22:00:48 nbsp Are there any good place for group study, particularly with a whiteboard/chalkboard? I feel like Davis is lacking and whenever I try to study in a classroom, someone else comes in to use the class. Users/tiffng
