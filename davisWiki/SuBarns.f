Describe Users/SuBarns here.
Welcome to the Wiki.  I reverted your changes to the Chateau Apartments page, then readded the new phone number you used.  Please take a moment to look over the Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner business representative page.  Its bad form to delete other users commentsto say nothing of leaving a positive comment thats clearly intended to mislead readers into thinking youre just a visitor, rather than a representative of the apartment.  That business rep page has some useful info on how to constructively respond to negative comments and deal with other problems that may arise on the wiki.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask.  Users/TomGarberson
