SubCity was a purveyor of sandwiches (possibly even submarine sandwiches) located in the Silo. It was replaced by Silo Sandwiches.



I wonder how one would define Submarine Sandwiches. I purchased one there last week, only to suprisingly find that it looked just like a regular sandwich. It was fairly good, though. I shall definitely go back.  Users/JosephBleckman

   Submarine sandwich is a sandwich in the style of those served to the naval construction yard workers on the East coast during WWII.  Like many other meal in a loaf of bread style sandwiches that sprung up at about the same time (for instance, the Po Boy to striking workers in New Orleans), they are designed to be easy to carry, keep for a morning and provide a full lunch when paired with just a beverage.

20090723 05:12:55 nbsp I bought a sandwich here and will not return! I ordered a turkey with pesto for my boyfriend. I asked the lady working there what kind of pesto it was. My boyfriend cannot stand sun dried tomato pesto but loves the green pesto. She told me it was green. But of course they work behind a counter where you cant see what they are making and when my boyfriend unwrapped the sandwich it had RED pesto on it! He told me how horrible it tasted and how angry he was with that woman who lied to me. I was pissed! I wanted to buy a nice lunch, but instead she ruined his sandwich! She knew I had asked what kind of pesto it was, and yet, she still put on the wrong one! It wasnt just an honest mistake, or that I had just forgot to ask! Im so angry and will never return!
