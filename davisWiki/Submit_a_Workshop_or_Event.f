 >Workshop/Event Application< 
To submit a workshop or event to the Davis Peoples Free School, email the following information to mailto(davispeoplesfreeschool@riseup.net):

Name
Including your name would be a nice way to be able to identify who you are!

Public Contact
Where can people reach you? Use a phone number or email address that you feel comfortable giving out to strangers, as this will be the contact information we give out so students can reach you.

Date/Time
1) Either pick an arbitrary date that works for you, or
2) if youre only willing to do a workshop when you know enough people will show up, then include a list of possible dates and times that work for you & a minimum number of attending students to make it worth your while.
If you choose this method, a scheduling poll will be attached to the end of your event listing on our http://daviswiki.org/Davis_People%27s_Free_School/Calendar calendar. To see how many people have indicated availability for each date/time, click on the link next to your event called Click here to enroll! Once the minimum number is reached for a particular date, the scheduling poll will be removed and that date/time will be listed next to your class listing. Please check the listing every so often to check for the decided class date/time. Also, if your availability changes, please inform DPFS right away at mailto(davispeoplesfreeschool@riseup.net).

Venue/Location:
Offer up your living room, find a public space, get permission to a private facility, or ask us for help. If you need a specific type of location and donâ€™t have access to it, give us the description of the requirements and well see what we can do to make it happen. Keep in mind offcampus locations tend to have bigger turnouts.



 Requirements: 
 must be open to everyone regardless of age, gender, student/nonstudent status, ethnicity, religion, etc.
 purpose/style must be participatory and create a supportive environment for everyone to share and learn.
 teachers many not charge except for the exact cost of required materials (e.g. the raw metal for a metalsmithing class). In addition, the workshop must be open to everyone; to the best of the instructors ability (e.g. those that didnt bring or cant afford metal will be allowed to watch demonstrations at the metalsmithing class).
 Admission to the venue must be free.
 No hate speech.

Note: DPFS reserves the right to reject workshops for new reasons other than those listed above, especially in cases that the workshop does not adhere to our http://daviswiki.org/Davis_People%27s_Free_School/Mission_Statement Mission Statement. If you would like to discuss why your workshop was rejected (rejection is rare), please email us! Were nice people!

If your workshop for some reason does not meet our requirements, have it anyway!
Or, see if you can change it to meet our requirements and then resubmit your proposal!

 Does that make sense? 
Feel free to email in with questions. mailto(davispeoplesfreeschool@riseup.net)
