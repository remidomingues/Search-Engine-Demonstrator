This place sells and rents pro audio gear. Andy arguably has the biggest and best rental inventory in the region. He also does repairs and designs gear for companies youve probably heard of if you do sound reinforcement. If you find that you need a bunch of XLR5 connectors or something similarly obscure, its a good bet that he has it.
