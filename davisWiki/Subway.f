Subway is a large national chain of sandwiches sandwich shops.  The Restaurants restaurant has several local locations, and could be described as the McDonalds of sandwiches. Any of these Davis franchises offers pretty much the same as any other Subway. Many of their sandwiches are tasty and depending on the sandwich they vary on how filling they can be for a person. Get a free 6 sub (of equal or lesser value) when you buy any 6 sub and a medium drink using your free Super Saver Card. The $5 footlongs do not include the premium sandwiches, but do include meatball. The list of $5 footlong sandwiches varies with each store and often changes every month.

Subway also features other items such as salads, cookies, apple pieces, yogurt parfaits, and chips.

Subway is also open for breakfast with special breakfast sandwiches which are quite different than the regular subway sandwiches served the rest of the day.

Drinks include soda, 1% milk, apple juice, bottled water, ice tea, and Seattles Best Coffee.

All of Subways locations are franchised. This means that a local owner owns the local store and pays Subway to use the Subway name as well as a percentage of the profits. Each store is run by a local owner and therefore there may be variations in the service that you get from one store to the next.

20051106 18:03:13 nbsp The Subway at Mace and Chiles has a great deal too; after 3pm, you can get two footlong subs for about $7.50  buy one and keep the other in your fridge. Users/JaredTrace
  or just eat both...?
  Mmm, yes. A very good choice.  Users/NickSchmalenberger

20051216 10:20:06 nbsp I like the one at the UMall.  Always quick and do extra stuff if I ask them (like heating up my roast beef).  And its cheap also D Coupons everywhere in the mail Users/JoAnnaRich

20060706 23:03:54 nbsp Ive been to the Subway shop Downtown about four or five times, and every time the staff have been unfriendly and displayed poor customer service.  They dont seem to care if customers come back, so I never will.  Besides, Zias Delicatessen Zias, Togos Togos and the CoHo MU CoHo are far, far better choices. Users/DukeMcAdow
   I have just returned from the downtown Subway and the employee there was very courteous. He was not overjoyed to serve me but he was prompt in greeting me and was not unpleasant. He even asked if I had a stamp card so he could stamp it, I said I didnt and he gave me one without asking. Users/KellyM

20060911 08:02:42 nbsp the people at the U mall seemed to have a good time laughing at me when I ordered my tuna sandwich toasted.  I was annoyed to have a whole restaurant laughing and not tell me why. Users/RohiniJasavala

20061001 19:03:27 nbsp Yea, the staff at the Umaill stares at you with ...weird...glares... Users/JamesLi

20061019 14:35:07 nbsp At the downtown subway, they told me the 2 footlongs deal doesnt apply anymore to sandwiches with steak, which disappointed me greatly. I hope they change their sign soon. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20070126 13:59:01 nbsp the staff at the UMall are pretty mean. They do laugh at you and say stuff about u in another language while u right in front of them. I had a friend go in there with me who spoke a language similar to theirs and apparently they like spreading gossip...even the father who works there too. Overall they dont know how to follow directions and are not friendly at all. Last time i went there one of the girls i specifically told her not to put hot pepers on my sandwich and she tried to sneak them on because she talked crap about me last time i was there and remembered me. Be careful there and definately watch them closely when they make ur food. The girls working there are awful. I wont ever be a customer at that subway again...Its disgusting how they treat people, seriously.  Users/KimberlyMiller

20070126 18:23:44 nbsp I too feel uncomfortable in the UMall Subway. As such I now go to the one across HWY 113. TR

20070320 03:56:19 nbsp I was at the one downtown about a year ago and as I was leaving I saw one of the workers go straight from mopping the floor to making someones sandwich without washing his hands! Suffice to say I am not going to that particular Subway ever again. I have no major qualms with the other ones though. Users/SteveKent

20070528 17:19:18 nbsp I wish I could experience what many of the people on here have said about the UMall Subway.
It sounds really fake, to an extent. Users/JonathanMartinez

20070604 17:23:55 nbsp I DO NOT recommend going to the Subway in East Davis (by HWY 113)... the people who work there must be the actual owners or something because they will sooo skimp you on the sandwich...basically hand you a loaf of bread with a small piece of lettuce and some meat.  Worst sandwich I ever had there, and there deals SUCK.  Caution:  Theyll charge you more then other subways, I learned the hardway.  This place shouldnt even be a subway: THAT bad. Users/christyspencer

20070604 23:43:42 nbsp Highway 113 is nowhere near East Davis... Fake comments indeed. Users/NickSchmalenberger
    The one in West Davis is right next to it though.

20070618 03:01:46 nbsp UMall  very unprofessional. One guy cut his hand with the knife and kept slicing the sandwich. Needless to say I threw it out. Users/doug124

20070819 20:58:30 nbsp I have eaten at the Oak Tree and Chiles locations, and Im sorry to say that they are the worst Subways Ive ever been in. The workers seem extremely undertrained, and the sandwich quality is substandard. Heres a typical example of my experiences: they were displaying a list of specialty sandwiches on a display board. I ordered one of the sandwiches. The gentleman behind the counter then started asking me which items I wanted on the sandwich. I told him that I just wanted the ones that normally came on the sandwich, but that didnt seem to help him at all. I literally had to walk over to the display and read off the list of ingredients on the sandwich so that he would know what I wanted. I wont return to these locations. Users/MattCzarnowski

20070820 22:02:55 nbsp i perfer the u mall subway to the downtown subway.  Some people skimp on the ingedients, but if they do i just ask for extra lettuce, extra... They no longer skimp on me anymore, because they know ill just ask for more :).  It is really convenient for a post workout healthy meal since it is so close to the arc. Users/MattHh

20070909 23:13:58 nbsp Went to East Davis location on Friday.  Not too busy.  The veggie delite was okay.  They go light on the vinegar, so dont be shy and ask them to go heavy on it.  :) Users/Casey

20071216 22:55:43 nbsp The last couple of times that Ive had subway in central davis, Ive felt slightly nauseated afterwards. And, no, the people who work there arent particularly friendly.  Users/Kiran

20071217 00:36:36 nbsp I went to the Central Davis Subway around 9:50 at night and got two 12 inch subs to go, a chipotle cheese steak and a meatball, both on Italian parmesan bread. The steak one was better, which has usually been my experience with Subway. They could have been mad at me because they were about to close, but they were very nice, I had a good time. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20080323 18:31:44 nbsp I hate the UMall Subway. The people who work there are a bunch of arrogant douchebags who skimp on everything. They gave me very little meat and cheese and like a few shreds of lettuce. They didnt even ask if I wanted mustard or mayo. I had to ask for what I wanted, instead of being offered what I should expect. Wost customer service ever.  Users/EmilyTung

20080327 16:41:29 nbsp managers are rude and service is poor at the WEST davis location. the one next to 113. horrible customer service. Users/markphillips

20080402 18:14:13 nbsp I agree about one woman at the UMall Subway talking about customers (namely, me) in a different language to another employee.  The other employee didnt partake in the talk though.  Other than that, theyve been pretty decent with me.  When one talks about someone in another language, the someone is going to assume its not positive, especially if the body language suggests its not positive. Users/RonB

20080501 11:37:39 nbsp The subway by Valero off mace blvd is bad. Everytime I go they are either rude or mess up my order and I noticed I got charged more there than for the same sandwhich at a different subway in town (not including the atm fee) Users/Kry

20080613 20:51:50 nbsp I love them sandwiches!  Users/jrendler

20080819 11:46:21 nbsp The UMall Subway is easily the worst Subway I have ever been to in my life. The guys that work there are extremely rudeyou have one guy who looks like a juiced out bulldog, and another guy who looks like an name of his ethnicity version of Bela Lugosi from the old Dracula movies. These guys obviously do not enjoy where they work at. My girlfriend also got creeped out by some guy by the way he was talking to her/serving her. Needless to say, after feeling disappointed several times here, I am not returning my business any longer. Users/ArlenKwong
 I dont see how their looks establish their rudeness. Your examples do not support your argument.  Users/NickSchmalenberger

 Let me clarify why these guys suck. They just arent friendly and lack customer service skills. They always seem annoyed and they dont make the experience comfortable. Users/ArlenKwong

20080821 11:37:11 nbsp In regards to the UMall subway, i understand the other comments about the staff. However, if you get the right employee, the sub comes out fine.  Also if you are not satisfied with the amount of lettuce/tomato they put on the sandwich, use the words extra pickles or a little more after the put item in question on, and they are usually happy to do so.  Remember, people cant mind read how much lettuce you want on a sandwich.  Also I am from the east coast (where they do subs right), and always add double meat to my subway sub, because then it actually becomes a sub and not a sandwich.  I am also an avid TUNA fan, and it is to be know that the UMall subway makes the tuna CORRECT and NOT swimming in mayonnaise, the south davis tuna is drenched in mayo, and the Oaktree one is passable.   Users/donjumpsuit

20080921 03:21:39 nbsp THERES ONE PROBLEM.. IF YOU BUY THE $5 DOLLAR SUBS, THEY PUT LESS STUFF ON YOUR SUB AND TRY TO DO A HALFAS JOB. IF YOU BUY A PREMIUM SUB, THEY TAKE THEIR TIME MAKING YOUR SUB. Users/2point0student

20081009 17:50:56 nbsp The subway at the Nugget market is by far the best subway Ive been too, and throughout my 4+ years of college Ive been to every single subway in Davis more times than I care to admit.  They are always relatively pleasant, and dont grumble when you ask for extra produce Users/Strategiry

20081012 10:20:56 nbsp If youre ever hungry and want something cheap, $5 footlongs are the best! Users/feichuhuya

20081104 18:29:26 nbsp I just came from the SUBWAY in DOWNTOWN DAVIS and they have FLIES!! flying around like crazy on their veggies and the plexiglas window. That is sooooo UNSANITARY I threw away my sandwich due to a lack of appetite. Every time a fly lands on food, it vomits digestive enzymes so that it can slurp the food. It also carries germs from wherever theyve landed and onto your food. They have poor customer service as well, they dont listen to what I want on the sandwich. I am never ever going back again. You are really paying your $5 worth of a sandwich!!! ( Users/ucdavisjenn

20081118 23:16:19 nbsp at the umall, the guy who looks like a beaten gorilla kept staring at the other girl working as he cut the bread. great idea... Users/ketan

Agreed.  Hes a dick.  Looks as miserable as he feels working there.  You sure as hell know it from the way he acts too.


  ketan, u r killing me softly w/ that beaten gorilla comment....rotfl... Users/KimberlyMiller

20090204 15:35:49 nbsp The Subway in East Davis on Covell is the best Ive ever been to. The one downtown comes in second. But the one on Covell is awesome! They always have the bread cooked perfectly and the produce is always fresh. I went to a Subway in Sacramento and the bread was not fully cooked, and the vegetables were gross tasting and not fresh at all. We were there at 11am so they must have had it sitting out all night! Next day we had to rekindle our love for Subway, so we stuck with the Covell location. Thanks subway!  Users/Rachelottlinger

20090317 01:36:43 nbsp I frequent the UMall location, but I agree to an extent with some of the sentiments expressed by other people on this page.  They have a few employees that tend to give attitude, and are a little skimpy on ingredients.  I either misspoke, or was misheard by the man taking my order, and he for some reason thought I wanted two sandwiches.  I noticed this before he started on the second sandwich, telling him Im sorry, I only wanted one.  He responded You said two, to which I said Sorry, I meant one.  The employee continued to reiterate that I had said two.  Im not sure why it mattered so much that he was right, or not, I just wanted my damned sandwich.  This was not the first time where Id felt he was a little less than customer friendly...I dont expect the guy to make small talk, but I also dont want to be mad dogged when Im paying them to make me a freaking sandwich.  But yeah...I dont know if theres something else he can do, but I would not put him out in the front if I were the employers.  Definitely not the most savvy person in terms of interfacing with customers. Users/sososharp

20090329 05:23:53 nbsp If youre on or around campus, skip the UMall Subway. Their soda fountain is very mediocre, and the sandwich wasnt great either. Go to the downtown location insteadbeen there quite a few times and Ive never had a bad experience. Users/AlexChiang

20090416 14:34:09 nbsp After experiencing ridiculously poor customer service, I feel that I must comment on this page.  The employees that work @ the UMall Subway need to go to some customer service seminars.  Not only do they look like theyre pissed at you for your presence, but they speak to you like they dont give a $!t.  Here is a typical experience I have every time I go to Subway, including this afternoon. As I was looking at the new menu with increased prices, I was greeted with an annoyed and impatient mumble, What do you want?  There was no good afternoon, or how may I help you.  It was a mumbled, what do you want?, like he wanted to beat me.  There was no one behind me and it wasnt busy at all, yet the server impatiently repeated the question louder.  I dont know how the server doesnt realize that Im browsing the new menu with increased prices.  So I ordered, and as my sandwich was being passed along, I had to repeat several times what toppings I wanted.  Everything but pickles, I said.  I was met with a blank stare so I repeated loudly and clearly.  Another blank stare but the server went to work putting toppings onto my sandwich that I did not want and withholding those I did request.  I was made even more irritated, but by that time I just didnt give a damn anymore.  I was hungry and just wanted to get out of there and eat my sandwich. Finally, and unfortunately, I have to give them my money.  The employee mumbles very quickly something that sounds like meal or sandwich?  I remember the first time I went to the Subway@Umall it took me about 30 seconds to realize what the hell they were saying.  Because of my laziness to visit Subway in other parts of town, I resort to going to the one at Umall.  However, after todays experience, I will no longer be returning.  I have never in my life experienced such horrible customer service and after enduring it many times, today was was the last straw.  Having worked in several customer service oriented establishments, I know that at the end of the day employees can be tired and a little grouchy.  Its still no excuse to treat customers like $!t and still take their money. Users/BenLee

20090515 20:19:02 nbsp The one at U Mall has horrible customer service.  They just seem like they have a broom up their A$$ all the time.  Try not to give them the benefit of your business.  Go somewhere else. Users/julpham

20090531 21:28:09 nbsp The comments on this page about the UMall Subway scared me away, and I live a few blocks away from it. Instead, I biked 2 miles to the downtown Subway and my experience was perfectly acceptable. I ordered a chicken footlong and Im happy to say that no toppings were skimped on, it was pretty much exactly like my experiences at a much busier subway in a much bigger city. Users/KellyM

20090607 15:01:15 nbsp The employees at the UMall location really need to learn to listen. Pretty much every time I go, I see the same employees and I always have to repeat my order, even if I say I want two toppings. Also, today the avocado they put on my sandwich was clearly overripe; the flesh was completely brown. If I hadnt said anything, the employee just would have put it on my sandwich. The downtown locations employees are always friendly and courteous what a nice change.  Users/acparsons

20090608 02:54:46 nbsp Ive been to the downtown location a few times, theyre pretty friendly and they seem to have light mayo (something the central davis location DOESNT have). They also warm up the chicken in my sandwich correctly, as well.

The central davis location...wow, where do I begin? A lot of the negative comments above sum it up pretty well. Just to add onto it, though...theyre definitely lazy and rude. Lazy because they warm up the chicken breast improperly. The chicken breasts sit out with everything else semifrozen, and they just throw it on the bread when they toast it so when you eat your sandwich, its still a bit cold. Other subways ive gone to heat the chicken separately. Also, they dont have light mayo. And when the $5 footlong promotion was still new, they had a time period where they removed it (although the downtown location still honored it). Theyre rude because they laugh/make fun of their customers, but try to do it secretly...

I can go on forever about this place! In a nutshell, give your business to another subway because the one at Umall blows. Users/shopaholic

20090724 02:36:33 nbsp One of the main guys downtown is super nice and friendly.  The others are...not so much, haha.  But seriously, a delicious, healthy meal for $5 is a great deal! Users/sm0729

20090913 13:34:23 nbsp UMALL is TERRIBLE. CUSTOMER SERVICE is TERRIBLE. Employees need hearing aids to get orders and you need to either repeat your order fifty times or say it really loud like a staff seargeant when they are habituating toward you. As a psychology major, the UMall staff would greatly benefit from taking a few remedial perceptual psychology classes to learn to finer points of making sandwiches without hassle. The worst part about UMall is that when it is busy during lunchtime the employees decide to go on long smoke breaks. These guys are ridiculous! They still have the same employees and I am now a junior at Davis! One of them is a big mexican on steroids who impolitely grunts out his words and the other mexican is a small little beadyeyed guy who looks like he smokes too much dope before going to work. Either way UMALL SUCKS and they need to get their shit together if they want to stay in business. If it wasnt for the location next to the herd of asinine freshman, they woulda gona outta business a long time ago. AVOID UMALL AT ALL COSTS. They also skimp on meat and exhibit poor attitude. They are incapable of saying Thank you and have a nice day with a smile. Unless you are like a policeman or something its YOU WANT MEAL??? (kinda like me so horny) and then OK 5 DOLLAR. Note I am an English major and these guys are horrible at plurals. They also charge sporadic amounts  sometimes my meatball is 5 even and other times it is $5.55 because they had to use the power. UMALL IS HORRIBLE AVOID LIKE THE BLACK DEATH. RUDE, INCONSIDERATE, MONEYGRUBBERS WHO EXPLOIT FRESHMAN AT UCD!!! Users/Andy890

20090913 22:37:05 nbsp In contrast to Andy890s comment, I never found the UMall Subways employees to be overtly foul in any manner, although I have experienced inconsistencies in their pricing. (I am also now a junior at Davis, although I dont know how relevant that is.) Yes, service can be slow sometimes during lunch, some employees there have a better grasp of English than others, and you sometimes have to repeat your order because its loud inside but I never faced outright rudeness.

All I want is a sandwich. And I usually come out with a pretty good one for cheap here. Perhaps, and I am saying this sincerely, my standards are just not high enough. Users/kthrnngo

20091006 16:56:29 nbsp I frequent the Downtown location several times a week and the employees are great.  I have never had a complaint about them skimping on anything and if I ever want more of one thing or another, I never feel awkward about asking because of how the employees are.  Their new buffalo chicken is great (double meat, 6 inch on wheat, no cheese, and just a tiny bite of lite ranch  500600 calories with 52g of protein  perfect for me since I already have an extremely low fat diet otherwise) and I intend on ordering that often.  The only downside about his location is how cold it can get sometimes.  Seems like they have no control over the air conditioning. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20100210 16:30:06 nbsp SOMEONE SHOULD BURN DOWN THE SUBWAYS AT THE UMALL.  They have the worst customer service ever.  This one lady was giving me so much attitude, and she just threw my sandwich together.  When I got home, my sandwich fell apart.  A little kid could have made a better sandwich.  On top of that, she snatched my money from me.  It seems like they dont even want business.  If thats the case, I am never going back again.   Users/iRuletheWorld

20100210 17:44:34 nbsp The food at Subway is terrible.  Dont go there ever. Users/rfrazier

20100315 15:48:16 nbsp The Downtown Subway is the BEST. When you want more of something, they dont skimp. At other locations when I ask for more, for example, bell peppers, theyll like put two more pieces on. And then I ask for more, and i get 2 more pieces. So I explain that i love bell peppers, so go ahead and stack it on and i include hand motions... and they still dont get it! I LOVE DOWNTOWN! PLUS theres a stamp card woot! Users/ILikeToEat

20100316 20:10:56 nbsp The UMall Subway really is subpar. The pricing isnt really clear, and the $5 Footlong does not apply to the Premium Sandwiches, which are more or less everything that isnt ham, turkey, or vegetarian.  This directly contradicts a smaller sign they have describing the nutritional information.  I gave them a hard time about it, during which they tried to tell me that wasnt what the sign said (as if I cant read...).  At the end I told them they could keep the sandwich and make me a new one, or give me the $5 deal.  I left with my sandwich for $5. :) Users/MasonMurray

20100624 13:17:56 nbsp Im kind of a Subway nut.  I love veggies of all varieties, which means that Subway is head and shoulders above most other cheap sammich options, and they also have some really tasty sauces.  Sure, the breads, meats, and cheeses are nothing special, but theres also nothing wrong with them.  Im a huge fan of the Italian BMT, the Sweet Onion Chicken Teriyaki, and the Chicken Breast with chipotle sauce, mustard, and vinegar.  All of them, of course, heaped with every type of veggie on the list.

I like the folks at the West Davis location a lot.  Always friendly, and not at all stingy with the fixings.  The UMall location can get a little stingy and is rarely very friendly, so I tend to avoid it.  Subway is definitely my goto for quick, cheap sammiches. Users/TomGarberson

20100701 14:53:09 nbsp UMall Subway should be avoided at all cost. The customer service is essentially nonexistent. Upon entering you are greeted with depressed faces, disgruntled expressions, careless actions, and general rudeness. Want anything else? in a slightly shrill and nagging tone is no way to service your customers. Also, carelessly assembling a sandwich doesnt improve service either. I do not like someone absentmindedly tossing toppings or blindly cutting my bread. Go next door to Fluffy Donuts and order one of their sandwich deals  they are far cheaper, not at all different in taste, and the owners customer service is a galaxy apart from Subways discontented club of sandwich makers.

20101018 09:58:00 nbsp AVOID the Downtown location these guys recklessly charge extra for what I would consider to be normal toppings (olives and such). I ordered a $3 sandwich and two $5 footlongs, expecting my total to come to $13, yet it magically came to $18, apprently because of the extra olives and salami added to the sandwiches. But why would Subway charge a whole $5 extra? Because the receipt is not itemized, one cannot evaluate what was charged extra. Further, the cute Indian girls give the impression that they do not speak English terribly well so I didnt want to harrass them over it. Ive learned my lesson Im never returning to get charged so much extra. Users/OaxacaAbroad

20110622 00:10:16 nbsp I heard that the University Mall Subway was one of the most busiest Subways in whole nation. That being said, they make it quickly and charge you the real price.

20110919 02:27:37 nbsp Ive been to Downtown and University Mall locations.  First, Downtown  Ive only been to this one four or so times, because its out of the way.  The place is tiny, the people were mildly friendly, and they seemed more expensive.  The food was okay though.  The University Mall, Ive been to more times (probably 15 or so times), but that was back when there was more than just one $5 foot long.  For some reason, everyone working at this location has the personality of a cadaver... Even when I speak nicely and try to sound pleasant, the response is lacking, if existent at all.  Foot longs from here dont seem to satisfy me at all, and combined with the removal of the common $5 foot longs, Ive stopped going.  I dont want to eat a 1200 calorie sandwich and not feel satisfied. Users/KurtSassenrath

20120122 19:53:12 nbsp The employees at the UMall location are very rude and lazy. I was a frequent customer but I will not be returning after today.  Users/OliviaGlass

20120219 20:11:46 nbsp I usually go to the downtown location if I can: theyre more generous with toppings, have the $5footlong promotion more often, and even had a buyXget1freewithpurchaseofdrink card (now long gone). The University Mall location is a little stingier on the veggies (only so that your sandwich isnt bursting at the seams). I wouldnt say that the employees here are rude and lazy, but if you dress and act like a student, expect to be treated as one. Users/Roarasaurus

20120319 22:25:18 nbsp Just picked up a sandwich from here today. I work in the food service industry so I make sure that Im really nice and friendly to other food service workers because I understand what its like completely. With that being said, the UMall subways customer service is absolutely terrible, when I walked in I received no greeting, I walked up to the counter and a younger girl that worked there just stared at me blankly, I ordered my sandwich but had to repeat my order several times (it was just one sandwich), then they were terribly stingy with the veggies, and for the record I repeatedly asked for extra so that they would understand that I really wanted more bell peppers! After asking for more a third time the young girl turned to an older lady at the register, and said something in another language and they both started laughing. Now its possible they could have been talking about anything other than me, but I cant help but get the impression that it was indeed about me. When I got to the register, all the older lady said to me was, Meal?, and then snatched my card. I had noticed the total seemed a little high, so when I was trying to clarify what I ordered she rolled her eyes at me and then didnt say anything. At all. I had to repeat it myself, and she had charged me for a meal when all I wanted was a drink and a sandwich. All in all, I will absolutely never, ever again come to this Subway. The freshman can have it!

The Oak Tree Plaza is the only other Subway Ive been to in Davis, but its one of the best in terms of food quality. Theyre a little lacking in customer service, but they are by no means rude. And the sandwiches are GREAT! I never have a problem getting extra veggies. I just wished they stayed open a little later like the UMall one so I wouldnt have had to of gone there and received terrible service and a mediocre sandwich.  Users/jwieland1989

20120902 11:49:22 nbsp Random story: I was hungry for some Subway one night a few years back, so I decided to go to the one closest to my house  the Mace Boulevard location. It must have been about 9 p.m., so there was still like an hour before closing. I was pulling into the driveway when I saw someone outside smoking. Lo and behold this was the employee, who quickly ran inside. I debated for about a split second whether I still wanted to go there, because I frankly didnt want a sandwich made by someone I just saw smoking. So I made my way out through the gas station next door and went home.

Basically, sorry to whoevers smoke break I interrupted. I know cooks for sure smoke on their breaks and stuff, but to see it right as I was about to go in is pretty disgusting. Users/CecilioPadilla

   Oh man, if you think those two locations are bad, dont go to the one at UMall.  Users/BenLee

20130324 12:44:50 nbsp I eat Subway because Im poor but really have two complaints.  The franchise operation in Davis is overpriced: footlong is $6.50.  I mine as well goto Nugget at this point and pay $0.50 extra.  The $1.50 charge for avocado is high way robbery, again Nugget charges $1.00.  Yesterday I saw something pretty egregious.  A girl was visiting with her parents and the clerk had just finished making her sandwich.  At this point a line had formed behind them and the mother decided she wanted an additional sandwich.  The staff forced the mother to go to the back of the line and actually rang the girl up.  This is horrible customer service and just rude. Users/shraken

20140209 22:01:35 nbsp There are a lot of complaints about the service, but I think they are pretty good. Food is delicious, but the oven roasted chicken looks a bit bland. The vegetables look fresh and the stores are clean. Not much to complain about. Users/YoungResident
