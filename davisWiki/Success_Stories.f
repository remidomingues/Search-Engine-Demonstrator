Yellow lab lost and found in same day
LOST DOG: 4/3/14. Amador. Yellow lab, male. Shaved hindquarters from recent surgery.
Amador is a very sweet, friendly, lab who had ACL surgery a few weeks ago. Escaped from our yard on Elmwood Drive this afternoon. He is microchipped but his tags had fallen off his leather collar.


FOUND DOG: 4/3/14. An elderly male yellow lab was found at the intersection of Oak Avenue and W. 8th Street.
He has had recent medical attention as his left hind rump has been shaved.  he has been taken to the County Animal in Woodland.


We are watching Amador while our neighbors are out of town. He escaped from our yard and was found around the corner by a good samaritan who took him to the shelter. If his tags hadnt fallen off yesterday, or my kids told me they had fallen off so I could put them back on, the trip to the shelter (and the $75 reclamation fee) might have been avoided...but no matter, the important thing is that he is home!

Note that I didnt see the FOUND DOG notice when I added the LOST DOG notice, because the FOUND DOG notice has been added to the Wiki incorrectly and wasnt at the top of the page. I didnt bother looking through older posts. Another good samaritan saw the FOUND DOG post and contacted me.  Someone else pointed out Amadors picture taken by the shelter and posted on the HarborPet website.  Thanks to all of you for your help! What a great community!



Found after 3 months!
LOST CAT: 9/24/13. Moki. Buff orange medium hair
Moki has been missing since 9/24/2013 from our home near Adeline and Lehigh off of Pole Line. He has a collar with no tags. He is microchipped and ear tipped. He is usually friendly with people and dogs. Please call 702xxxxxxx if you see him. Thank you!

Update 12/21/13 from the http://www.facebook.com/?refhome#!/group.php?gid127394587271208&refts facebook group:

I would like to share some good news photos of Mokis first day back at home, safe and sound. He was missing for almost 3 months to the day, and since he left just a short time after we moved here, I felt little hope that I would ever see him again. All of you were so supportive and encouraging, and its because of this FB page and daviswiki that Moki is now home. Last night a woman from Vacaville named Linda was putting bags in her car at the Davis Target when a cat approached her asking for attention. She was surprised how friendly he was and was sure that he must belong to someone, but he had no collar. She Google searched lost cats in Davis CA and it brought her to daviswiki, one of the places where I posted Mokis photo. She called me right away, and I knew from the picture she sent that it was Moki, but he wouldnt let her pick him up. I was in Sacramento at the emergency vet with my dog and I had no idea how long I would be there so I immediately got on FB to see if anyone in the Pets Lost and Found Davis group could help wrangle him before I got back. Carol Ernst to the rescue!!!! Seconds later, Carol called me and was on her way to pick up Moki. As soon as I could, I drove to her house. I was pretty sure it was him but it was dark and hard to see inside the carrier, but I was hopeful. He meowed all the way home, and as soon as we got inside the house and I opened the crate, he stopped making noise and rubbed all over the dogs. It was him!!!! You cant imagine my happiness!!! I dont have much information about the amazingly thoughtful woman in Vacaville who was kind enough to actually search for me on the internet, but I will be eternally grateful to her for bringing my baby home. I couldnt sleep last night, even though Moki stayed right next to me because I still couldnt believe he was here. Thank you to everyone for your help in searching for Moki! Here are some photos of his first day at home.



Our Wayward Kitty April came back!!
LOST CAT:11/23/13. April. Female Calico
She was was gone for weeks, we wrote her off for dead after not finding her, but she appeared at the door, well fed and recently washed. She escaped her captors and was very jumpy for the first few days. She was a zombie, she did not respond to our affections and attempts to reconnect with her, but in the last few days she has finally returned to her secure and happy self. We dont know where she was, or what she experienced but she seems intent on staying home this time, she goes out less and stays nearby. We are glad to have her back home!



Found!
LOST CAT: 10/6/13. Agoshen. Grey Bobtail Cat
Large and Shy! Agoshen is a Green eyed grey neutered male cat with no tail. He is all grey but has some lighter grey markings. He is wearing an Orange velvet color with a brass tag that has the number 1 on it. He was last seen at home at 8th and M in Davis. Agoshen is 35 years old and probably weighs 1618 lbs now.

He has had a very difficult life, abandoned on a farm and nearly killed by wild animals we nursed him back to health and brought him home. He would go outside a little bit, but never wanted to roam. Even if you think you have seen him dead we would just want to know.

Recovered!
LOST DOG: 3/10/2013. Sasha. Dalmatianlike

though the spots are slightly blurry and she has collielike markings on her face. Chipped. Please call (530)7586178 if found,
her sister and family miss her.

Edit, 3/11/2013: That was fast, weve now been informed that she never went farther than Patwin school, and a little boy was walking around with her asking if
anyone knew who she belonged to. Thanks to everyone who called in so far!

Edit 2: It now appears that she chewed through the fence of the people who had found her, and she is now AWOL again. My worry is only balanced by the hilarity of the situation.

Edit 3, 3/12/13: Sasha is now home. It seems that she actually jumped the fence of the people who had her, spent the night wandering, and then somehow got back over the fence the next morning, at which point more communication resulted in us going to pick her up. Thank you to everyone who helped, and heres hoping Sasha has learned her lesson about being an escape artist!

Lost Cat: Female Brown and Black Tabby, named Cousteau (Found!)

 Lost Female Siamese Tabby Mix  North Davis / Saratoga West Apt Complex  FOUND!! 

Lost on 3/10/12 9pm from Saratoga West Apt Complex in North Davis (Covell and Denali)

Not wearing a collar but is microchipped.

Indoor only, has never really been outside, is probably very scared.

Blue Eyes, Greyish white with tabby markings on her face.

Please contact me at 4082308204 if you have seen her.


My bf and I had been searching all day. I had pretty much called it quits when my housemate convinced me to do one last search around 10:30pm. Im happy to say shes back safe at home! Its very true when they say cats can be a unresponsive to your calls during the day (when things are louder and scarier). If you have a lost kitty, I recommend grabbing a friend, a flashlight and a sound source that she responds to (in my case it was a tupperware filled with kibble which I shook as I walked). I also made it a habit of talking the entire way so that she would hear my voice. My housemate came along with a flashlight; it helps to see their eye reflectoins. We found her by her meows not more than ten feet from my apartment front door (despite the fact that we made the same desperate rounds just five hours before). Best of luck to all of you who are still looking!



Lost Cat Finally Found: Indy

Originally reported missing September 24, 2011, near the El Macero Nugget Marketplace on the corner of Mace and Cowell.

Hes finally home after three months of being out on his own. Based on the new missing line of fur across his nose (not pictured; images are from lost posting), he had a tussle with something. Besides being paranoid and a bit stressed out, hes safe and comfortable with a can of fancy feast and a big bowl of fresh water and my whole bed to himself.

A very caring couple around the block from my apartment complex noticed him coming around their house about a week ago. They fed him and he returned daily. Their neighbor called me after having noticed the similarity between that stray and my file at the SPCA and when I got home from my first day of classes today, he was curled up on their back patio table when I got there.

Thank you to everyone who looks out for these little lost pets. Im so overwhelmed right now. I cant believe hes back. Never give up hope!

LOKI is found!!!!
Loki is a neutered male chihuahua/doxie mix; he is about 6 years old.  His coat is dark brown with caramel markings on his paws, chest & face.  His face markings look a little like a mini pincher.  He is super friendly with people and will wiggle & roll over for a tummy scratch if you bribe him with treats or sweet talk.  He is a huge part of our family and we are missing him very very much.  He snuck out the front door on Thursday (7/14) around 9 or 10 pm.  He likely would have been picked up along Apple Lane, Drake Drive, Kent Drive, Sycamore Lane, Villanova or Anderson Road, or any of the intersecting streets in the neighborhood around the park on Sycamore Lane.  His favorite destination on evening walks is the little dog park there.  If you have seen him or have any information on his whereabouts, please please please give us a call at (530) 3044782.

 Winnie is safely HOME 

Thank you to the caller who helped to locate her, 5 days after she went missing.  Thanks to all of you for your concern!

Winnie was missing for 5 nights and days before she was found in the parking lot of the apartment complex where we live.  Tips I learned about trying to find an indoor cat who has gone missing: They tend not to travel very far, so focus search and advertising energy quickly within 23 blocks of where your cat has gone missing.
 1. If youve lost your cat, please be sure to contact the Yolo County Animal Shelter and ask about their Tips for Finding Lost Cats
 1. post fliers liberally in your neighborhood (in a circle defined by a 23 block radius from your home), and even make them larger than 8.5x11 if you can (e.g. 11x17).  If weather is likely to be wet, get them laminated and that also makes them more sturdy on stop sign posts; post them where there is people traffic  e.g. at intersections and stop signs, laundry rooms and mailboxes at apartment complexes, nearby grocery stores, nearby parks and playgrounds, vet clinics, pet stores
 1. contact local vet clinics and leave them a description of your missing cat, in case someone brings your cat in injured
 1. if you live in an apartment complex and see someone who seems to feed cats outside, talk to her/him  they may know a lot about local cats and whether there is anyone new theyve seen
 1. check local areas for your cat in the quiet of the night (e.g. after midnight) if it is safe to do so in your neighborhood, calling their name and scanning with a flashlight for eyeshine under bushes, under dumpsters, and under parked cars
 1. make fliers with your contact information and a good description of your cat (distinguishing features) and distribute them doortodoor in your neighborhood, so people have your contact information at hand if they see your cat.  Also let them know they can contact you any time of day or night and to please contact you immediately if they think theyve seen your cat
 1. there are additional ways to try to hone in on where your cat may be: there are individuals out there who work with trained dogs who can potentially help define an area where your cat is most likely to be (check Craigslist for scent hounds)
 1. seriously consider microchipping your cat.  Its not a GPS, unfortunately, but it can help people who find your cat get him/her back to you.  Also be sure to keep your contact information updated with Avid (they take phone calls 24 hours/day and are pretty friendly)
 1. also consider keeping a collar with ID tags on your indooronly cat (safety release may be a good option, in case it gets caught on something, it will safely snap off).  Yes, they are indooronly: only until they get out and you are looking worriedly for them
 1. listen to and take comfort from the encouragement of the people who tell you not to despair  that it can take time  sometimes many days or longer  for your cat to be found.  Dont give up, keep looking and asking for people to keep an eye out, and dont burn yourself out looking.  Pace your efforts and hope that it is just a short matter of time until your cat shows up.  Thanks to the people in the past week who helped me learn these things!  And thanks to those who take the time to check whether that cat they see out there is one that someone might be badly wanting home.

Cat Returned 10/15/10
 Our indoor cat got out on the evening of October 14, 2010 without our knowledge. We live in the downtown and a kind soul found our cat in Sophias and took him home. She posted a Pet Lost ad on Craigs List and took him to South Davis Veterinary Center in the morning. Between the Craigs List ad, the DavisWiki entry for our lost cat and the SPCA we were contacted about our lost cat! Now he is home and we are overjoyed! Definitely use every resource you can when trying to find a lost pet and be sure to microchip your pets!



Dog Returned 06/15/10
 My dog jumped out my car window on the evening of 06/13/10 in the Safeway/ Marketplace in North Davis. Fortunately, kind citizens of Davis were afraid of him getting run over and took him in for 2 nights before the pound opened. During my time of emotional stress, Cayce Wallace found my ad on facebook and reached out to help. She called me again this morning and informed me her friends saw him at the pound. Other concerned people called me to tell me they saw my dog at the SPCA while comparing it to the DavisWiki listing as well. Sincere thanks from the bottom of my heart to all those who helped my dog find his way back home. You have no idea how much it means to me! Dont lose hope out there if youre missing a loved one. Davis is a good town.



Found owner of grey tabby 21510
 Young female grey tabby showed up at a home near 5th & E around February 10th and stayed. Turned out she was pregnant. Got out when she was in heat and owners were away; she had no collar or microchip.  Owners wanted her to get pregnant because they like kittens, but so many kittens are euthanized in shelters why not adopt, or foster, instead?



Found owner of Found female chocolate lab 12/29/09
 Thanks to my roommate, who was helping me post fliers for the chocolate lab puppy I found, the puppy was returned to her owners who were driving by as he was posting the fliers.  Yipee!



RETURNED! Cat: lost 11/06/2009 returned 11/16/2009 Male Long Hair Tabby
 We got our kitty back!! Never underestimate the adventuring power of kitties, cause he went FAR all the way from 4th and A to the glacier point apartments, which is past 2 busy streets and a freeway! luckily someone had taken him in awhile ago, and when her roommate saw one of my fliers, she emailed me! you can NEVER put up too many fliers, and you should ALWAYS put them on campus I put mine in and around the MU and Silo, and apparently it worked!



 Cali kitty is home after 23 1/2 days of MIA. She called out at 1:00am and I called back and she came to the screen door. Happy ending!!



 Casper returned after 13 days, somewhat dirty and hungry, but clearly some kind soul had fed him and did not try to capture him.Thank you. Still, we are really glad we chipped him. SPCA was a wonderful source and support.



Babr came back after 3 weeks! We left the door open and one day found him in the apartment. Thank you to TANGLEWOOD apt for their help. they are VERY pet friendly :) 



Chester is home after 5 weeks!! Thanks to everyone who made it possible!

Please keep looking for Windy. She was spoted Sunday 8/24/08 at the Cannery Park empty lot at the end of J Street at Covell. Please Please keep looking.

Windy was lost Saturday 8/9/08. This is a YCSPCA foster dog that was rescued from the Nevada desert a while ago. Because she had little (if any) human socialization as a puppy, shes very shy (but not aggressive). She managed to get out of her foster home and is now missing in Davis, probably hiding.
WINDY IS FINALLY HOME after a month!



Dog: Satchmo

Satchmo was returned thanks to this website.  Thank you.




Kiki has returned! 8/13/08
Astonishingly, our fluffy little adventurer returned home on her own after a week of being gone (and worrying her humans beyond belief).  After 7 days (and 6 nights) of searching high and low, posting fliers, talking to neighbors/SPCA/local vets, posting on craigslist and here, and putting some of her used litter and bedding on the porch to provide a familiar scent, the orange furball decided to come trotting back home very early this morning!  My roommate heard some meows outside, opened the front door to check, and Kiki came zooming in.  Her fur is impossibly tangled up in leaves, sap, and burrs, so shes apparently been on a little trek.  Shes an indoor cat, so for her to have found her way home really is impressive...especially since that was the first time in 8 years shed gotten out (without supervision)!  Thanks to all who helped!  Were so glad shes back.



 Found: PRINCESS 
Nutmeg & Whittier.  She came home after being gone for almost a week, look like she may have been stuck in the sewer.




 Found: stray duck 
Vicinity of 10th and D.


   Does it answer to the name Hroðgar?  If so, and it has a black feather above the back of the left ankle, I think I might know who it belongs to.  Anxiously awaiting a reply...
    It dont answer nuttin. Duck has been returned to its human companion. pt

 Cat: Toby
Lost on 1/2/08, found on 1/17/08.
Thanks to many supportive people, mostly strangers! As I was instructed, I left small flyers at every house within a 23 block radius of the house. I took all the other advice, too, but eventually someone a few blocks over recognized him as the cat from the flyer and called me. He is fine, hes been eating, and appears unfazed by his 15day adventure which was extremely stressful for me and my family.
Thank you, everyone!! This is a happy day for us.





 Lost Dog: Reese

Dog: Black Lab Mix 810yrs old.

October 14, 2007
We found a very sweet and old black lab mix with lots of grey around his muzzle and paws.  He was first seen on Saturday, Oct. 13th near the intersection of L St. and Colgate.  Then, on Sunday, we spotted him again rummaging around the back of Osaka Sushi next to the CoOp on G St.  We have picked him up and are currently taking very good care of him, but would love to find his family if they are missing him.

RETURNED TO OWNER!  Owner had called in to Midtown Animal Clinic so when we took him there to check for a microchip, the staff already knew who he was!

 Cat:  Max : 8/24/07 
Max was found by a neighbor, 9 days after we had last seen him.  We put paper posters up in our neighborhood which generated several calls with news of Max, and his return.



 Cat: Bender 

Original Lost : 12/20/05   Our Bender is missing. Hes been a little lonely missing the rest of my roommates since break started. Anyways I came home to my apartent in Temescal last night and he ran out the door. Hes about 5 months old, grey and white, and has a cute bent tail (hence the name, Bender). I looked for him but cant really see anything at night. Its been raining so he probably was crying at someones door in Temescal (I hope). If youve seen him or happen to have taken him in on rainy night, please bring him home. Hes home is M4 in Temescal. Please dont let his mother come home to find him gone.
   Contact: Carlos, phone number or email address
   Lost Flyer: http://guatemaleco.noip.com/bender.html here

Found: 12/31/05  He was found by a girl down near E building, just wandering outside her apartment. She saw the poster I put up next to the mailboxes and called me. After getting back to her she brought him home to me. Aparently her cat was getting jealous of him. Hes still trying to run out the door whenever its opened. I think I gotta ask my roommate to get him a coller.




 Cat: Simba 
   Last seen: 1660 Drew Circle Apt 126, Saturday June 18.
   Found June 26th by Users/PhilipNeustrom and Users/KristenBirdsall

Users/KristenBirdsall Kristen and I were walking down Russell Blvd. on our way back from Jack in the Box, and we heard this one cat meowing really loudly.  It was sitting on the edge of this fence across from the International House.  The meowing was so frequent and friendlysounding that I went up to it.  It promptly jumped on my shoulders and rubbed itself all over me.  We knew that someone had been missing their cat, so when I got home I checked this page  it looked identical! I called up Users/KarlMogel and sure enough it was Simba! Users/PhilipNeustrom




 Cat: Loki 
Found and returned after three days by kindly Davisite who received one of our flyers. Our cat, Loki, according to his rescuer, was camped out under a house, crying incessantlyand this house was only one block away from our home, so our cat didnt go too far.  For those of you out there still missing your cats, just know this: s/hes likely alive, adapting somewhere in good health. Dont give up hope. In our hunt for Loki, we saw many cats roaming about (most without collars), and all of them looked healthy. Some cat owners in Davis feed their cats outside, so theres plenty of food within a oneblock radius to sustain multiple strays. Users/ZacharyNorwood ZN
