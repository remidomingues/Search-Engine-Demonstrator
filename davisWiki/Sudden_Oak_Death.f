Sudden Oak Death is a music scene local band that often plays the area. The members of the band are Grad Students graduate students from the History and Anthropology departments.

As far as I know, the band broke up a few months ago, possibly because one of the members left Davis. I dont remember where I read that, probably in the Aggie. Last July, they performed on Nexus Stage and I was lucky enough to help tape them  Users/JenniferChu JC
