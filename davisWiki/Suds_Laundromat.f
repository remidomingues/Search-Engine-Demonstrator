The facilities are decent. Just be prepared to spend at least $0.25/6 min. x 45 minutes to get your clothes dry. Also, if you want to retain your appetite for the day, have the staff clean the filters. You can find Buy 3, get 1 free wash coupons in the California Aggie. Also, dont forget to bring laundry detergent or fabric softener, or else you will have to pay $0.75 for each packet which is only good for one load.

Suds has a couple Arcades arcade games in a corner, Ms. PacMan on one, Xevios, Galaga and Mappy on the other.  There are more then a few tables and chairs (inside and outside) that are nice if you want to study or do work while you wait.  There are a couple different tvs, although one of them is always facing the service desk, so that the employees have something to watch. Snack and beverage vending machines are available, and they have free coffee if you get there early enough.


20060531 14:23:46 nbsp Between the general lack of creepy people, the relative cleanliness, the free coffee, and the TVs (doing laundry with a toddler in tow is actually tolerable!), this is probably my favorite laundromat in Davis. I generally spend 56 quarters (3542 minutes) to dry 2 large loads of laundry on high. Users/JessicaLuedtke

20070425 06:29:13 nbsp Suds is a good place to drop off laundry too.  Ive done my own laundry there, but its nice to just drop it off.  Most of the employees are friendly and the prices are OK, if a little on the high side. Users/Christopher

20080305 14:29:34 nbsp I used to love taking my toddler here once a week while doing laundry. However, one attendant refused to give me change for quarters because I had not brought all of my loads from the car and put them inside the washing machines. Even after explaining that I put one load in at a time because I am carrying my toddler AND the laundry she refused. Even though it was clear I was a return customer AND I had a load waiting on top of the washing machine she said she didnt want people to get money and not use the facilities. Her refusal to accommodate me has resulted in me taking my business elsewhere. Users/dettman
