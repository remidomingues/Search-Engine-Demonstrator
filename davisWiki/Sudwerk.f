Some German beer snobs say that this is the only beer that they will drink in California. The towns only microbrewery also makes some nontraditional beers, including a decent India Pale Ale IPA which seems to always be on tap now, despite formerly being listed as a seasonal.

Sudwerk Brewery’s Pilsner beer was awarded a gold certificate and took home the first place award in its category at the 2011 California State Fair’s Commercial Craft Brew Competition.  The California Craft Brew Competition takes place every year and is said to be among the most prestigious craft brewing competitions in the country. Sudwerk Brewery has won various awards in this competition over the years, including a Best of Show in 2010 and 1998.

In 2011, they entered into an agreement with UC Davis to produce Aggie Lager.  It is estimated that the proceeds from the agreement will fund $25k yearly in scholarships.  The logo for the beer is the Gunrock athletics logo, and can be spotted on the tap handle at the bar.  Its also for sale around town.

 Events 

Sudwerk hosts the annual Davis Beer Festival Beer Fest in early June.  The 2011 event was held on June 4. It typically brings more than 30 breweries with a total of more than 100 craft beers to taste. Tickets were $25 in 2007.  In 2011 they were $35 presale, $40 at the door.

They also host a large Oktoberfest event.

In August 2013 Sudwerk Brewery and de Veres Irish Pub hosted the First Annual Davis Bike and Brew Fest, a family friendly beer festival with unlimited tastings from over 50 breweries and 10 wineries. Proceeds from the event went to benefit the US Bicycling Hall of Fame. The event was held downtown in Central Park.

Beware: the beer served during Pint Nights is from the bottom of the barrelliterally.  According to someone who used to work there, they use Wed. nights to get rid of the beer they would otherwise deem unworthy to sell....  That explains the worsethannormal hangovers, eh?  Users/SummerSong ss

Do you also think that Natty and Keystone are from the bottom of Bud and Coors Barrels? There is no way thats true, the beers come straight from kegs and besides...the bottom of a barrel of beer is not bad beer it may have more yeast but in no way is it bad. Also, if anything it would give you LESS of a hangover since yeast at the bottom of the barrel have vitamins that help cure hangovers. Users/KegMiestyr kegman

Food is mainly pub food: Good snacktype food items: Garlic Parmesan Fries, and Avocado Egg Rolls, Fried Calamari, Onion Rings, etc.  They also have the best Chicken Wings buffalo wings in town.

They have live music on select Fri & Sat, 7PM10PM.  When its warmer outside.

As of February 4, 2005, the Sudwerk Restaurant and Brewery was for sale for $7 million. Prices since have fluctuated. See http://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/stories/2005/02/07/story2.html. Presently, though, Sudwerk is undergoing a transition into new ownership from Ron Broward to a new owner. The transaction occurred on July 1, 2006. Reportedly, Mr. Broward had trouble finding someone who would buy both the brewery and the restaurant together, not separately.

 

Sudwerk also sells their beer in kegs and has large banquet rooms that can be rented for business meetings, banquets, parties, etc. Parties of 25 or more are usually recommended to make reservations for these rooms ahead of time and have to pay a deposit and cleaning fee.


Keg prices are current as of July 2013, not including a $100 deposit (plus $40 for a tap).

There have been rumors that the Pints on Dollar Pint Night arent actually pints; that they are 12 ounces instead of 16 ounces. This is debatable. If filled to the brim, they are a full 16 ounces. They easily become 12 ounces if the head on the beer is big enough or if your cup isnt completely full, though.  Note that the confusion may result from the fact that a UK pint or beer pint starts out being larger (about 20%, 568ml vs. 473ml), plus the standard pub glasses allow for a head.  In fact, UK law has a head line on glasses.  Therefore, a Sudwerk pint is a US pint including head, while a traditional pint of beer is a 20% larger imperial pint and does not include the head.

If you like Sudwerks beer, and would like to try or buy some of their specialty brews, you might want to try going to the Sudwerk Brewery Dock Store!

20060919 21:43:11 nbsp I really dont care for their food, but I really, really care for their marzen and doppel bock. Mmm...doppel bock... Users/SteveKent

20060927 12:41:69 nbsp The food menu here has changed dramatically in the past month.  When I was here for a job interview on 8/13/06, there were lots of German plates and cuisine.  When I went back about a week ago, there was only 1 german item on the menu which was the sausage and German potato pancakes (very tasty!!).  Unfortunately, the sausage sampler platter I had when I was here in MidAugust is no longer on the menu.  The German cuisine has been replaced with your typical Applebees/TGIFridays pub grub.  Also, dollar pint night is definitely an interesting event.  When I was there last week, they seemed to be strictly enforcing the fact that you cant show up early and buy food and be exempt from paying the $3 cover.  All in all, a good place with solid beer.  For those of you who like their doppelbock, I would highly recommend http://www.ratebeer.com/Beer/ayingercelebratordoppelbock/1090/ Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock.  I am unsure of its availability, but your best bet would be one of the Nugget stores (both have a different selection of beer) or Aggie Liquor Users/CaseyBarc

20060927 13:48:28 nbsp I did a blind taste test with Sudwerk Doppel Bock, Spaten Optimator and Ayinger Celebrator and ended up picking Sudwerks. Users/KenjiYamada

20061017 23:27:17 nbsp My Girlfriend and I found out about this place shortly after we moved here a little over a year ago.  We have been eating here on and off since then, always impressed with the great food and excellent beer.  Myself and her parents (former restaurant owners) were chatting with one of the staff when he told us that the restaurant was under new ownership and that changes would happen.  He assured us that the only changes were going to be better tvs and other cosmetic upgrades, thats it.  We were quite excited by this assurance that the overall experience would remain the same ie. German food matching German beer.  Tonight, me and my gf went back and we found that the menu has essentially been destroyed.  There is almost 0 German food.  This is a German brewery, right? Part of the charm going here was getting German food as Sudwerk was the ONLY German restaurant in Davis. The menu now is  essentially TGI Friday food.  Many people who just came for the beer (Understandable as it IS some of the best beer anywhere), probably wont care, but for those that came for the whole authentic experience, they will be sorely disappointed.  Please, tell others, we want a unique experience, not some generic one we can find anywhere!!  Bring back the authentic food!!!   Users/JustusBranscomb
  As of 10/20/06, there is NO German food on the menu any more.  In the past week, they took the last German entree (Grilled Sausage with Potato Pancakes) off the menu.  I left a comment in their comment box voicing my intense displeasure.  Ironically, they dont have any comment cards and I had to use a scrap piece of paper. Users/CaseyBarc
  I second this (as of 06/01/07). Without having been there again, their new menu looks decidedly allAmerican, the only German dish I could find being their sausage platter. This is definitely not a German restaurant. I still like their beer, though  my hope is  thatll not go down as well, with brewery & restaurant now being separated. Users/JoFeuerstein

20061023 12:39:40 nbsp We are also very disappointed with the menu changes. This started at the Roseville location. Why go to the restaurant when you can get the Marzen at the store? Ill just come in to pick up the Doppelbock and go now.  Users/MyaBrn

20061029 9:23:12  I decided to go to Sudwerks after reading the German menu online. I was sorely disappointed to arrive at the restaurant and see NO German food on the menu. I can get a club sandwich at IHOP if I so pleased. Boo :(EricaMacGregor

    Can you update the entry above to say what kind of food they currently have?

    Heres the NEW menu: http://sudwerk.com/menu.pdf   (opens with Adobe) apparently they got on task and changed itEricaMacGregor

20061030 22:39:33 nbsp Im indifferent to the menu change. However, I ate there tonight and was quite pleased. The butter lettuce salad with walnuts and bleu cheese was tasty enough for me to eat nearly the whole thing, a rare occurance for a light eater such as myself.  Users/AnnaJones

20061109 16:29:49 nbsp Ive eaten here twice since the change in ownership. The first time was shortly after the change, and although I was really disappointed that the German food and the wonderful pubgrub was gone (goodbye, luscious onion rings), I thought that the menu was much more unified than the traditional Sudwerk menu, which seemed to be torn between bar food and german cuisine. I ate here last week, though, and it completely changed my opinion of the menu being more unified. Its all over the place. Four things that really bugged me last week: 1) the server preceded the description of four separate items with this is from the new owners other restaurant. Great, so this is some other restaurants food? Am I supposed to care? It completely turned me off. 2) Too many of the dishes seem like they have no chance of standing up to the beer being served. Maybe the Hefe or the Lager, but certainly not the Dunkelweizen, Doppelbock or others. The high number of seafood items just reinforces this. These beers (which I love) cant just go with anything, and I think the menu needs to reflect that. 3) They appear to have shorten their hours, essentially removing the bar aspect. 10 or 11pm? Those are clearly restaurant hours. This is supposed to be a brewpub as well. 4) What is the theme? We were given a dessert menu, and half of it was Italianinfluenced. Can eating crab cakes followed by tiramisu while enjoying a dunkelweizen work? Im not convinced. The absolute best change Ive seen is the additional beers on tap. Prior to the new owners I was never able to go there and choose between the standard beers and four others. The beers are still heaven, so Im still going, but I hope they continue to rework the menu. Its struggling both for an identity and a way to match the beer. If the name wasnt Sudwerk, Id bet the owner would ditch the beers completely. Users/MattCzarnowski

20061212 12:40:05 nbsp We went to Sudwerk last week. Overall, the atmosphere was quite nice, the beer was spectacular, and the service was great.  The food, however, was less than ideal. Some items were OK (the skinny onion rings I liked, my pasta was fine).  Other items were disappointing (my sister had a salad that she basically refused to eat, which is rare for her).  They clearly are not overly concerned with the quality of the food.  But I would go back, if just for the beer.     Users/JonathanEisen

20070109 21:45:10 nbsp Im drinking one of their doppel bocks right now.  Definitely good stuff, nice and flavorful. I tend to have a respectable quantity of Spaten Optimator on hand as my generic beer, but the Sudwerk packs more punch. I think I prefer the Spaten overall, not that the flavor is any better, but because I am not always in the mood for the rich bite of the Sudwerk, as good as it may be (and doppels are supposed to be hearty!). Ive tried a number of doppelbocks and so far my fave is definitely Weihenstephaner Korbinian. I like to have a bunch of them on hand at home at all times if at all possible. Users/DireDeparra

20070109 21:47:45 nbsp As for the food at Sudwerk, it used to be pretty good, with some generous portions.  I love German cuisine, and I was horrified to hear they pretty much eliminated it when the new owner took over.  Now it serves rather generic, if competant pub fare.  Completely redundant. Its this sort of thing that makes me depressed about life around here.  Now the ONLY place I know of that serves German (and Austrian) cuisine is Cafe Vienna in West Sacramento.  They have a fairly decent lunch buffet at a good price.  I havent eaten dinner there yet though.  I wish there was at least one other restaurant nearby that serves German food.  If there is one, I hope someone would let me know so I can rejoice and treat them to dinner for sharing the good news!  Alas, the only place I can get schnitzel on a whim is in my own kitchen.   Users/DireDeparra

20070206 20:02:00 nbsp i just logged on to the website. it says new hours: 11:30am to 10pm MonWed. does this mean no more 1$ pint night?!?!? im saddened, now instead of drinking 6 beers until the wee hours i have to pound a couple and bounce... LAME Users/EightFishies

20060302 20:47:00 nbsp In town for the weekend a tried out Sudwerks my first night in town based on the recommendation on this wiki. The beer is very good, authentic german lager style. I wanted to clear up a bit of stuff in the comments about weissbier in the W/NW US. Yes, Widmer is distributed by Anheuser Busch and they have a 40% ownership. The quality of all of their beers has gone down since. However, if you get a chance to goto the Widmer brewery in Portland, and try the Hefeweisen at the source, I think you will be pleasantly surprised. At any rate, comparing Widmer Hefeweisen to Sudwerk is like comparing apples and oranges  Widmer is a simple slightly sweet and yeasty weiss beer, but it is not authentically german  the Sudwerks beer has the authentic weisbier flavor. Pyramid, well, just sucks. As do the other breweries they have bought up (Macs for instance, was good before Pyramid bought them).Users/CalebPhillips

20070315 23:30:14 nbsp The BBQ burger is fantastic, but the appetizer platter if way too monotonous and greasy. Every item is fried, and the onion shreds work better as a side dish than an appetizer. The BBQ tri tip sandwich is really good, but the bread is a bit overpowering it would be improved by giving more meat or making the bun smaller. The mushroom burger is pretty good. I had the $2.50 nachos on Thursday fiesta night, and Id recommend you ask for chips with no toppings instead I enjoyed the chips, but the cheese was watery and conformed to no known dairy, nondairy, velveeta, or aerosol based cheese food product. It was supposedly made from an asiago, jack, and cheddar mix, but it was whey gross. Users/CraigBrozinsky

20070329 23:22:07 nbsp Sudwerk has gone really down, the food is not good, service is not good, beer is just ok.  New owners do not seem to care about the food or service.   over 45 minutes to receive any food, which was over cooked and under cooked.  we will pass the place till new owners take over, or it improves.   Users/JamesMorton

20070330 08:56:53 nbsp my favorite part about sudwerk was their onion rings, but now, with the new menu, they are like little tiny peices of onion, battered and fried and served...I dont want FANCY onion rings, I want real onion rings.   Users/RohiniJasavala

The beer continues to bring me through the doors. Users/AdamSchneider

20071113 20:35:50 nbsp I took my boyfriend here for his birthday tonight. Great service, great food but no birthday dessert! The new owner stopped having birthday desserts to cut back costs! So sad!  Users/Idunitt

20071115 08:24:27 nbsp I went with a large group last night (a professional crowdwe do this every month or so) to Sudwerk for dinner and drinks. We showed up at 7pm and ordered about $200 in food and drinks. After spending nearly $200 there, we learned that they wanted to charge us an additional $3 each ($27) so we could get more beer at dollar pint. RIDICULOUS!!!! They even tried to kick us out at 10pm since we werent there for dollar pint (but I was certainly not going to let them do that without giving me the rest of my liter of Marzen to go...) and they kept coming back to ask us when we were leaving.

The owners new policy is insulting! We wouldve likely spent another $50 in drinks that night (even with $1 pints) in addition to whatever we wouldve spent on future visits. We arent going to make that mistake again. Next time well go to Woodstocks where they know how to measure a pint and serve up the kind of food they advertise.

On a side note, I really doubt the owners new policy helps him rake in a large amount of extra income. During the 79pm transition, we noticed very few people stayed (now we know why) and the majority of the restaurant patrons were families anyway. As my friend put it, the new policy is penny wise, pound foolish. Users/CherieWilliams

20071129 19:24:46 nbsp They let me and my friends get food, drink beer, and play cards for hours on end. We mostly go because its the only place we can do this without it being too loud, at and the beer is delicious. The food is alright. Users/ChristyMarsden

20080209 09:15:27 nbsp this place has HORRIBLE service. on a thursday night, my friends and i just left. beforehand, we ordered appetizers (good kalamari), but this waitress with a red shirt and blond, ponytail hair was walking over and rolled her eyes at us. it seemed like she was irritated by us, even though it took forever just to find her in the bar. my friend actually had to walk around the entire place to find a waitress who knows NOTHING ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE. Her tone didnt help either. Users/mikam

20080406 13:33:04 nbsp Went there with my family over spring break. I had the santa fe sandwich which was amazing. My Grandma ordered shrimp  pasta. They neglected to put the shrimp on the pasta the first time, so it got sent back. Only 2 minutes later and it was back on the table. You could definitely tell that they had put frozen shrimp on top and microwaved it. Nonetheless it tasted like crap, so she got a burger instead. I would suggest their burgers and sandwiches, with the amazing fries. I would avoid the other entrees. I will be returning, especially to try more beer, its nice to have a local brewery in town.

20080927 23:30:30 nbsp I havent been here in maybe 8 years because of terrible service I got here. Since I havent been back since the change in the menu I decided I would give it a try. For some reason, we had to wait half an hour for a seat for our party of 4 when there were no less than 13 tables available inside and half a dozen outside as well. These tables remained open for our entire wait and the entire time we were dining as well. I ordered the chicken and when I finally got it (the rest of my party was done eating) it was completely undercooked. Parts of it were still pink and raw and bloody. Since im not a fan of salmonella, I sent it back (which I have never had to do).  After we left everyone felt sick to their stomach and one of my guests threw up shortly after. Its safe to say I will not be eating here at least for the next 8 years. Love the beer, but its not worth it. Users/Cole

20081107 23:10:30 nbsp The place is worth going to for the beer, but not much else Im afraid. Service isnt that great and the food is a major disappointment.

20081206 02:28:59 nbsp I dont know what everyone is complaining about. First of all, as a vegetarian, they have a quite few options (pizza, a pesto pasta dish, veggie burger, salads) to choose from. The portion sizes are generous, and the servers are friendly & efficient. The beer is delicious, and well priced (a LITER for only $6!). I LOVE going to Sudwerks with my friends for drinks after work or to grab a bite to eat on my lunch break.  We usually have the same server, and she is always great! (I think her name is Shawnna or something close to that). Sudwerks is definitely a fun place to go.  Users/JazzyJasmine

20081221 23:35:06 nbsp NEVER EVER AGAIN. I have been to sudwerks before on dates and once for a work meeting, but Friday night I had the worst service of my entire life. I made a reservation and we were seated and served drinks, and everything seemed honkeydory. We were waiting on two other friends and so we asked our waitress if she could wait a few minutes before we ordered...she didnt seem to have anything to say to this and simply walked away. Our friends arrived and our waitress came by and asked if we were ready to order, we said we werent because our friends had just sat down and didnt even have any menus, and then she ROLLED HER EYES and said ugh, whatever. WHAT? We were kind of shocked at that response...was it really such an inconvenience that we needed an extra few minutes to wait for our friends and allow them to pick something to eat? When we were ready to order, we closed our menus and waited. 30 minutes (i am not kidding here) later we decided to stack our menus up at the end of the table to see if this would catch our waitress attention, and it did. We ordered. Notice that the first girls to sit down had been sitting for 45 minutes already, and no drink refills. Another 30 minutes later (one of my friends was timing because she had to be home by a certain time) we received our food. One of my friends ordered a cheeseburger with cheddar, but the cheese on the burger was clearly swiss...still our waitress reassured us that it was cheddar and did not offer to verify this. My friend ate a few bites of her cheeseburger and decided not to finish it, we had already spent so much time in the restaurant that she didnt want us to wait for a new burger. After we had finished eating we waited another 20 minutes before my friend (the timer) decided to get up and ask for our check. After we handed our check and credit cards in, we finally were given our first refills of the night. Over 2 hours after first being seated, we were finally able to go (at this point all of the other couples and families who had been seated around us had already left). The service was painfully slow and sometimes outright rude, maybe they are understaffed...or maybe our waitress was having an off night (or she may have been hideously drunk)...still, we didnt tip (this is a first for me) and I will never return.

20090428 11:15:37 nbsp I really like the beers and the bartenders: Katrina, Shauna, Rob and Sean. All are friendly
and offer good service. Mark, the manager, grew up in Davis with his brothers and knows a lot of the customers, me included. Among my favorite dishes are the Shrimp Louie Salad, Sauteed Chicken Piccata and the Grilled Salmon. The hamburgers are excellent. Go there on a Thursday night for karaoke. They have a great selection of songs and some of the staffers like Mark, Zach, and Mel will get up and sing along with the customers.  Users/nowhereman

20090531 05:30:26 nbsp Im sad about the change in ownership, still. Im halfGerman and do love German foods, so I was sad to see a lot of the traditional German and Slavic items go off the menu. They did keep a couple of good ones, though, so that is some comfort.
One thing anyone that comes here should try is the sausage sampler. I LOVE the chicken apple, but the others are very tasty too. As Im under 21, I cant really say much about the beer. ;D My dad very much likes it, so Ill just have to take his word for it. Working at a hotel, though, whenever Im asked by a guest where to find some good drinks, this is where I send people. Users/KBathory

20090614 12:46:33 nbsp the food here was good but the service makes me not want to come back. they forgot one of our orders, the waitress almost never came to check up on us. we asked for some ketchup three times. it was never brought to us and we had to go to a table nearby and ask to borrow their ketchup. the waitress never even refilled our water, not once throughout the 2 hour experience. it sucked that there was a gratuity charge because she definitely did not deserve a tip that big.  Users/skinnyfatgirl

20090615 17:42:05 nbsp Went here recently for dinner. The food was mediocre for the price; I got the sausage plate and was underwhelmed, especially by the Bratwurst. My companions got a pizza and a burger, both were equally underwhelming. The beer however, was good as usual. I dont believe they serve a bad beer.

Service was lax, it is a big place though and I imagine its hard for one or two servers to efficiently cover the whole place.  Users/JamesWaterhouse

20090724 02:30:05 nbsp WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!!!!!!  Ive lived in Davis my whole life and this is seriously the most horrible service I have ever experienced.  They need to close this place down or get new owners.  Our waitress was extremely rude.  We needed ketchup, water, and soda refills and got none of the above.  We probably got one drink refill at the end of our less than appetizing meal.  And honestly, the potato wedges that are supposed to be french fries are tastier at KFC.  That, in itself, says a lot about this place.  I dont think Ill be returning here anytime soon.   Users/sm0729

20090808 13:46:50 nbsp Sudwerk is really a very sad story.  They have what is probably some of the best tasting beer you could hope for in a local brewery.  Authentic taste and well made.  I love living in Davis and knowing that Sudwerk is our local brew.  And then, there is the food and service.  Seriously, I dont think the new owner really cares about the quality of the food they serve.  Consistently since we relocated to Davis in 2007 every time we have gone to Sudwerk, lured by the excellent beer, we have had what can only be described as some of the worst food we could imagine.  Our most recent visit included:  a bacon avocado burger that was topped with completely brown, oxidized and totally unappetizing old guacamolea least thats what we assume that it was supposed to be.  What is amazing about that is that someone in the kitchen had to reach into the tub that was stored in and spread it on the bun.  And it was not just brown and oxidized on top, it was brown through and through.  So clearly, no one cared to even think about what was being served or was even concerned about putting a quality product up on the pass.  The only thing to top that was the mysterious thing in the fried potatoes.  Was it a bone from a pork chop?  Did one of the staff loose a finger when they were prepping the potatoes for service?  I am not sure what the thing was, but it was not particularly appetizing to bite into.  Examining only enhanced the sense that I had just tried to take a bite out of something clearly not potato.  My club sandwich was unremarkable.  Sadly this is exemplary of every meal I have ever had there.  I even tried to take a group of sales people there after a meeting one night.  The comment from the entire party was, Well, the beer was great; but the food sucks!  Unanimous opinion with no dissent.  The sad thing is that given the limited depth of the all to familiar American pub grub menu, it is not food that takes particular skill to make well.  But it does require at least the minimal interest of the kitchen staff to make it better than just barely edible which seems to be the standard to which Sudwerks kitchen aspires.  If I were the owner, I would fire the entire kitchen and seriously consider replacing the manager if that is the best that they can do.  In summary, go for the beer, but unless you have absolutely no taste for decent food dont eat there. Users/ctotten

20090815 22:33:07 nbsp Tonight we decided to take my son and his grandparents to Sudwerk for a “last meal” together before his heading off to college.  We were hoping for a great night. Told the wait would be 20 minutes  reasonable.  After 35 minutes, we were told that there were no tables outside, but we could have an inside table until something outside became available.  Took the inside table and ordered immediately with senior citizens long waits aren’t welcome.  After 35 more minutes, we called the manager (and his trainee) to the table to express that “this wasn’t a good night for us at Sudwerk’s.”  We then heard a LECTURE from the manager about how we should have made a reservation and delays such as what we experienced would not be unusual for evenings with music.  We weren’t satisfied with this response.  (To their credit, the manager and trainee then hustled back to the kitchen and brought the food to the table (thanks).) On the way out we again expressed our disappointment with the evening.  Seemed to fall on deaf ears.  I notice an entry on the Davis Wiki that patrons question if the manager really cares about customer satisfaction... hmm, based on tonight’s experience I wonder also.  Not sure how fast we’ll be back, if at all.  Users/clb2

 It sounds pretty reasonable to say you should make a reservation if you dont want to be waiting for long on a night with live music.  You wouldnt expect the manager to give you a table before other people who had been waiting longer, would you?  What else could he have done?  Users/KenjiYamada

20090828 16:42:01 nbsp I know people tend to write reviews more frequently when theyve had a bad experience, so Id like to add my 2 cents: i love sudwerks! I think the manager(s) are great and DO seem to take their job seriously, unlike some of the robots Ive experienced (both while dining and working in the industry). I do agree with a couple of the negative comments, though  the service, im sorry to say, IS ALWAYS slow. Ive had a few different servers, and regardless of how busy it is, I do not feel like they have ever been instructed on checking back once or twice throughout the meal (because, as I would hope youve recognized, servers are managed very differently in different restaurants). Once to see how everything is, twice for drinks/to see if its still going ok and to give the diners an opportunity to ask for the check early if theyre in a hurry. Secondly, the calamari!! It used to be my FAVORITE thing ever there! It was greasy before (which is not always a bad thing, everyone craves greasy food at some point), but now its just teensy little pieces that I feel like i have to wipe off with a napkin...or maybe wring out. But theyre so small theres not much I can do, they used to be huge and delicious. I have no complaints, other than that I have always had great experiences. If youre in a hurry  get InNOut. Or, HEY! Let your server know at the beginning of the meal! Users/dontworryaboutit

20090904 20:40:03 nbsp By far the worst experience at the local brewery!!! Have been going to Sudwerks regularly for the past 12 years. Tonight was unbelievably terrible. The hostess was wonderful but following that our time was awful. Our server, if you could call her that, took 20 minutes to even acknowledge our existence. Finally she reluctantly spoke to us, clearly upset with the rest of the staff for not letting her know that they had seated people in her section. We paced our order quickly for fear that we may never see her again. When the food came out (all ordered off the appetizer menu) we were wishing our server had never acknowledged us in the first place. Ordered the app. sampler, fries, seared artichoke, and a cup of chowder. Not to difficult. Sampler cost us $12.75 for two halves of a chicken strip (I know that would equal 1 whole strip only the size of the 2 halves were less than 1 strip), 5 onion rings, 2 halves of an egg roll (same explanation as the chicken on the 2 halves bit), and a handful of calamari. Artichoke was not cooked and the fries were equivalent to the fires I would pull out of the freezzer for my kids on a busy night. All in all, if we didnt have our beer, it would have been a disastrous night. Thank god for beer, for it can mask just about anything! Horrible new owners...if your looking for a good burger and a great selection of beer check out Burgers and Brew downtown.  Users/suebee

20090916 14:29:47 nbsp My roommates and I went there last night. The beer is okay, but the service was terrible. It was a slow night there, but our waitress still took forever to serve us. We had already finished our meal by the time our beers came. We noticed that the bar tender had poured them about 10 minutes before the waitress finally served them to us. We had to ask her to bring new ones because they were already starting to get warm. We never even got a water refill during the meal. Terrible. Weve decided never to go there again. Users/craiggilmore

20090916 17:01:40 nbsp I like their Pilsner but I havent had it on draft.  Their beer costs a little bit less at the market than most other premium or microbrews, which is certainly nice.  Coming from three years in Chico it is hard for me not to support the local brewery!  Given the kind of food they serve at the restaurant, and its location, I likely wont go, but if I do, Ill review it. Users/RyanMikulovsky

20091026 09:07:00 nbsp We were once long time patrons of Sudwerk for years, but the last few times weve dined there weve found the food to be marginal quality and the service to be merely acceptable.  We brought out of town company in, and were so terribly embarrassed we wont likely be returning.  I dont want to name her, but our server (or should I say Order Taker) was inattentive, absent and not even the slightest bit friendly.  We had to ask numerous times for just about everything (napkins, ketchup, crackers for our fidgety toddler, water, bread that came with the salads).  Our friendly blonde busperson ended up doing all of the work, so we slipped her a personal tip on our way out.

Also, the Santa Fe sandwich I ordered was kid sized, and I had to eat again when I got home (Im a normal sized guy with a normal appetite).  I wanted to order the wing side dish, but I was shocked at the $12.75 price tag for 12 wings.  Exhorbitant.

So, Im sure well end up in the restaurant again as nostalgia for the good ole days kicks in.  Im assuming as relatively new owners, there are still kinks to work out.  Ill hope for the best. Users/skawt01

20091111 10:49:53 nbsp I miss the old menu, especially the warm German potato salad. I had a burger here the other night. I asked for it to be done Medium well. It was burnt on the edges. They do have some excellent beer and the best calamari (with chipotle mayo) I have ever tasted. Make sure you get a fresh batch of the calamari. It gets soft if it has been sitting under the warming lights for too long. Users/GJC02

20100302 04:29:17 nbsp The servers here are so incredibly shady. A couple of my friends and I headed out to Sudwerks, I was DD so I only have 2 beers while I was there. My friends decided to get sloshed. Our total came out to $12 and change, I gave the waitress a $20, she comes back and gives me a couple coins for change thinking we wont notice because most of the group seems hammered. As shes walking away, I have to yell at her to come back to give me the 7 remaining dollars. She got no tip.

Yes the beer is AWESOME and the food is pretty good, but why in the world would I ever return to an establishment that treats their customers like this? Until they straighten up Sudwerks will not be receiving my business or positive mention. Users/davisreviewer

  I thought DDs arent supposed to drink at all. Also, howd you have to drinks, your friends get sloshed and the bill come out to only $12? How cheap were the beers that night? And how many beers does it take for your friends to have gotten sloshed? Sorry if I sound mean, Im just confused by this story.

20100312 16:16:17 nbsp Ive been going to Sudwerk for a long time.  The food is great, but the service is consistently bad.  Never come for dinner unless you have at least two hours to spend.  When you make reservations, tables are rarely ready when you show up.  Instead, it seems like you just get bumped to the front of the waiting list when you arrive.  A typical wait with reservations is 10 minutes or so.  They also drastically understaff.  Not enough people busing tables, not enough waiters, and apparently not enough cooks, either.

That said, if youre there with good company and will enjoy talking while youre waiting, its a great place to go.  The food is very good.  Their burgers, their salads, and their pizzas are all quite good.  Their chicken wings are the best in town.

The beer itself is alright.  The Marzen is pretty good, the IPA is decent, and a few of the seasonals are solid.  Last time I had the Hefeweizen (several years ago, admittedly), it was complete crap.  It was so malty it tasted, in the words of my wife, like meat.  I like intense beers of most varieties, but it was just disgusting.

Frankly, I think their decision to save costs by understaffing is a poor one, as they undoubtedly lose customers.  When Ive got plenty of time for a tasty dinner, though, Sudwerk is still one of my top picks.  The wings are just too damn good to pass up! Users/TomGarberson

20100403 23:00:29 nbsp I had high expectations about Sudwerk, BUT after eating in this establishment I was VERY very disappointed with the food. I ordered the Sudwerk salad, very bland taste it had, very few pieces of chicken, if any, it was as if I was eating a whole bowl of iceberg lettuce  seriously not worth the $12 I was going to have to pay. Without a doubt, I had to send the plate back. I was pleased that the waiter allowed me to choose another plate, I ordered a veggie burger. Not surprisingly, I was not pleased whatsoever. The hamburger buns were cold, the lettuce and onions were staled, the portion reminded me of a Happy Meal from McDonalds. Dont get me wrong, I am not a picky eater, at all. But my experience at Sudwerk was a total nightmare!!! Just go for the beer, not the food, I highly discourage going there for dinner.   Users/hgonzalez

20100410 18:33:32 nbsp I came and had the clam chowder. It was nearly inedible and the food I tried of my friends was bad too.

20100509 19:04:35 nbsp Sudwerks is not so bad if you know what to expect!! Ive never had to wait for a table, and Ive gone there for dinner every day of the week at one point or another. I agree with the slow service  that part is true without a doubt  but like I said, now that you know what to expect, its not so bad. Some people like to eat dinner and move on, and some people like to visit and hang out. I feel like the food is a little pricey, but that may be because I am perpetually on a college student budget.  Also: chinese chicken salad is awesome.  Users/mooodavis

20100527 15:18:50 nbsp I really enjoy Sudwerk beer, but I have only tried the hefeweizen and IPA so far.  I have to get a keg this weekend; any suggestions as to which beer from Sudwerk would go down the best for binge drinking? Users/ScottMeehleib
  My top picks are the IPA and the Marzen.  The lager is a fairly easy drink, but not that interesting IMO.  IPA is too bitter for a lot of folks, and the hefe is too disgusting for a lot of folks (not that Im biased or anything...).  My recommendation would be the marzen for a mix of mass appeal and tastiness.  BTW, the Coop has a great selection of beers available to order by the keg... not sure how long they take to get, though.Users/TomGarberson

20100624 13:08:17 nbsp I went to Sudwerk this past Monday night for dinner with a group of 10 and we had the best service Ive ever experienced there.  Servers are always friendly, but Ive usually had long wait times before.  This week, though, our waitress came by promptly, was friendly, brought drink orders quickly (theyve taken 10+ minutes sometimes in the past), and brought our food out pretty quickly (probably about 1520 minutes; its taken 30+ minutes sometimes in the past).  The place wasnt crowded at all, but again, Ive had bad service in the past when it was almost empty.  Maybe we just got lucky, or maybe theyre improving things... either way, it was a really great experience.  They were out of the IPA, though, which was a bummer.  Their extra pale is still solid, though.  And they still have the best hot wings in town. Users/TomGarberson

20100626 15:29:41 nbsp The current staff is doing a good job. The women bartendersKatrina, Shauna, Paulaare cute, friendly, and have a good sense of humor.
Paula is also a very talented singer. Donovan and Cormac are great cooks. The only drawback is that Sudwerk closes earlier than many bars,
especially on weekdays (with the exception of Pint Night). You may get last call at 9 pm on a Sunday or Monday.

20100626 23:43:59 nbsp Sudwerk is a good restaurant to go to if you are super hungry. They have variety of pastas that are very filling, the jambalaya is really good. They have a great selection of tasty burgers and a good tritip sandwich. I think their guacamole bacon burger is very yummy. I tried a bite of their veggie patties and it was good too, and i usually dont like those.  I also really like the brewmaster schnitzel and the pan roasted marsala chicken. Dont miss the buffalo wings on pint night, or any night for that matter. They have excellent desserts too, their brownies are so good sometimes I think theres weed in them.   Users/reviewaskew

20100719 08:45:13 nbsp AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!!! Based on the fact that Sudwerk has good beer, I was expecting an equally pleasant dining experience and could not have been more dissapointed. The food was terrible, portions were very small, and the prices were exhorbitant. Before the new management took over the food was very good and reasonably priced, but it seems like the new mentality is to cut corners and maximize profits at the expense of the patrons. Needless to say I will never be back. Users/Furly707

20100807 21:17:05 nbsp My friends and I have come here a few times because it is convenient and they can accommodate a lot of people.  Every single time the service is so slow!  It takes forever to get your food and forever to get any other type of service.  The most recent time was about 2 weeks ago and again, it was extremely slow.  I understand that service can be slow on busy days but there were a ton of servers and not many customers around.  I dont recommend it unless you want to wait around a while to eat. Users/themichelle

20100811 11:39:20 nbsp Sudwerks is only good for one thing  beer. A while back, I was sitting at the bar during pint night, and a cockroach started walking across the bar in front of me. I really felt inclined to say something since there was food all over the place  so I went over to the manager and told him, and his response was oh yeh, I already know about that, well take care of it later. This is absolutely astounding to me. I come from a family in the food business, and to have cockroaches in your establishment, needless to say that management knew about it and didnt even care, is shocking. I would never EVER eat here because of this. I almost wanted to call a health inspector. Overall, great place to drink for the buck on pint night (just make sure to check your cup), but this issue coupled with their bad customer service makes me not eat there. Users/aggie2009

  Yeah, anyone who hasnt been here in a few years should try it out.  Theyve dramatically improved the food.  Service varies somewhat, but its never terrible; just a bit slow sometimes.

One thing Ill say: I hate that stupid dirt parking lot.  I dont know whether Sudwerk owns it, or just has rights to use it, but they badly need to pave it or at least redo it to fill in the 10footwide potholes.  I doubt it would be safe for someone with a car with low clearance to drive through there. Users/TomGarberson

20110521 21:23:03 nbsp We had a mixed experience last night.
There was a 35 minute wait, but a bunch of empty tables (Id estimate at least 30% of the restaurant was empty).
The avocado egg rolls were REALLY tasty, but six oneinch pieces are definitely not worth $8.
I got the fettuccine alfredo. It was adequate, but nothing I couldnt make at home. I liked the tomatoes on it fine, but they werent mentioned on the menu which is strange since tomatoes are not standard for the dish.
My partner got the bleu cheese and bacon burger with fries. The fries were (not my words) meh. I had to agree, and the fry portion was tiny as well.
The main problem was with the burger. It was ordered medium, and it came out rare, possibly raremediumrare at best. Um, gross. We asked for it to be thrown back on the grill for a few minutes... the nice thing is after waiting a while they sent out a whole new burger (and fries... which, if added to the previous portion, would almost match other restaurants in town). The notsonice thing is this time it came out well, instead of medium. Super dry, but my partner was really hungry after waiting so long and would rather eat it than wait another halfhour for them to give it a third try. I also kind of thought the manager might come apologize since undercooked ground beef is a pretty egregious error, but nope!
They could also use more vegetarian choices.
The best part was the service. Our waitress (I think her name was Kimberly) was very nice and apologetic about the burger even though it obviously wasnt her fault. Users/MeggoWaffle

So for the past week or so Ive been sick (what kind of loser gets sick in the summer?). I finally got tired of feeling the need to sleep 12 hours a day and the headache I had from a congestion so I take some pseudoephedrine and some caffeine. Of course, this combination is a somewhat effective appetite suppressant. So I really had to force down food most of the time while on the combination but when I was having some of their onion rings, potato wedges, chicken tenders, and stuff I actually ate enough that I gained and maintained at least five pounds of water weight the next day. Yep, theyre so good, appetite suppressants fail to make them hard to eat. Users/hankim

20110818 09:29:29 nbsp Pint night has changed.  Sadly this night is no longer without cover if you get there before 9:00pm, and it also now starts at 9:30.  Staff was extremely rude and thugish when they confronted us about not having wrist bands rather than simply explaining their current policy.  Furthermore our DD was forced to also purchase a wristband even though she had no interest in drinking their alcoholic beverages.  This ruined the experience that Sudwerks previously had delivered.  I certainly do not enjoy going out for entertainment and drinks only to leave feeling angry and wronged.   We wont be back.   Users/iVeterinaryStudent

20111012 22:36:27 nbsp Dear Mark,

Consider this a formal complaint in regards to your business policy of no backpacks on dollar pint night. After having a rough day, all I was looking forward to was relaxing with some friends in what I thought was a friendly environment. I live within biking distance, so to be a responsible consumer of alcoholic beverages, chose to ride my bike to your business on Wednesday night. Also, due to the fact that I am a girl, I do not carry my wallet on my person. Normally, I bring it in a purse or handbag, but since those are not conducive to bike riding, I chose to put my belongings in a backpack. Upon entering your lobby, I was promptly told No backpacks allowed. When I questioned the reasoning for this, I was told it was due to avoiding people sneaking in their own personal alcohol. When I offered to have my backpack inspected, all three of your lovely bouncers refused me. One questioned if I had a car to put it in, and I obviously said no, since I rode my bike. Another asked if I had anything valuable in it, and suggested I remove any items of value and leave it in the entryway. My backpack itself is worth over $100, and this is a college town full of sociopathic students who would LOVE a free backpack, so of course I told him that was not an option. The bouncers gave me contemptuous glares of too bad. After having such a trying day, this was the very last straw. I am irate over this idiotic policy, especially given that just last week I was at your pint night and had a giant purse with me, at least the same size of my backpack, which was not questioned or looked at twice. Dont you think a college student could sneak alcohol into your establishment with a purse? Your bouncers logic is fundamentally flawed, and their attitudes were rude and unacceptable. Next time you hire, consider individuals who dont act like thugs and let their $8 an hour jobs manifest into a pathetic power trip.

Suffice to say, I will never return to your brewery. I am beyond upset by this incident, and my friends are joining me in boycotting your establishment as well as all of your products. Look for my reviews on Yelp and DavisWiki as well. I hope this is a wake up call for you to address your severly defective business practice.

Sincerely,

20120621 11:32:47 nbsp Apparently stacking empty pint cups is dangerous or hazardous! We were at Sudwerk last night and commenced in the stacking of the cups when out of nowhere an angry Asian bouncer guy came and shouted at our table, Take that down NOW!. I think our tower was 45 cups high, nowhere near a Sudwerk record. We took down the cups but seriously, does it take passiveaggressive bouncers to do the work of waitresses? Doesnt look good on the service side to a table of eight. my 2cents Users/ucdMBAguy

20121212 17:11:55 nbsp This place makes me sad. I came here in my college years to get German food. Now the owner has sold out and eliminated the German food, and added the same stuff every other pub has to its menu. The owner even has the bad judgment to now put an Asian menu on the menu.  This is a GERMAN restaurant that doesnt know what it wants to be. Nearly empty last night.  I will never go back.  And owner,  schnitzel is not supposed to be made with a thick ece of chicken. Horrible. Users/DonnieDarko
