20110426 09:30:33 nbsp As of 4/23/11, two of the beers on tap are projects made by students in the Master Brewers program, which I think is pretty awesome. One is lavender infused. Another on tap is the MarBock, which is a blend of MaiBock and Marzen. Users/MattCzarnowski

20110426 11:08:36 nbsp Good beer, good people, and pretty decent prices. I just recently bought their membership thing, and Ive bought at least 5 growlers of beer thus far. Users/JoePomidor

20110426 21:06:37 nbsp The Mar Bock is actually one of the brewers creations.  They have come up with some pretty good blends, and have ideas for lots more. When we put the MaIPA back on everyone should try to get some, its pretty tasty.  The Lavender Pale was my little experiment.  I might do a partial keg of IPA we have, people seemed to like it.  The Master Brewers student beers havent been on tap in the dock store, they share them with the other students on the taps in the classroom though. Users/BrennanFleming

20140211 13:37:29 nbsp Everything about this place is great and I go often, but last time there was a problem with the logistics of the mug club. I bought into it recently and was given a mug that was filled no problem on my next visit. However, two of my housemates also bought into it and were denied refills on their mugs. They were told that they needed a card and that the mugs are supposed to stay at the dock store. They ended up getting their mugs that they paid for taken away. I just want to bring attention to this so that it can be fixed...each employee seems to have a different idea of how the system is supposed to function. Otherwise, it is awesome to have great beer being brewed in Davis. These guys have done an awesome job bringing Sudwerks back to life.  Users/JakeNeustadt

20140216 16:58:04 nbsp Jake, Im sorry for mug club mistake.  We have some new employees and like everything else, it takes time to become an expert at your job.  I certainly remember that you and your roommates are all mug club members, and Ill fix this the next time you come in.  Cheers! Users/PhillipEmerson
