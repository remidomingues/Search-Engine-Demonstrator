20110329 14:34:11 nbsp I objected to the language used to convey his thoughts, for whatever purpose. I dont feel it is ever appropriate to use vulgarity on any information style site. Period. I responded to Meg due to the fact that the only part of the entire thing on the Ban Josh Lawson page was the sexist statements. While I agree with this, it skipped the entire point of the page in general and focused on one part. She is trying to turn it into a male vs. female forum and it is not, not one of us feels that any of the statements made by Josh were appropriate and they go far beyond the few instances of gender usage or insult.  The statement I made People like you... refers to the people who skip everything that was being discussed and find the one small grain they can relate to or disagree with and base their entire opinion on that, if not attempt to redirect the entire conversation to that topic, as Meg did on the page.

I hold no tolerance for anyone who uses such terms, nor do I hold any for people who try to manipulate a topic to suit their own agendas as she did. Users/WesP

20110329 18:03:14 nbsp Thanks for your comment, Sue. I understand where you are coming from and I wouldnt blame you for being concerned about the threat of violence if a man used those terms to you. I left a reply to Olivia which clarified my viewpoint a little more, but I will repost it here because the Ban page may be deleted soon, and I thought you might be interested in reading it.  I know this is getting offtopic, but I cant resist replying because this an interesting topic and Olivia raised some stuff that I hadnt thought about before. I see how the threat of rape could definitely concern a woman, particularly in facetoface encounters where a man uses those sorts of terms. Politically and financially, however, it seems as though women may eventually eclipse men in terms of power, so I think that is one reason why bitch, at least in some situations, doesnt always carry the same sense of horror for the general population as, say, the nword. American women are clearly pushing back hard from their historic oppression, with something like 60 percent of women attending college compared to 50 percent for men. Many blacks, on the other hand, are still struggling in marginalization and their college attendance figures and graduation rates are much lower, which is uncomfortable evidence that racial issues still persist in the USA. I think its things like this that make an entry entitled Bikes are for Bitches (and Ladies) humorously acceptable whereas an entry called Knickknacks for Nigers would make a lot of people shriek in disgust, even if the club was created by a black person. But is it truly a doublestandard that we would allow one and not the other? If we allow one person to say bitch, even if its a feminist who said it, I believe everyone should be allowed to.

  Scott, I appreciate your response and it does help me understand a different view of the doublestandard.  The bitch Nword example misses a bit.  I would never use the word bitch to refer to a woman and dont appreciate others who do, but it isnt threatening the way that cunt and fuck are.  The increased power of women in the professions and in education didnt occur to me as a factor in changing the public reaction to gender slurs. I dont think it should change the public reaction to threatening violent words.  For context, I retired nearly 20 years ago from programming and always felt privileged to have work that was so much fun for for which I felt more than fairly paid.  I did experience minor rude treatment by engineering classmates at Cornell in the 50s. The engineering schools put up obstacles to dissuade me from taking electives, but nothing that turned out to be of any consequence.
      I also appreciate your perspective and the wellintentioned spirit behind your posts. Your thoughts have caused me to question my own viewpoints and some of the assumptions I have previously made. SM

20110329 22:06:52 nbsp All of the folks involved in this discourse have done a really good job of laying out both sides.  I dont have anything to add, just thought Id chime in with a well put for everyone involved. Users/TomGarberson

20110520 09:44:35 nbsp Edit and the Comment bar both work just fine.  You can also add information right into the main text of the pagethats what its there for, after all!  Sounds like a fun sighting.  My wife and I saw what I think were two Sand Hill Cranes at West Area Pond a week or two ago... doesnt seem too common in town. Users/TomGarberson

20110803 14:58:04 nbsp Ha!  Mystery solved.  Wow... I would have just walked up and peeked in the box.  Not out of stupidity; I would have left alone random boxes in London when the IRA was doing their thing.  But Im pretty comfortable that a shoebox in a plastic bag in a stairwell in Davis is statistically likely to be just lost and found, not a bomb... to the point that poking into them on a regular basis is probably safer than a decade of riding a bike in a bike lane.  While wearing a helmet.  Although youll probably find kitty litter or an old lunch at some point if you looked into enough randomly discarded bags. Users/JabberWokky

20111015 17:31:39 nbsp Thanks! There is another older article by the same guy that talks about neoliberalism, highly recommended if you enjoyed the other rolling stones one I posted. Users/ConsciousConsumer

20120723 13:58:45 nbsp Thanks for adding that NYT article.  Fun read. Users/TomGarberson

20130621 09:24:18 nbsp Thanks for the comment.  Some of the pilots at Yolo have been working to improve relations with our nonaviation neighbors.  If youd like to come over to the airport and look around and maybe take an airplane ride give me a call at JK microsystems. Users/JimStewart
