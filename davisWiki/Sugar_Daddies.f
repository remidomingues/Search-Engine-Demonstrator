Sugar Daddies is arriving businesses now open at the location formerly occupied by Yogurt Shack.  It is a sort of dessert food court, consisting of two businesses (Davis Creamery and Cupcake Craving), one selling ice cream and the other selling cupcakes and Cookies, Pastries, and Baked Goods cookies.  The two companies often merge their products with desserts like ice cream sandwiches and brownie ice cream combos. It is the reincarnation of the Davis Creamery in Oakshade Town Center, which also sold all three of these items. The name Sugar Daddies is a catchy play on words resulting from the two owners being fathers.

Cupcakes are $2.50 a pop; ice cream is $2.95 for a small, $4.50 for a regular, and $4.95 for a sundae. They also have shakes and malts, house made cookies, cowpies (your choice of ice cream with your choice of two cookies), and the infamous cow kiss (hot brownie with two scoops of salted caramel on top). They also have milk and coke products available.

On Sundays they have Sunday Gourmet ice creams available, which feature their higherend and quirkier flavors like Maple Bacon, Honey Lavender (with local lavender pollen), Green Tea, Honey Goat Cheese and Fig Swirl, etc.  Their ice cream is cows Udderly Delicious.

20110615 12:39:17 nbsp Im thrilled to have this place downtown, and even more thrilled that their real blueberry ice cream is as good as ever.  If you like blueberries at all, you will love this ice cream  it is so rich and flavorful.  The real strawberry ice cream is very good too, just not as unusual as the blueberry, of course!  A quick trip to Thai Canteen followed by some Davis Creamery ice cream makes for a lovely, dogfriendly evening outdoors. Users/CovertProfessor


20110703 14:35:55 nbsp We dropped by this place after lunch today.  Very nice!  I had a scoop of the avocado coconut ice cream and it was excellent.  Incredibly rich and creamy.  Theyll happily give you samples of the ice cream, so if you think it sounds weird, give it a tryyoull be pleasantly surprised.

My wife got a raspberryfilled chocolate cupcake with fudge frosting and it was quite good as well.  I dont know if they sell milk there, but they really should  a big, cold glass of milk is a must with cupcakes this rich.  Weve got a German chocolate cupcake in the fridge for later.

20110713 15:29:45 nbsp Sugar Daddies? Needs a catchy, attentiongrabbing apostrophe instead perhaps: Sugar Daddys.
Just throwing in my marketing (two) sense. Users/RaoulDuke

20110716 18:05:49 nbsp may its Daddies plural b/c its 3 businesses in one? Users/jsbmeb

20110817 08:42:14 nbsp Suggestion: Can you start a twitter account or something that lists what flavors you have that day? I feel I would come a lot more if I knew what you were going to have....

Also, is dollar(or $1.50 now) scoop night gone? Users/elliottPollard

20110830 17:11:55 nbsp This place is great! Friendly service and delicious offerings! Users/ashleyinthemist

20110905 22:10:43 nbsp I just went here for a cupcake and it was delicious! I got the chocolate cupcake with a cheesecake center and cheesecake topping and it was great. I will have to go back for some ice cream next time. I tried a sample of the Nutella ice cream which was absolutely awesome, not too rich  perfect flavor. The only complaint I had was that they just handed the cupcake to me on a napkin. Most cupcake places I am used to give you a box and a fork.  Users/OliviaHenry

20110907 22:56:50 nbsp Really happy to see that Davis Creamery is back, though I have mixed feelings about the introduction of cupcakes adorable cupcakes all lined up nice and pretty arent exactly conducive to a healthy diet. Ive only ever had the Champagne cupcake (which was delicious, by the way), but my boyfriend absolutely LOVES the orange creamsicle shake. Reasonable prices, really tasty desserts, topped off with friendly service. Really hope these guys are in it for the long haul. Users/AbbYu

20110930 11:48:03 nbsp Despite the large number of diabetics and lowcarb dieters in the world, very few bakeries offer lowcarb items. Nevertheless, I always ask when I pass a new bakery. I was surprised to find that Sugar Daddies has a whole section of sugarfree cupcakes. When they told me that they used maltitol as a sweetener I was slightly disappointed because maltitol is the least desireable of the sugar alcohols. It has a relatively high glycemic index and causes intestinal distress in some people. When I pointed this out, they were concerned and promised to look into substituting another sweetener. I could not ask for more. Users/MikeRubin

20111110 16:23:30 nbsp I loved this place when it was the Davis Creamery and I love it now as Sugar Daddies (though I did prefer the previous location to the new one).  I havent tried their ice cream, but I have had their cookies and cupcakes. Actually I discovered this place when I was searching for Cupcake Craving locations after a friend bought me one for my birthday one year.  Trust me, the cupcakes are AWESOME. The best Ive ever had. Im especially fond of Lemon Burst, Smores, and the cheesecake ones.  You will not be disappointed.  As for their cookies, they were very good as well, though not as amazing as the cupcakes.  Im not sure if they still do it, but they used to sell their dayold leftover cookies in a bag at a discounted price. They would throw about a dozen random kinds in the bag and mark the contents on the outside. Having such variety at a discounted price was really great, especially when your family has very different tastes!  Anyway, this place is great, definitely give it a shot, you will want to stop there on your way home from work or class every day! Users/IndigoShell

20111217 14:39:03 nbsp The name Sugar Daddies was created by the shops owners who felt it was a perfect fit since they are both Dads :) Users/meganvisciglia

20120219 21:16:01 nbsp This is probably the best ice cream in town. The flavor and texture are unsurpassed by anything else in Davis. Users/eganio

20120524 20:44:18 nbsp Excellent ice cream as usual.  However caveat emptor!  They are charging an illegal credit card use fee disguised as a $.25 total cash discount.  This is against both the policies of VIsa and California Civil Code Section 1748.1.  Lets hope they change their policy and come into compliance.  Excellent ice cream, by the way...... Users/DaveyBalaban
  Discounts for cash are legal; fees for credit cards are not.  It may not make much sense, but that is the law.  See Credit Card Minimum Purchase.   Users/CovertProfessor

20120525 01:11:40 nbsp I have been coming here every week for $1 scoop night. I love this place, the ice cream is always good, and the workers recognize me and the group of friends I come with!

White Chocolate Mocha and Orange Mango Sorbet are my favorites. I also like the seasonal ones like Irish Cream as well.  Users/chandru

20120607 19:57:59 nbsp Delicious and refreshing ice cream with interesting and always pleasing flavors. Irish Cream, Mexican Chocolate, Salted Caramel, LemonBasil, Nutella, and their awesome one with avocado are all great flavors. Raspberry sorbet is always perfect and not overly sweet. Orange Mango isnt my favorite, though its not a bad flavor. I just personally dont find it super appealing. The workers are all very kind and friendly, and will happily give you a sample so that you can see what you like. Ive been trying to come here every week for $1 scoop night with my friends, though I didnt get to go last week due to large amounts of work, and were always recognized when we come in. Friendly people who make awesome ice cream, recognize you, and talk with you when you come in? I think yes.

Their ice cream shakes are really good, and always have a pleasingly thick consistency, though its not so thick that pulling the stuff through the straw is a chore. Sometimes I get those instead of $1 scoops.

Cupcakes are always nice and fluffy, and Ive never had a problem with the frosting being overly sweet or the bread of the cupcake being dry/stale. They are delicious. I recommend you purchase one. Users/AlexTK

20120626 13:44:46 nbsp Best ice cream in town, but the customer service is terrible. Ive been flat out ignored and only begrudgingly served every time I come here, after waiting at the cash register until the line backs up. Also, on one dollar scoop night my boyfriend ordered two scoops, but they gave him a one scoop cup and when two scoops wouldnt fit the girl working there spooned the rest back into the carton and gave him two half scoops worth.

Bleh. Users/sundeimasu

20120626 14:08:50 nbsp Keep an eye out for their peach sorbet. That stuff is amazing. Users/LizPhillips

20120710 14:25:32 nbsp The Monkey Mania shake is amazing. Users/jsogul

20130104 18:23:15 nbsp The ice cream is fabulous but I find the cupcakes to be consistently a bit too dry and a bit too sweet. Let Them Eat Cake is better for cupcakes.  Users/PhoebeAyers
