20091222 11:24:29 nbsp Hey, you spammed the wiki!  Dont do that!  Even if its a great cause (you know, because next somebody spams all over the place to help adopt their kittens, and then somebody posts three hundred notices about a peace rally, and then somebody kicks out 1,300 notices about a fundraiser for their mothers cancer treatment).  Its a good cause, but doing the equivalent of spraypainting all the benches in local parks and gardens isnt the way to promote your cause.  There are several entries on the wiki that cover suicide, mental health and medical support, and it would be great if you could help contribute to them.  Posting all over unrelated entries isnt a great way to get the word out... and a volunteer has to come along and help wash off all the paint off the community garden that is the wiki.  By the way, http://www.snopes.com/holidays/christmas/suicide.asp it is a myth that suicides increase during holidays. They actually http://blogs.wsj.com/numbersguy/dosuicidesreallypeakduringtheholidays239/ peak in the spring.  Dont worry about having the notices get removed  there are plenty of volunteer editors on the wiki who can help you get your word out.  Whats your primary message?  Oh, and (although your first use of it was accidentally a bit over the top), welcome to the wiki.  (And you might want to read the link Jason gives you above about using your RealName... its hard to empathize and connect to other people when they invoke an industrial strength institutional title rather than Anita or Jeff).
