Suite E (pronounced Sweety) is your local shop for intimates and statements. Opened as a dress library in a tiny shop in August, 2010, Suite E has expanded into a much bigger location downtown. Starting February, 2011, Suite E brings lingerie to the residents of Davis, CA for the first time in over 40 years!! Suite E offers unique, oneofakind dresses for purchase OR for rent that are not only trendy and topshelf, but also comfortable and reasonably priced. We also accept consignment dresses and offer a competitive 50/50 split on revenue earned from any dress. You can always view the most glamorous hidden gems from Davis closets on the front rack near the locally made jewelry :)

Suite E carries lingerie from designers such as Cosabella, La Perla, Chantelle, Betsey Johnson, Hanky Panky and many more! Bras, panties, teddies, costumes, hosiery, and accessories. We are here to be your source for lingerie and dresses in town...so please, tell us what lingerie you would like to see in town.

We are proud to support local and hand made products and carry a variety of great goods for your pleasure. We are also interested in carrying more and would love to hear from you if you have a product that fits well with us. Currently we support and carry:
