20111027 09:29:25 nbsp Hi there, and Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner welcome to the wiki!  Please take a minute to read over that welcome pageits got a lot of useful information.  The page you created your business got renamed Davis Taxi Service, since it looks like thats the companys name.  I had some concerns about the content of the page.  Im confused about the pickup situation, and the address you listed looks like its an address for Toomey Field or something.  Finally, have you seen the Copyrights page?  That taxi picture looks like its for Smart Cab  do you have permission to put it on the wiki under a creative commons license? Users/TomGarberson

20111028 11:40:49 nbsp Hey, I deleted the Taxi Service page, as we already have a wiki:sacramento:Taxi Services page. I merged the info from the Taxi Service page into the wiki:sacramento:Kmm Cab Co page, where it belongs. Users/NicholasBarry
