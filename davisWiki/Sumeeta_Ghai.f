 Vice President Candidate Statement 

Hey there Aggies!

We are Ryan Wonders and Sumeeta Ghai and we want to be your next ASUCD President and Vice President! Ryan was elected to the ASUCD Senate in Winter 2013 and currently serves on the Unit Relocation Space Allocation Committee. He is a brother of Alpha Gamma Rho and also works as an Aggie Host Security Officer. Sumeeta is the External Director of Lobby Corps and works with offices in Sacramento to voice student concerns to legislators. Sumeeta served as a director on the 99th Picnic Day Board last year, and she is also currently a dancer on the Bollywood dance team, UC Davis Lashkara.

NOW wants to promote student interests all over our campus. We believe that ASUCD should be accessible to all students and be fiscally responsible.

INCREASE STUDENT WAGES
UC Davis has a large population of hardworking student employees who often struggle to make ends meet. As the largest employer of students in the city of Davis, we believe ASUCD should set the bar for student wages and benefits. If elected, we will work with administration and unit directors to ensure the students employed by ASUCD are compensated fairly.

IMPROVE BIKE INFRASTRUCTURE
Davis is one of the proudest bike communities in the world, but we believe that there is room for growth. We strongly support the expansion of bike infrastructure on campus through the use of innovative bike parking and diligent upkeep of bike paths. We will work with the city of Davis to ensure roads that see heavy bike usage at night like Anderson and Sycamore are better lit, so that students are safer.

BRING LIVE MUSIC TO CAMPUS
In past years the MU was a host for live music, and we want to bring that back. We will work with administration and the Entertainment Council to turn the Memorial Union back into the goto Friday night spot for food, drinks, and live performances by expanding outdoor lighting of the MU in the evenings and bringing late night dining options.

ADVOCATE FOR STUDENTS
As undergraduate students attending a UC campus, we have the collective ability to voice our concerns, and make impactful changes. It is our goal to strengthen the advocacy of ASUCD, provide resources needed, recruit more students to engage, and ultimately involve more students into advocacy, so we can mobilize for causes that we as students care about, such as affordable tuition and transparent decisionmaking to move our campus forward.

INTEGRATE AND UNITE OUR CAMPUS
Looking to the future of our campus, especially considering the 2020 Initiative, we are mindful there will be an increasing amount of students on campus. Therefore, itâ€™s crucial for us to maintain a positive, welcoming campus culture and ensure the proper resources, programs, and faculty are available for all students to access as we grow.
