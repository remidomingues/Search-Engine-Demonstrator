Name: Summer Song, aka Summy, Kitty, KitKat, SumSum, Alfred, and Twinny

I was one of the four marvelous residents of The Bakery.  The Bakery was the very best place in Davis, despite the occasional Mullberry squashing incident in the backyard.  I no longer live in Davis cause Ive graduated.  Now I live in Berkeley.  Berkeley needs a wiki!

I was an English major.  Books are cool.


I love my Users/LeonaScanlan wombmate and my wombmate loves me.

I have a Users/MiriamKaufman wombat.  Wombats are stinkybut in a good way.

I was the Treasurer of Agnostic and Atheist Student Association AGASA. Yay, atheists!

I Knitting knit.  My Users/MariaMaria Panda likes to knit, too. Please dont ask us to knit you socks.

I love Pootleberry Dinglehopper Pootbut, then, who doesnt?

20050602 14:54:02 nbsp Hes not shorter than me though...thats just cause i was standing closer to the camera Users/MiriamKaufman

20050614 22:53:05 nbsp Yo, I thought Id comment on your page instead of the I Love Davis page. The Wooz was this little like theme park in Vacaville. It had this awful maze, but also gokarts and maybe an arcade... I was really young so I dont remember, but someone else might know. Basically it was one of the few fun thing in Vacaville to do and it got torn down. Sort of like The Nut Tree with its train and candy shop, just a nice fun familyfriendly place to go on the weekends. Users/MichelleAccurso

20050614 22:58:25 nbsp I have a journal of such things as well. A big 8x10 black book that I got at a bookstore for 4$ and it has 300+ pages... Oh, how some people dont know how to appreciate the greatest joys in life.... empty hard bound books. Users/MichaelGiardina

20050615 22:36:17 nbsp EH? Is that like a shaved cat? lol. How did we somehow bring porn into a discussion of puss... oh, I get it. Users/MichaelGiardina

20050617 18:04:26 nbsp Do you know there is a song called Summer Song ???  By Blue County.  Check it out.   Users/GeorgeLewis

20050627 14:05:12 nbsp Good Afternoon! Youre probably at work so youll get this in the next couple hours. Just dropping by and saying hello. Also, those cookies were excellent in vanilla ice cream. I think they were more round chocolatechip brownies than cookies, but they were still good. Users/MichelleAccurso

20050627 14:22:55 nbsp Ha ha, five minutes, nice. Cool I will stop by sometime, well bake and bake. Woohoo. Users/MichelleAccurso

20050628 13:50:11 nbsp Summer sure seems to know a lot about Davis Users/MiriamKaufman

20050628 13:50:49 nbsp :P Users/SummerSong

20050628 16:59:20 nbsp What a wonderful 500th edit you just made.  Users/MiriamKaufman

20050701 00:01:56 nbsp Hola! I just added some info to the privet page and realized that the berry pics you posted arent privet berries! Take a look around and see if those berries might be from a different tree. For some reason, Im thinking they could be ollalie berries. Privet berries are dark, ovoid, and hard... just a single drupe instead of a berry cluster like in your pic. Sorry about that! The other two pics are def privet, though. Users/AlphaDog

20050701 00:08:40 nbsp Ooh! Maybe theyre unripe mulberries... mulberries grow on trees versus vines, so its possible theres a mulberry tree right next to the privet. Users/AlphaDog

20050713 13:04:39 nbsp Braveheart! I have to admit that I take chances eating stuff I probably shouldnt.  ; )   Maybe you could ask your neighbor to prune their trees so they dont drop squishies in your yard... either that or ask your landlord. Squishies... reminds me of Eraserhead. Users/AlphaDog

20050713 15:11:45 nbsp I would put your question from the Featured Page featured page to either Users/PhilipNeustrom Phils profile, or the Donate page. Or on Users/ArlenAbraham Arlens page, just to bug him. Users/MichelleAccurso

20050718 16:59:49 nbsp Pootleberry Dinglehopper pootie would have liked you to bring her home a mouse Users/MiriamKaufman

20050729 17:45:53 nbsp thank you for being the first to welcome me to wiki I feel the love already. Users/MelanieMadden

20050801 12:47:54 nbsp Happy Birthday Summer Bummer Wummer!!!!!!!!!!!! Users/MiriamKaufman

20050915 19:03:15 nbsp OMG, I so need a ghettojito and I honestly havent had time to have any kindojito this summer. Once school starts though....  ; ) Users/AlphaDog

20051021 23:29:22 nbsp Nah, I dont think Ill make a Mount Rushmore for the club officers  that one was for ridiculing IDists... I could do a different image, perhaps roman columns with philospher statues and our heads on them? Users/KarlMogel

20051110 09:10:55 nbsp Morning Ms Summer! Ive been a bit slow this year... perhaps it is simply a matter of insufficient alcohol! I did get to toss a few mojitos this summer but never got around to the Ghettojito before the weather turned all cold and miserable. I much prefer Summer!!  ; D   With the hollydays approaching, any suggestions on what we should be drinking during the cold months? Mulled wine is always kinda nice and easy to make in the microwave... or maybe warm screwdrivers theres a dirty joke in there somewhere!. Users/AlphaDog

20051129 17:26:18 nbsp Hey! Where do you find all these strange fruits?? Heh, Billie Holiday just came to mind, though that prob belongs on Race & Ethnicity Anyway, looks like Edwin answered your question way before I ever even saw it! Users/AlphaDog
