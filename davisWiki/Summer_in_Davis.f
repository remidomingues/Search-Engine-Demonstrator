   Shorter lines at a lot of places
   The rec pool isnt as busy
   Driving in Davis Traffic is pretty light, so biking is less dangerous.
   Its freaking HOT, which means you can wear shorts until midnight and barbecue at least until then!!
   The pace slows down to one where you can chat with all the people whose names you dont know but that you see all the time. Everybody gets a bit friendlier, neighbors invite you over for a cold one because its so damn hot, and were not nearly as surly as we are when 5th Street is clogged with boys in rice rockets!
   If youre a Graduate Students grad student, its a great chance to get work done.

   If youre a Graduate Students grad student, most likely you still have to work.
   Turtle House/Name Debate Wiki drama kicks up.

Pros or Cons, depending on how you look at them

Tips for Surviving the Oppressive Heat
For a few days each summer, Davis is over 100 degrees F. Average high temperature in July is 93, in August is 92. Average low, thanks to the Delta Breeze, is 58 degrees F both months. There are lots of days where the high temperature is only in the 80s, and some where it is in the 100s. People tend to remember the latter and forget the former. Humidity on a hot day is usually less than 25%, often much lower. Every so often, typically in early to midJuly, we experience a period of several days over 100 degrees. It is also common for us to experience periods of several days in the upper 80s. People tend to overstate the heat here, especially if they moved here from a cool coastal climate.

The occasional bouts of hot weather combined with the empty town can be troublesome for longterm residents and students alike.

Find, use, and abuse as much free air conditioning as you possibly can.  Get wet in a local Swimming swimming pool.  Drink lots of cold water and eat ice cream for every meal (but dont forget to eat fruits and vegetables too).



Summerproof Your Windows
A MUST to survive:  Mess with the windows! I live at Anderson Place Apartments Anderson Place in a room thats roughly 9x10.  I have a window that is 3x7.  My apartment faces west, and there is no tree in front of my window. My room is a freaking oven. Against apartment policy to install stuff on the inside or outside.   Go buy shadecloth at the local hardware store, nursery, or http://www.homedepot.com Home Depot.  Im using two layers. One between the blinds and the window itself, and another on the outside of the blinds.  Dont get black shadecloth!!! Get the tan, or smoke blue. Helps reflect the light. It really does help keep the room cooler if you close the blinds and have that double layer. Usually my room becomes 400 degrees by  4 pm.  Now its delayed til about 6.

IceWater Humidifier
Fill a humidifier (or vaporizer) with ice water and enjoy the cool mist.  Note that this wont do much damage to the heat in a large room, and its best if you are close enough that the mist falls on you.

Fan Chain
Also: A Fan chain. Really inefficient, but we only have 1 ac in the living room that doesnt reach into the hooked hallway towards the bedrooms.  We end up turning it on high, and using 4 or 5 fans. One in living room to fan cool air into hallway, one in hallway to push it down, one in front of each bedroom doorway.  It helps, but its probably a ridiculous waste of power. But when it reaches those hot temperatures, anything helps.

Apartment Hunting: Choose Wisely
Best tip is think of the summer before you pick your apartment. And preferably get a lower level.  Dont think Oh this one is closest to the bus stop, so convenient THINK OF THE SUMMER SUN! AHhahahah hhurgh.

Bicycle Air Conditioning
Ride your bike. Exercising may seem counterintuitive, but if you can stick to mainly flat, shady streets, the airflow over the skin helps a lot. Dampening your shirt beforehand helps even more. Or just buy a fan.

Schedule Your Day Around the Sun
Starting very early in the morning, open all your doors. This will allow cool morning air in. Bugs dont fly about much in the morning, so this is a good time to do this. By about 8 to 8:30 or so, youll want to close your door. At this point, keep all the doors closed, windows closed, blinds down. This will trap the cool air (unless you live in one of those poorly designed apartments with just one window at each end and no crossventilation. Then youre outta luck and its A/C time). About 7:30 to 8 p.m., when the suns gone down or just about to set, try to check the temperature inside as compared with outside. Once the inside temperature is equal or less than outside, raise your shades, blinds, whatever, and open the windows. This will allow cool(er) air to circulate.

Cool Shower before Sleeping
Right before you go to bed, take a cool shower. This will help, especially if you have the privacy and can sleep in the buff. Your body will feel somewhat cooler and itll be easier to get comfortable and try to sleep.

Kiddie Pool!!
Get a kiddie pool and while its filling with water, get a cooler of drink and your phone or a good mag, then park your butt for the afternoon. Now head over to the hammock and air dry, then repeat. Summers way more fun without air conditioning!

Homebrew A/C
Build a http://www.eng.uwaterloo.ca/~gmilburn/ac/ Homebrew Air Conditioning System.

Dont Waste the Cool Times of Day
Dont sleep in. On broiling hot days, mornings and evenings (after the sun goes down, anyways) tend to be very pleasant. Do as much as possible before about 10:00AM or after about 7:00PM, and then as little as possible during the middle of the day.

Exercise at Cooler Hours, in Shady Places
You can still walk, jog or run.  Just do so in the morning before 8 a.m. or 9 a.m.depending on the predicted temperature for the dayin a shaded area.  My favorite spot is the treelined path along Russell Boulevard, aka the Avenue of Trees, just west of Highway 113. (Or buy an ARC membership during the summer if you are not enrolled at UC Davis during the summer.)

Freeze Your Clothes
You can freeze a tshirt nicely in the freezer and then put it on for a rush of cold.  Works well if the shirt isnt too wet, just a bit.

Drink Cold Fluids
Chill some water bottles and take them with you when you go out, and remember to refill and replace them in the refrigerator when they are empty. If you are really hot and you need to cool off fast, try drinking liquids that contain sugar and other dissolved solutes, such as Lemonade. The sugar lowers the freezing point of the drink so when you add ice, the Lemonade, for example, actually gets colder than plain ice water ever can. It should cool you off faster.

Sleeping Cooler
Use a wet towel as your blanket. The water will evaporate and it will cool you down. The cool towel makes a huge difference.

Daytime Wet Tower
You can also use a wet towel during the day. Wet a towel and wrap yourself with it. The cooling effect is actually quite decent if you are stuck without air conditioning.

Summer Session Classes are AirConditioned
If youre taking Summer Sessions, have your classes in the afternoon and early evening.  You sit and learn in a nice, cool, airconditioned classroom.

20060330 19:42:28 nbsp Summer in davis is surviveable, just annoying.  Strategically placed fans in your dwelling can fix the problem of expensive AC.  Oh, and leaving windows open during the night can help keep the house cool during the day.  It might also help that my entire house is tiled.  It keeps things nice and cold.  Users/JulienBiewerElstob

20060603 20:39:54 nbsp Go see movies midafternoon during the hottest time of the day.  Its cheaper anyway. Bring a sweater or long sleeve shirt because the theater is feels very cold.  Save precious cooler evening hours for outdoor activities.

Try to wear as little as possible and as loose as possible.  Buy comfortable sunglasses and wearing a hat can prevent headaches from squinting.  Get used to carrying a water bottle and keep it filled.   Users/SharlaDaly

20060627 13:35:56 nbsp Is it just me or are Summer Sessions freakishly more busy than in previous years? This is my third summer session at Davis and Ive never seen so many freaking people! I used to like it more because I felt like I owned campus. SS

20060628 02:03:28 nbsp I love taking classes in summer session. The classes are nice and small, the campus is nice and empty and quiet. Im active during the normal school year and am a social person, but its really quite a relief in the summers. I always feel a little claustrophobic when campus explodes in the fall Users/AlvinTsao

20060725 16:34:19 nbsp Given the power situation in California right now, I recommend that people try to reduce the usage of AC during peak hours. A lot of California is experiencing this extraordinary heat right now, and there could be rolling blackouts. Run your AC at night or early morning to cool it off, and close your blinds to keep heat from getting in  that should help keep the temperature down while reducing strain on energy supplies.
