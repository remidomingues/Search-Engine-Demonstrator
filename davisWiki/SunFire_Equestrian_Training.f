20120313 21:11:44 nbsp Ive been training with SunFire for 5 years now, and Ive loved every minute of it. The people and horses are all great, and Alana is a superb trainer from beginning to advanced riding levels. I was fairly certain I didnt even want to do eventing when I started out, but now I think its the best thing in the world! Alana is such a great person and trainer, and opens up so many options for all levels, and you can tell she loves the horses, her students, and what she does. The atmosphere is so great it has become my place to go to get away from everyday stress and drama; A home away from home! Users/BeccaS

20120318 19:49:02 nbsp Alana is truly my ideal trainer. She has a uncannily perceptive eye, a very solution oriented approach to training and is kind and encouraging to both horse and rider. I have been riding with Sunfire for a little over a year and my riding, confidence and eye have improved greatly in that time. Alana also connected me with the horse of my dreams for which I will be forever grateful! Highly recommend Sunfire.  Users/MarikoP

20120319 11:07:39 nbsp I found Alana after a few years off from riding and wanting to take up a new discipline. She is amazing! I have learned a great deal in a short time and always look forward to my lessons with her. They are always challenging and fun and I always feel like a better rider afterwards. The horses at SunFire are just as great and Alana is the perfect horse/rider match maker! SunFire is my favorite place to spend my free time and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in improving their riding skills and having fun :)  Users/ehummer
