Just a start here

Davis is hot and sunny from May to September, so sun protection is important.  Here are some ways to protect yourself from those UV rays.

Sunscreen

SPF (Sun Protection Factor) is A number on a scale for rating sunscreens. The SPF numbers on a package can range from as low as 2 to as high as 60. These numbers refer to the products ability to block out the suns rays.

The SPF rating is calculated by comparing the amount of time needed to produce a sunburn on protected skin to the amount of time needed to cause a sunburn on unprotected skin.

An SPF of 15 or higher is generally considered helpful in protecting the skin from UV rays.

recommendations:
  I like Coppertone Sport Ultra Sweatproof/Waterproof  it sprays on and drys instantly.  Complete coverage without getting your hands full of lotion. Also, the baby faces stick with 50+ SPF is great.  Users/JanelleAlvstadMattson Janelle

Hats

Broad brimmed hats are especially useful, keeping the sun off both your face and your neck.

Clothing

Most clothing has some sun protection factor, but you can also purchase clothing specifically made to have 30+ SPF.

Sunglasses

If you already have glasses, you can get prescription sunglasses or those interestinglooking temporary sunglasses (which look normal inside, but get darker in direct sunlight).
