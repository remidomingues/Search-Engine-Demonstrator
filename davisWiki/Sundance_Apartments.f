Sundance is one of the many apartments in Davis, but one of the few which is located across the street from UC Davis. It is directly across Russell Boulevard from West Village. The complex is managed by Tandem Properties who are very prompt in addressing issues/complaints.

Residents have commented that they like the bus stop across the street, proximity to UC Davis, new central heat and air, and the clean pool, large spa and saunas.  Others have commented that noise sensitive people should look elsewhere as there are known to be late nights, loud neighbors and thin walls.

20060428 14:31:54 nbsp Is there really a sauna here?  Users/ChuckFrank

20060606 10:39:27 nbsp Yes, there are two saunas  they are fairly small and only hold up to three people.  Users/EmmyMelton

20070513 14:58:48 nbsp I lived here for one summer a few years ago. It was ok and kind of closer to school than most places, but I have to admit that the a/c was totally old and expensive. It was not good at all, so I didnt bother turning it on. Summer in Davis with no a/c? What was I thinking??? The walls are paper thin. You hear people walking over your head all the time. Hopefully, they fixed the a/c by now. Users/Jedron

20070606 16:03:11 nbsp actually, the management has installed new central heating into the apartments that work really well to cool or heat the apartment. theyve done a lot of renovations to the complex throughout the school year, which was somewhat of an annoyance. Users/JasminCamacho

20080719 16:23:01 nbsp Does anyone know if this apartment complex allows dogs? Users/kferguson

20091108 11:23:42 nbsp This place is the worst Ive been.  Noisy and disrespectful neighbors. Sounds like the ceiling is collapsing, dry rot visible in main support beams. No pets allowed. No covered parking, every tree drops fruits or seeds to rot on your car.  Parties allowed in office, usually go past allotted time and have routy people who will pee on you property such as your bike and door handles.  Overall bad place to live. Users/scruza

           2010322 11:16:37 nbsp In response to this post, there is covered parking available for $15/month, and parties are NOT allowed   in the office/clubhouse.  The clubhouse is available for residents to rent out and the residents that used it and had a party were in violation of the clubhouse rules/policy.

20091108 23:06:50 nbsp this is the WORST apartment complex i ever lived in my entire life as a student in davis. when i lived there last year, the walls were extremely thin. you could here ppl walking up the stairs, alarm clocks, music playing from your neighbors place, anything and EVERYTHING. im talking PAPER THIN. do not i repeat do NOT use their dsl. its the slowest thing i ever used in my life and i even had to switch to comcast because i couldnt deal with my internet going in and out when i had to turn in hw the next day. the refrigerator is pretty old looking and the oven doesnt even have a timer for baking. also, the apartments do not come with a microwave. oh! and another thing that drove me nuts was when my neighbors would shut the door really loud, it sounded like someone was trying to open your door because you can hear it so clearly. i would never live there again and im glad im out of that hell hole. worst place ever. dont live here. only plus is that the bus stop is right in front of the apartment complex. but not worth it to live in. youll be miserable if you choose this place. Users/cristinad

20100318 13:47:32 nbsp Just as a counterpoint to those above, I thought Id comment—its a pretty decent place to live, I thought. The heating and A/C works well and is energyefficient (so you can use it all the time in summer), and the insulation in the walls is good as well, so you dont need it that much; when it was 105 last summer, it was 79 in here with the A/C off. The ceilings can be noisy if youre on the ground floor, though; my upstairs neighbors are quiet most of the time but scamper around a lot occasionally... not a huge deal, unless you get crazy ones. Their free Omsoft DSL is indeed slow; its 1.5 megabit, which means it tops out around 150k a second for downloads. But, its free, so. Never had it go in and out in two years, though, and thats with lots of WoW and BitTorrent uptime verification. Appliances were new when I moved in (there is no microwave included, though). I cant comment on dry rot in the main support beams, since they arent actually visible, and I neglected to bring my Xray specs. Covered parking is indeed available, although with a caveat: regular parking is free, but reserved, covered spaces are $15/mo. The adjacent Davis Small Animal Hospital did fling dog poo out their window one time though, hitting a couple cars parked at Sundance. The other problems seem to be with shitty neighbors, so I cant really comment there. Id say there were about five huge parties in the pool area in all of 2009, give or take a couple. Annoying as hell at the time, but eh... I expected worse, since most people are noisy idiots and this is a college city. At least the management keeps it clean; theres an old guy whos out cleaning the pool area whenever Im biking to class at 9ish. Theyre pretty quick with maintenance, as well; I made an online request at 10AM when my water was being weird, and when I got back from class at 1, it was fixed.

So the price is a little high. One nonmadeup problem Ive had is that the window frames seem to have been crappily installed, and the paint around them is a little suspect; not really an issue in practice. The laundry room is a genuine annoyance here, though; $1.25 to wash, $1.00 to dry, but the washers are tiny and the dryers dont do an awesome job, so a week of clothes/gym clothes/towels usually ends up taking like $5 in quarters to properly wash and dry, which sucks. I also dont like their Friday afternoon landscaping thing—I guess thats the best time to be using leaf blowers, but when I still have studying to do, its a pain in the ass. So yeah, if it was $900/mo for a 1br, the free DSL was 3 or 6mb, using a freezeray on your neighbors was nonfictitious and legal, and the laundry room was awesome or free, Sundance would be fantastic, but as it is, its pretty good.

Just as addenda, since this page doesnt really address it: They redid the pool area, now theres just the pool and a big hottub.  Only caged pets are allowed (bah!) I think theyre open on Saturdays as well. I dunno what the Study Area in the Amenities section refers to, but unless they mean the main communityish building, Im pretty sure that doesnt really exist.

20140622 23:41:06 nbsp Lived here for a year. Overall a pretty decent place with huge rooms. WARNING: There are spiders on spiders in these complexes so if youre planning to live here, be prepared to love living with them or become a pro spider annihilator. Users/mcs
