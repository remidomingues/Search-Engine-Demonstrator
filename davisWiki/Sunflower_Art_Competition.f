The http://www.namisunflowers.org/artmain.html Sunflower Art Competition is an annual event sponsored by NamiYolo, a grassroots mental health advocacy organization that offers education, advocacy and support to people living with mental illness and their families.   The competition is to choose the design for the “Seeds of Hope” sunflower seed packets which are sold throughout the year as part of NAMIYolos Tallest Sunflower in Yolo County Contest.

The Sunflower Art Competition is open to artists of all ages.  Entry deadline is the last Friday in May. A reception and awards takes place the second Saturday of June.  The Davis Art Center hosts the exhibition the first three weeks of June.  See http://www.namisunflowers.org/artmain.html Sunflower Art Competition for latest details.
