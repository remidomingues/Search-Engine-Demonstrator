Sunflowers can be found in both Town Flora personal gardens and farmers fields Outskirts just outside of town. They are grown locally for seed production. The seeds harvested will be planted throughout the world for confection, oil, or ornamental markets.  Sunflower seeds are one of Yolo Countys  top grossing agricultural commodities with over $11,000,000 worth of seeds harvested in 2010.
Two varieties are planted for crosspollination, and European honeybees are used to supplement the native bees that pollinate the flowers.
