Um, Im just me I suppose.  I go by the name of Sunny, so its probable that people know me this way.  Anyhow.  Not too much that I can say about myself without feeling like Im being vain.  Though Ive been known to ramble, I try not to only so that I dont scare people away.  But if you allow, I can sure talk anyones ear off.  Its been known to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1906_San_Francisco_earthquake happen.  Thankfully, Ive also been known to lend mine to others on many occasions.  Ive also been known to wander downtown since I work downtown.  Youll probably see me if you ever stop by The Avid Reader.  I decided to write something about myself in the hopes that someone might read it and thereby making me feel more a part of this wonderful Davis city.  Probably not though.  If you ever see me walking down the street, wave to me and Ill wave back.  If you come up to talk to me, I probably wont run away screaming like a http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?termadult+little+girl little girl.  No promises though.

EDIT: This was my old info. I left it up because it was part of the Davis me. Now I live in Sacramento and have not had time to do much for this website since I dont visit as often as Id like to. I might update again, when the fancy occurs.

Current employment: A student of life, again

Current location: Exploring his new home of Sacramento

Currently reading:
School text books

Currently excited about: Working his schedule around so he can make it to the gym regularly. And the new fun that he is to be having.

Currently craving for: A good nights sleep...

New Favorite Website: http://www.goodreads.com Good Reads is an awesome website for organizing your books and book habits.



I figure maybe Ill do something with this profile thing once I know what People others do with theirs.  Who knows...

Below are a flurry of pictures of me because I dont know quite how to integrate them into this profile thing.  But hey, it took me 5 minutes to figure out how to even get them up, so maybe itll take me another 5 minutes to figure that part out.  But if it doesnt, Im free to take advice.  Otherwise, Im still around downtown wondering how the hell this thing works and why IE7 is taking up so much of my resources.  If you ever figure it out, you might catch me downtown.  Usually at the Village Bakery eating their awesome pizza or getting some yummy Sizzling Rice Soup from Silver Dragon.







Howdy!  Rather than just complaining about a lack of some authors living in Davis on the Noteworthy Published Authors list, why not just add them?  The entire list was created by people just like you who knew a few more, added them, and in turn had more added by the next person who came along.  It sounds like you know some good local authors  go ahead and click edit and add them.  The wiki needs your contributions! Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

  20080316 14:50:58 nbsp I guess I will once I figure out how to edit these pages properly (for example, how to reply to your comment without me using the comments thing to create a new comment).  Ive mostly been commenting on stuff cause thats the easiest thing to do rather than editing pages.  I am computer savvy, but not yet wikisavvy.  However, your comment has motivated me to compile my Rolodex into a wikisuitable list.  Any recommendations on how to post it would be appreciated. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

  Sweet, I figured out how to edit it!

20080407 14:28:15 nbsp Hi there!  Yes!  Let us celebrate the joys of having ADHD (rather than being reminded about all the drawbacks)!!  Im so down with creating a page dedicated to it.  Davis is a college town and Im sure many students would provide commentary.  Perhaps we can have an online support group.  God knows I need it! Mahalo. Users/CurlyGirl26

20080407 18:55:01 nbsp ADHD eh? When were you diagnosed? What medications do you take if any? Users/StevenDaubert

20080407 18:56:44 nbsp You are so right, Sunny!  Lets do it!  This is something that is very personal and I would love to do this.  I was one of those people you speak of.  And even though I have access to healthcare and a support system, its STILL never easy.  Ive had my dark moments.  Imagine those who are on their own.   Users/CurlyGirl26

20080408 02:04:05 nbsp I would ramble for a long time, but Im going to get some sleep

20080408 14:42:52 nbsp We should come up with a catchy title for our page. Users/CurlyGirl26

20080409 15:38:32 nbsp You may have a point there.  However, in the beginning it might be helpful just to throw a title up and see what happens.  We can always move things around later.  One page would be dedicated to the old idea of having an ADHD page and then another page for the discussion.   An ADHD page would include resources (esp ones through UCD and ones in Davis. And we could link to them).  Also, a section for general discussion/questions.  Another idea is to include a list of all the positive things associated with ADHDsince so much of whats out there is focused on the disorder side of things.  And Im sure others will have other suggestions.   Users/CurlyGirl26

20080409 21:12:26 nbsp Awesome!  Thanks for getting the ball rolling.  I think we should go ahead and add things as they occur to us.  When you get a chance, can you add a Comments section?  That way we can get a discussion going.  Thanks again! Users/CurlyGirl26

20080704 13:03:04 nbsp 10,000 edits were on Davis Wiki.  Well... kind of.  Theres a bug for either high edit counts or older accounts where not all edits are counted (and sometimes your edit count actually goes backwards after you edit something!).  You can see the Davis Wiki stats at User Statistics.  Its a really silly metric, but its still fun in the odometer rolling over kind of way.  Personally, I think the numerical metrics that count far more is how many entries there are and how many people use the wiki (if youre gonna count, look at the project itself).  Of course, the most important thing is if the wiki is a useful and enjoyable resource for the community it is for, and that reflects on every editor, no matter how many or how few edits they have done. Users/JabberWokky

  Oh, I totally agree that its the quality, not the quantity.  And considering your posts being of superior quality, it speaks mountains.  I was just curious about where people go the 10,000 number.  Makes me wanna check my own stats now that I know how to check them. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

I meant to attend, but my roommate needed a ride from the airport Sunday night (his arrival time was 6:45 pm).  I guess I could have told him to get a ride from someone else, but then it would have been uncomfortable.  . .

My love for the military probably stems from the fact that I was inducted into a military family via my stepdad but had been practically raised by other military families growing up.  When you are a kid in DC it seemed that you either met the children of military officers or politicians.  Despite constantly moving around, family drama and hampered education options the military kids still seemed better adjusted.

20090916 20:38:19 nbsp In regard to your question to JabberWokky... there is no one answer to her question. The reason for that is that there is no central authority here, but the result of collaborative editing that is supposedly moderated by community discussion. Other people would be free to replace the page if she removed it. The deeper question is why she wouldnt want the page up. Is it because she perceives that the value of having the information up isnt worth the risk of someone leaving a negative comment? Users/JasonAller

20090916 20:58:02 nbsp If there are logos, rather than a picture of the business sign, those should probably be removed as to upload them would be to release them under CC licensing.  Users/JasonAller

20090916 23:04:13 nbsp She is correct that advertising the business is under her control.  The wiki does not advertise any business or political group (and is actually prohibited from doing so by bylaws, state laws and submitted federal documents).  It merely documents Davis.  As a side result, trademarks, including logos, are under fair use exemption.  The key thing that shes mistakenly thinking is that the wiki entry about her business is anything other than a documentary page about the subject of her business within the context of Davis.  It is an increasingly common misconception.  In the same way that she cannot prevent a newspaper from running an article about her business, the wiki is open to editors who wish to write about her Davis related business.  As for the comment section, I was against the proliferation of comment sections back in 2005, and I still see them as horribly overused and questionable to the long term health of the wiki.  That said, the community sure does like em. Users/JabberWokky

20090917 00:26:33 nbsp noticed your jabberwokky comment

20090920 16:18:47 nbsp Sunny, I wouldnt burn any more calories on this guy.  You cant reason with the unreasonable.  Its like trying to divide by zero.  Cant be done.   People with legitimate issues/concerns do not behave in this manner.  Weve all had negative experiences, and yet, we dont all go around making bogus allegations, bullying people and resorting to criminal threats.

Besides, if hes as unstable as he sounds, you might be putting yourself at risk.  Please dont. He could just as easily turn on you.  The best way to deal with a bully is to ignore him.  Failing that, report.  Harassing, criminal behavior should not be tolerated.   Users/CurlyGirl26
