Sunrise Assessment Services promotes itself as a collections agency for Homeowner Associations who are searching for assistance in collecting delinquent dues from their members.   Sunrise Assessment Services and its sister company, Foreclosure Link, are not collections agencies.  They are companies specializing in foreclosure and sale of the properties  a process that can take as little as 125 days from referral to the sale of the property, per their own websites.

Sunrise Assessment Services focuses on Home Owners Association related properties, while Foreclosure Link directs its services to solely owned homes.

Promoted as a nocost to the HOA way of collecting delinquent dues, Sunrise Assessment Services forces the homeowner to pay thousands of dollars in fees to resolve the delinquency and keep the home from being sold through nonjudicial foreclosure.  Fees range from $2.00 for a notice sent to the homeowner to $1000 to promote the sale of the property.

Sunrise Assessment does not allow the homeowner to make payments for the current dues owed but rather adds them to the total amount owed forcing the homeowner to fall further and further behind with fees and costs compounding.  This is in direct violation of CA Civil Code 1367.1(6)b) and CC&Rs for some Homeowner Associations.

Sunrise Assessment Services will allow a 9 month payment plan once the property has reached the point that it is ready to sell and the company has been able to charge the maximum amount for its services.  By this time, the repayment amount per month can be hefty and unsustainable for most lowincome condo owners in Davis.

Payments are applied to Sunrise Assessments fees before applying them to the delinquent dues owed to the HOA causing additional months of delinquent dues, late fees and interest due to the HOA to increase. This practice appears to be in violation of CA Civil Code 1367.1(6)b) and CC&Rs for some Homeowner Associations.

The homeowner can obtain and temporary injunction to stop the foreclosure or declare bankruptcy in extreme cases, but Sunrise will then collect its fees directly from the homeowners association.  If the homeowners association tries to intervene in the process, it is threatened with legal action and the collection of fees directly from the HOA.  Sunrise Assessment Services does not play well with others.

In addition, Sunrise Assessment Services does not immediately forward payments made to the HOA, per contract agreements, and it is necessary for the HOA to make repeated efforts to collect the money from Sunrise Assessment Services once they become aware of the payments by their members.

The only way to break free and protect ownership in the property is to pay the amount due in full.  The amount owed can be mind boggling with collection fees far exceeding the amount owed.  For example, one fixedincome homeowner in Davis, CA in 2008 paid nearly $8500 to resolve final delinquent dues of $3724 with this predatory company on the eve of the sale of his condo through nonjudicial foreclosure.

Sunrise Assessment Services was sued in Federal Court, CA Eastern District in May 2007 for abusive collection practices in violation of the Fair Debt Collection Act.
