Suntree Apartments is a Tandem Properties apartment complex with spacious duplexes and townhomes in a wellmanicured setting adjacent to the Covell Greenbelt.  Tenants have prime seats for the July 4th Fireworks.

Residents comment that this complex is a good value for the size and central location.  The units are older and surrounded by mature trees, so maintenance problems and insects may be more prevalent.  However, one resident noted that the repair team is quick to respond and there was an insect spraying in the beginning of the year that was offered.

20090610 09:22:00 nbsp The management here is very nice and helpful. I like the personal touch they have, and they really work with the residents. Teresa was especially professional and friendly. This seems like a great place to rent. Users/HonnaSteissberg HS

20100111 10:09:16 nbsp I am currently living here  this is my first year.  Yeah, the parking permits can be an issue because it is distributed to be one less than the bedroom number per apartment, but it is Winter Quarter 2010, none of my room mates have picked up their parking permits, and we actually have 4 cars for our 4 BR and we have never run into any trouble.  The parking policy here seems to be very understanding  probably accommodating to the complaints regarding it, but Ive only lived here for two quarters and I will update again at the end of the year.  Besides that, I love living here!  The management is very friendly and because of several miscommunications among my room mates and I, we were late for the rent check on several occasions, but Teresa was understanding and it wasnt until the third time that we were charged an extra $10, but that is completely expected.  There is no washer or dryer unit in the 4 BR, but we brought our own.  Also, yes the apartment complex is older, but the repair team is quick to respond and there was an insect spraying in the beginning of the year that was offered.  Overall, I like living here because it is only a 510 minute bike ride to campus if you cut through the park and Davis high school, also close Safeway, the gas station, freeway, etc., and a short drive to Nugget, Lil Ceasars, Subway, etc. Users/tuminator

20110328 17:43:36 nbsp I lived her from 2006 2009 and the management was very friendly, especially Teresa, and the maintenance guys were very polite and on top of things.

The only thing that I really did not like were my neighbors. There were loud parties every weekend and children playing loudly and without supervision all day long. The police were there a lot for domestic violence (I checked the police reports). We were also robbed (probably by the neighborhood kids) as all they took were hand held electronics, candy, change, and soda. My parents hated the fact that I lived there because they thought it was unsafe and eventually convinced me to move. Overall I think that everything that the managers could control they did a great job with but when you live in mixed section 8 housing there is not much they can control when it comes to tenets.

20120227 14:25:12 nbsp I have lived at Suntree from 20102012, and it was an amazing experience. I lived in a 3 bed 1.5 bath and some worry that with only one shower, things get funky. But as long as you and roommates have different shower schedules, youll be fine. Rent for this year was 1500 for a 3 bedroom so thats 500 for each person if divided evenly and that is approx the cheapest for your own room unless youre sharing the room. They also take pets now as long as you pay the deposit. Also, the manager Teresa has been completely helpful. We had a lot of bad roommates that were not trying to pay rent and Teresa understood everything that we were going through and helped us every step of the way. We also have a washer and dryer in our apartment so it makes everything easy. The living room is a great size and each bedroom is also a good size. there is a large bedroom that can be shared for 2 people if the house wants a small rent. Yes, the apartment complex is old, but it is in a prime location on the E, P, Q, 42a/b. so its easy for you to get to campus quick. There is also 3 grocery stores close b if you need to pick something up quick.  Users/DavidThompson2012
