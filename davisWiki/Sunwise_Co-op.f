About
Sunwise Coop is a Cooperative Housing cooperative household in the Village Homes neighborhood in West Davis. Sunwise is an ecofriendly house run cooperatively, providing lowincome housing opportunities in Davis, California. The 8bedroom house is full of lowimpact features such as solar water heating, photovoltaic panels, passive solar design, and composting. We grow our own veggies in a big luscious garden, and enjoy the company of chickens and bees (and each other). We maintain the house through weekly chores and monthly workdays, share vegetarian dinners Monday through Thursday (with the occasional meat or vegan option), and make decisions by consensus during biweekly house meetings. All house members must be either students or earn less than 80% of median income for the region (in other words, less than $42,000).

Sunwise Coop is part of a nonprofit organization called the Solar Community Housing Association (SCHA) that includes two coops on J St.
downtown and, currently, The Domes on the UC Davis campus. Residents of our coop community have the opportunity to serve on the SCHA Board of
Directors, and help shape the future of the organization. SCHAs mission is to “...encourage and create community and respect for environment through
affordable, cooperative housing.”

We encourage you to join us for one of our house potluckstyle dinners Monday through Thursday at 7 p.m.! Also, our house work parties happen the second Sunday of each month starting at 9 am. If you are interested in joining us for dinner or a work party, please send an email at least a day or two in advance to sunwise.coop@gmail.com
