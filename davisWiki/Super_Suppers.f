Super Suppers was kind of like a delis deli, except that you took the food home to cook it. They saw themselves as providing fresh meals without your having to drive all over selecting ingredients and preparing them. You might think of them as having provided gourmet TV dinners. The prices were $$$ or upscale restaurants upscale: a regular entree (serves 3) was $16. No doubt the food was excellent, and comparable to restaurant prices. Yet, in a restaurants restaurant they cook it for you, serve it to you, and they provide the atmosphere and chance to get away from home.

The place had the appearance of a television kitchen, the type where the counters are spotless and all the pans shine. Unlike your kitchen (well, unless you keep a clean kitchen).

20070930 18:43:18 nbsp Great place.  Extremely friendly owners who bend over backwards to be nice, and act like they appreciate their customers. Pretty good food too! Users/DavisLurker

20071221 17:55:16 nbsp the food was great but i was a little miffed that i had to pay 24 bucks for potatoes, rice, and chicken with a bechamel (kind of like a roux but not) sauce. kindof expensive if you ask me. Users/EmilyTung

20080321 14:40:16 nbsp Im still confused. Do you take home a kit of ingredients or dishes that just need to be cooked and served?   Users/JimStewart
  You take home an assembled dish that you can just cook and serve (or freeze to cook later)... They differ from the stereotype TV dinner in that they require stovetop or oven cooking for 10  60 minutes instead of just microwaving. The idea is that you save time by not going to the grocery store and not having to clean up your own kitchen. You use their kitchen during a scheduled session or drop in time to prepare the provided ingredients into dishes ready to cook or freeze at home. You can also order specific preassembled dishes for pickup or stop by for preassembled grab and go dishes out of their freezer. Users/RyanCoates

20080424 19:07:26 nbsp Super Suppers may be convenient (I have my doubts), but dont let anyone convince you that their food is fresh.  I visited a few months ago and asked an employee where Super Suppers gets its ingredients.  After some prolonged hemming and hawing, she explained that they purchase most of their food from Sysco Food Systems.  Yes, thats right, that fresh squash in the fresh squash casserole was harvested whoknowswhere, whoknowshowlongago before it was cut, prepackaged, and sent to Super Suppers on the back of a Sysco Foods delivery truck.  Now, theres nothing wrong with a little preprepared Sysco food now and then.  Indeed, anyone who eats out would be hardpressed to avoid it.  But contrary to Super Suppers sales pitch, it is not the same as stopping by the grocery store, picking up some fresh ingredients, and making dinner from scratch.  Knowing this, you would be welladvised to save time and money by just eating dinner at Applebees (or some other chain restaurant that serves Sysco food).   Users/aafrancis

20080607 14:56:55 nbsp Oh no...I have to respond to the last comment because I used to work there (now it is a strictly family run business, they are sweet hearts)...and I actually remember you and this particular event, because that was me (the employee). I actually had no idea where we got our food, because obviously the owners order it and I remembered seeing cans and such with the Sysco label, etc. But I did look into it after you asked that and we got our food from several different sources General Produce (which deals in FRESH PRODUCE, which is where we got our FRESH SQUASH haha), Sysco, which provides the prepackaged things like canned bechamel, spices, etc, and also the good ol Costco, which the owners go themselves to pick out food for their store. Occasionally we would get produce from the grocery store for special orders. So Im sorry about the hemming and hawing, but dont assume thats because I was skirting around the issue (you skeptical thing you). Anyways I love love love the owners, and they are extremely nice people and yes, they will bend wayy backwards for their customers. So anyways I hope that clears things up, and we dont get precut vegetables etc, we all personally chop and dice for our customers to make sure we got the freshest ingredients possible.

And 24 dollars is the DISCOUNTED price for a SIX person meal, so really, you are paying 4 dollars per entree/person, which is pretty damn good considering you dont have to clean up after or prepare the food for yourself, and it is all fresh, and its a really fast way to get an easy meal.
