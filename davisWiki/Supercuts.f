 Location History 

September 1st, 2006 Supercuts closed their 407 G Street shop, and The Style Lounge took over the building as a second location.  Supercuts moved to Dixon as a result of new building ownership and not meeting franchise sales numbers.  All but one of the stylists moved with them to the new location.  In March 2007 Supercuts opened a new store at its current location in the Oak Tree Plaza.

20070813 00:22:32 nbsp The people were nice, but omg, I said half an inch off the top.  I had my stylist show me exactly how much it was.  She then proceeded to cut off 2 inches.  She then smiled and asked how I liked it.  What do you guys think?  Sarcasm or stupidity? Users/AlXBoi

20080426 17:43:10 nbsp The nice older female stylist has been in the hair game for a long time, and she used to be a Davisite. Good cuts from here guaranteed. Users/StevenDaubert

20080627 14:54:21 nbsp After I got a haircut I went home and realized that I needed just a little more cut off the back.  I went back there and they said that they would have to charge me full price to do that.  Dont waste your time or money with this place. I pretty much ended up cutting my own hair. Users/aberrier

20090118 15:30:15 nbsp All of the women who work here are very nice and only want to give you the haircut that you want.
If something is wrong, Im sure they would be more than happy to fix it or try and find a way to remedy the situation.
Instead of talking shit about your last haircut, how about you go back to that stylist and let them know what was wrong, or better yet, tell them while youre STILL IN THE CHAIR.

And by the way, the only reason they would make you pay full price to fix a haircut is if it has been over a week since the last time you were there.
I had to come back in once and the receptionist explained it to me.

Give these ladies a chance, they are there to cut your hair the way you want it and Im sure if any of them have read the things people say in their comments they would be heartbroken.

I love this place and all of the girls who work there, and Im sure if you were as open and honest with the stylists as I am, you would love it too. Users/misskatherine

20090222 11:59:02 nbsp I have been very happy with my haircuts from this particular Supercuts location. Ive had some bad experiences at some Supercuts locations in the Bay Area, but I think this Davis location is very reliable. There are two particular women at this location who I think are really good but I dont remember their names. Overall, the quality of a haircut varies widely from person to person whether you go to Supercuts, some other national brand, or a local barber or salon.  Users/Buckeye44

20090519 21:45:34 nbsp :/ i feel really dumb but I went here with a Great Clips coupon (thinking that the address said Covell instead of Cowell...easy mistake...right? :/). I asked them if they would honour it and they said yes, then I got my haircut and they said they wouldnt...because duh i was at the wrong salon! Wish they had told me though...plus side: I dont hate the haircut, I actually kind of love it :) Users/ArianeMetz

20090701 09:38:23 nbsp Great service! I go here all the time and they do a great job. I get a 2inch cut all the time, so basic, but exactly how I like it. I always get compliments at work for my hair cuts. Great new location also. I hardly ever have to wait.  Users/doggies9

20090707 16:43:23 nbsp These girls are terrific and are always really nice whenever I come in, esp. Katherine.  Every haircut Ive gotten here has been terrific. My whole family comes here.  I just wish they would start doing color !!  btw AAA Discount AAA members get 10% off. :)   Users/MaggeSanger

20091011 11:02:00 nbsp I usually get my haircut at PureBeauty and pay $45$60. Supercuts was recommended to me by a few people, and after reading the comments on this page, I thought Id give it a try.  Since most Supercuts have a horrible rep I was a bit skeptical but all I wanted was a trim and to get my layers freshened up. I called in and got an appointment the same day. The staff was friendly and my hairdresser was Chelsea, I think (She had short blonde hair). Chelsea did a good job on the bangs but my layers came out horrible! Youd think layers would be simple enough to do with long hair but it came out super uneven! She didnt even completely blow dry my hair. I walked out with wet hair and uneven layers. I could have done a better job myself! The haircut was only $15, so I guess you get what you pay for. They do have a decent collection of Matrix and Paul Mitchell hair products that are currently on sale. But Im definitely not going back again.  Users/MillaMi

20091112 11:37:44 nbsp Worst hair cut ever. AVOID JACKIE!! Shes terrible  bad attitude, does not take direction well, and gave me all kinds of weird layers. Cant they hire decent hairdressers with nice attitudes. God, what a piece of shit.  Users/DolceVita

20100222 16:04:00 nbsp I have never had much luck with Supercuts until a while ago when I went to get my hair cut a good 4 inches, and a bit longer in the back with a good amount of layers.  I scheduled an appointment with Jackie, the manager and she did a great job, Im very happy with it. I will always now go there and have Jackie cut my hair. She took her time, and make sure I liked it. I came in once one day and then the next day because I decided to get it shorter and more layered, and a bit thinned out. She wasnt mad, she made some suggestions on hair treatment, and I left a happy costumer. Very good price, and its inexpensive to get a shampoo with the hair cut. I highly suggest Jackie, you get a good haircut at a great price Users/GiulianaWasHere

20100607 09:04:56 nbsp I have had very good cuts at this Supercuts. I have also had a few bad ones. It didnt take too long to find two very good cutters there: Katherine and Lien. I highly recommend both of them.

20100615 20:05:01 nbsp I went about a year ago, and I loved what the stylist (I dont remember who) did to my hair.

I went today, and Cynthia cut my hair too short and in a different style than I asked. Users/LauraKaroly

20100627 00:11:21 nbsp I just got my hair cut here yesterday. The girl was relatively new, and not that experienced. If you can, request the older asian lady, she is the best. I wish I could remember her name. All of the staff are super nice, and the wait is never long. You can also book an appointment!   Users/reviewaskew

20100708 08:29:09 nbsp Free Haircut when I donated my  hair.
I know everyone out there is trying to work very hard in life and I understand that as a customer I could say something while in the chair.  However, to be honest, I didnt really know what I was entitled to with the free hair cut(blow dry, style, etc after a hair cut).  The lady that did my hair seemed very nice (Christine?) but she spent probably 1015 minutes on me.  She didnt blow dry my hair, which Im fine with usually, but she did not even attempt to get rid of the excess hair, yeah I know that there is always excess hair after getting a hair cut but Im not exaggerating, when I took a shower, there were over 100 pieces of hair that were an inch long.  Then when my hair finally dried, I noticed how uneven it was, with a big chunk on the right side missing, which I could of said something about if she had blow dried a little bit and had let me seen the job she has done.

Again, please dont think Im ungrateful or was passive about my hair cut, its difficult to be opinionated when someone is pushing you out of the chair and already attempting to say hello to the following customer even before I attempted to give her a tip.  Also, I would have been happier with it if she had not attempted to style it and then not care about it, but she actually took a lot off and therefore when i went to get it fixed at a salon, they had to cut it shorter to trim off the mistakes.

Maybe some of the other stylists are good so dont just avoid this place based on this and ask whether or not a blow dry is included in the free haircut.

I felt good about donating my hair, but then I was treated as though I had a free gift certificate that they didnt really want anyone to use. Users/BamCam

20100918 13:10:59 nbsp I got a trim from Christine (Asian woman in her 40s); she was nice, did a fine job, and was very fast. My boyfriend got a very good, simple haircut from a blond lady in her 40s. If you want something basic, its a good place to go! Users/zombiek

20101016 20:23:25 nbsp Horrible haircut, avoid Cindy like the Black Plague, unless if you want to look like a square. Save your money and go elsewhere. (Male, 18)

20101022 20:10:24 nbsp TERRIBLE HAIRCUT, as the poster said above, avoid Cindy like a plague...she is careless and can ruin your day and hair

20110121 14:14:36 nbsp ( Male, 23, straight hair, no fancy cut) I had been going to the same barbers shop since I was in the 3rd grade and now I have to switch because I live up here. I really dont know what people are moaning about, its a $15 haircut, which is a steal these days.  If youre expecting to walk out of here with a $40 haircut you should probably go elsewhere and just spend the money.  I read all of these reviews and it sounded similar to my experience with $15 cuts before; you dont always get a great cut, but if youre not too picky then who cares?

I had Jackie, who someone said was terrible, and she was way more attentive than the barber Ive been going to for years.  Asked lots of questions, stopped along the way and was quick and efficient.  My haircut isnt super complicated, but why would it be if Im only paying $15.  Honestly this is one of the best $15 cuts Ive had in a while! Users/rhsinton

20110501 21:28:52 nbsp Jackie did an excellent job cutting the hair of my 2yearold daughter. One can only imagine what its like to to keep a 2yearold from getting frightened and then cutting her hair perfectly straight despite her constant wiggling and inability to sit still. This was no easy task. Jackie managed to pull it off beautifully and is deserving of much kudos! Users/Buckeye44

20110714 00:06:35 nbsp (Male, 21) I was very pleased with my hair cut. Not only did they cut my hair the way that I asked them to, but they did it in very little time. I would definitely recommend this place! Users/ChrisCosta

20110807 16:41:31 nbsp I went in today and Cynthia cut my hair right away.  She was very professional and fast.  Overall she did a good job, especially for the cost.  The value of my haircut at Davis Supercuts was high! Users/bartbart

20110817 10:36:35 nbsp I brought in a picture of a haircut so that there would be no confusion. Now I look like a Lego Man. Dont go here, find a barber that cares. Users/tompaul

20110926 23:10:14 nbsp Another great haircut. It is nice to have a professional job every once in a while when every other haircut is a quick clipper job :D Users/Greenlover48

20120616 09:08:00 nbsp I have been having my hair cut at Supercuts for years and the best I can say is that it all depends on the cutter.  I never see the same one twice (the turnover seems to be pretty quick).  Ive had fantastic cuts, and horrible cuts.  Its catch as catch can...but the price is right. Users/BevSykes

20120811 13:00:57 nbsp Overall, its a cheap haircut for a cheap price.  I suppose its hard to complain for the cost, but I wasnt thrilled.
I went in for a haircut about 2 hours after opening.  I was the only one there and I felt super rushed in and out.  The whole process took less than 15 minutes.  No one offered to do a wash and dry, which I would have paid for (though I usually go to a place that does $15 for a wash and cut).

Even after explaining that I do part my hair the way I had it when I walked in and wanted to keep it that way and she clarified, she still decided about halfway through the cut to change the part.  When she was done cutting, she didnt even bother to brush it out (it looked like I had just rolled out of bed, not like I had just come out of a haircut), and seemed kind of put off that I wanted to see the back of my hair in the mirror.  I came home, brushed it, and fixed it back to the way I normally wear it.  It looks pretty silly.
On the plus side, she did at least hear me when I said I just wanted the bottoms evened out and to try and keep the length.

Next time, Im driving to another town to get my hair cut, even though Supercuts is a 4 minute bike ride from my place. Users/MeganR

20121209 10:12:11 nbsp Its Russian Roulette for hair. You might get a good cut, or you might want to shave your head afterwards. At least thats been my experience after going here off and on for years. If you think, Its just hair, it grows back, then go on in. If you are uptight about your hair, then you ought to pay a bit more and go elsewhere.  Users/GordonCaulkins

20130118 09:10:36 nbsp I got my long hair trim here, didnt realize it wasnt cut straight until someone pointed out. I am really upset that they cannot cut a straight line! Been here twice and got the same results! Could just have someone whos not a Cosmetologist and do a better job. Dont even go to this place, its a rip off!  Users/pah
