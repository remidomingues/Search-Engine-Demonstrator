20110912 12:25:32 nbsp My catalytic converter had been stolen and I needed it fixed fast. AAA recommended Superior Auto Body in Dixon so I went with them based upon the great reviews I found online. Initially I was given fast and friendly service, but when my car was not ready on the date it was quoted at, I called the place only to find out they had not received the parts and did not know where they were. I was annoyed at not having been told this. They called back saying the place where the parts had been ordered from did not have any and they had requested from an alternate place. An additional week would have to go by. The part was installed fine but I was not pleased by the lack of communication and slow service.  Users/CarlosOverstreet
