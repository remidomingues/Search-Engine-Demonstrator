20110608 22:30:51 nbsp Been coming here a few weeks now for Muay Thai. I first started learning Muay Thai from Ty at Elite Instinct Mixed Martial Arts Academy until they dropped the striking classes and turned into a Brazilian JiuJitsu only place. I then checked out his classes at the Davis Athletic Club but found them to be too recreational so I finally ended up coming here. I really dislike having to go all the way out to Sac, but its definitely worth it. Everyone is friendly (so far havent met any arrogant jerks who have heavy hands when its light sparring) and you can decide whether you want to train for recreation, fitness, or fighting. Also, they dont pressure you to join like many gyms do. Would recommend to a friend / 10. Users/hankim
