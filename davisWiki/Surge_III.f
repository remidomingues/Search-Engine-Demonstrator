Surge III is part of the Academic Surge Surge complex of buildings located just south of Hutchison Drive  the Silo portion of campus. It appears to be connected to Surge I. Perhaps it was an addition onto that building.

A bunch of vet school programs are located there that are not directly related to becoming a veterinarian (thats not all the vet school is, afterall).  Masters and PhD research degree programs are two examples.  The Masters in Veterinary Preventative Medicine department has a building and several rooms.  Theres a few computer labs for graduate computer labs, such as for some statistic classes for other vet programs.  Theres a few conference rooms. several offices and an informal meeting area with couches, a fridge, and a microwave.

Surge III also features a lecture hall, room 1309. Many nonVet classes are held here. There are two doors, each one the right and left sides of the room. The main entrance is on the (right when seated). This classroom features the annoying chairs that are lifted up from the floor and are attached to several long, flat, rows of table space, while reducing the ability to walk through without having to squeeze though. This makes it hard to get to the middle spaces when the room is full.
BRYCEH: Ive had a CRD class and a History class in that classroom.
