There are gardens that produce more fruit and vegetables than the gardeners want. There are people who would eat ripe produce, especially if they didnt need to pay for it. By using comments and the MailTo(somebody AT emailaddress DOT net) macro, perhaps people can offer produce to be picked up by those who want it.

Please note that there is a The Freecycle Network Freecycling network thats got a vibrant http://groups.yahoo.com/group/DavisFreecycle/ Davis group. This page is another way such free transactions might occur.



20090805 20:14:17 nbsp Isnt this similar to Fruit core, and on the wiki, the free food entry? wiki:gnome:Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
  Similar, in that the intent is exactly the same. Different, in that gardeners often dont want a fruit core harvesting for them. They want to leave bags of zucchini on someones doorstep. This could facilitate such free food deliveries and pick ups. Thanks for the cross reference  I wonder if Fruit core would like a link to this page? Users/DougWalter
