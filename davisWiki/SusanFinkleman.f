Hi Susan! I understand your concerns about the cemetery page, especially within regards to the photo with the cones. Nonetheless, much of the wiki community has been somewhat strongly against photo removal in the past. Not wanting to appear Draconian in this matter, I opened a Davis Cemetery/Talk discussion page in order to get community input.
