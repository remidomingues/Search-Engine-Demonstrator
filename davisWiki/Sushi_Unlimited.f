Sushi Unlimited is a Japanese food Japanese restaurant and sushi bar, located in the building where Mirai used to be. On their opening day they served only sushi but offered a 20% discount (excluding alcohol and sashimi). Despite their suggestive name, this restaurant does not offer an allyoucaneat sushi buffets buffet. However, the menu does include a large number of sushi choices, including a good number of Vegetarian Options veggie sushi options, as well as fare such as chicken and steak teriyaki. The decor is mostly dark and black, with a sushi bar in the center, dance music playing quietly in the background, and HDTVs on two walls. Wednesday is karaoke night, starting at 9:00PM; they stop serving the regular menu after 9:30PM but continue to serve food from a modified menu until closing at 1:00AM (you might want to call before you come, as karaoke night is sometimes cancelled). As of 20090128, there were some Korean dishes offered as specials.

There are two other Sushi Unlimited restaurants. One is located in Roseville, the home of the owner, and the other is in Folsom. Their Roseville location also has a karaoke night.

20080112 23:15:46 nbsp Service was good and friendly, the vegetable tempura was good as well as the agedashi tofu.  It is a bit pricey for college students... but its okay to go there once in a while... Users/AiYaZone

20080131 00:15:52 nbsp Because of Sushi establishments like Sushi Unlimited and Moshi Moshi I have mostly sworn off of buffets. The food here tastes fresh, and the presentation is really nice. Sometimes they are a little repetitive on the saucing of the sushi, but I can deal with it. I have been able to get the chef choice dinner special for take out, but recently they have seem to not allow that anymore. I have to warn everyone about the karaoke machine. Too many sake bombs + 3 backstreet boys songs later do not equal fun. Users/AmyTrinh

20080211 10:42:49 nbsp we have eaten here several times, it has been good every time.  Has a lot of different Mikuni type rolls, and classic Japanese place food.  we have eaten there both with a group of adults, and with just my family... if the service is slow, they make it right with free goodies usually, and service is attentive even if they are busy!   Users/Carsonsig

20080213 23:11:28 nbsp went there for some good asian food BUT HAD A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. The sushi might be okay or good but my girlfriend and i got the chicken and it was horrible and expensive.  We ate maybe one piece of our chicken (no white meat, only fatty parts) and told the waiter (when he finally came back 1520 minutes later to when he came to see how it was) that it was not good at all and we still ended up paying 36 dollars for food we barely touched.  The food took also very long time to come out.  We had to get up to get more soda.  The only thing good was the soda, steamed rice, and edemame.  I dont see how everything took so long and how service was so bad when there were 7 workers and four customers in the building.   Users/nico

20080226 00:42:33 nbsp sp roll is good, chicken donburi is bad (too sweet) Users/YooHyunOak

20080226 20:07:18 nbsp Ive gotten both unagi and salmon (sake) here.  On the IDoNotExist sushimeter, Sushi Unlimited rated the following:

Price: moderate to high  comparable to a good sushi establishment in San Francisco or another major city
Unagi: The best Ive had in Davis.  Good, although it tasted more like the unagi sauce than the eel itself.  Fresh and tasty, but not comparable to what is available in San Francisco. Rating: 3/5
Salmon: Dry and a bit tough.  Not a good sign in raw fish.  Not very flavorful.  Rating 1/5.
Atmosphere: A nice place.  The nicest sushi place Ive seen in Davis.

Recommendation: A nice place to eat, but the sushi doesnt match the high price.  If you really crave good sushi at these prices, you can find many much better restaurants in SF, although you clearly lose something in convenience.  If you are looking for a good price for the (not so great) quality that you get, consider one of the restaurants downtown. Users/IDoNotExist

20080308 22:06:26 nbsp I love this place.  Hamachi all the way!!!! Users/changychang

20080413 22:04:12 nbsp I just returned from eating dinner here. It was very fresh and delicious. The sushi was far better than any of the sushi I have had anywhere else in Davis. Users/Chantal

20080430 12:03:54 nbsp lol some of the people who comment on this restaurant shouldnt be allowed near a computer. so onto the restaurant, service is terrible, and you will not change my mind. the food was good, i will definitely give it that but $17 for teriyaki? you must be out of your mind. sushi roll prices are not bad but other then that the prices were horrendous. try going to sac if you want amazing sushi thats well priced since you definitely will not find it in davis with the rich kids whose parents pay for everything while they galavant thoughout the city and since they are so willing to pay the higher price, vendors definitely dont have a problem keeping things unaffordable. Users/simplyg00d

20080503 20:29:39 nbsp If you love Zen Toro youll kind of like Sushi Unlimited...if you love fuji chef youll love wet dog food (in roll form of course).  The service was also stellar. Users/WalleyWorld

20080519 00:22:37 nbsp Ive been here multiple times and usually the food has usually been good albeit pricey.  I havent been back since this past March because of the bad service I experienced.  My girlfriend and I were seated and our server, Chad, greeted us and brought us a pot of hot tea.  That was the last time we spoke to him for the rest of the half hour we stayed.  Chad served tables all around us, but after he dropped off the tea, he never came back to take our order.  I wish I could say he was busy, but when he wasnt taking orders or serving, he was flirting with the female staff by the soda dispenser.  We made eye contact on multiple occasions and even gestured to him, but he never came back.  After almost 45 minutes, we  got up and left.  On the way out, the hostess asked us if everything was okay and we told her we never got served.  All she could say was, oh.  There were no apologies, no efforts to please us or even attempts to notify the manager on our behalf.  We havent been back there since, and I no longer recommend it to anyone I like. Users/CPJ

20080607 16:21:04 nbsp Sushi unlimited, I thought that ment all you can eat. The only thing unlimited here is the price of your bill. The sushi is great but way, way over priced. Users/Kicker

20080623 22:29:03 nbsp Well, we went once, that was enough.  The sushi chef was a second year college kid dressed like Lil Wayne in a 2004 rap video, and for some reason kept staring at our group with a dirty look on his face; did not make for a comfortable dining experience.  The sushi rice was bad, the fish was very average.  Since nothing was particularly good or tasty, we thought it was terribly overpriced.  Well pay good money for good sushi, here we payed good money for a poor meal, served by an angry chef.  In Davis I recommend Osaka and Moshi Moshi, they have many loyal and happy customers because they do a good job. Users/Trevor

20080627 21:36:41 nbsp By far the best sushi restaurant Ive been to in Davis, and Ive tried a lot of them. The sushi was fresh, the unagidon was good, and the service was pretty good. It was a bit more expensive than other restaurants in Davis, but worth it.

There is one piece of sushi that me and my friend both hated though. We ordered a sushi plate of chefs choices, and one of the choices was a strange white, rubbery thing with a mint leaf and a dab of hot sauce on top. Totally disgusting. I tried to chew off a small piece, but couldnt do it. My friend, who eats pretty much everything, actually spit it out. If you see it on your plate, dont eat it. Youve been warned. Users/st3phi3

20080705 19:34:29 nbsp GOD AWFUL.  My god!  How does this place stay in business?!!?!? Users/JimBob

20080706 03:16:30 nbsp I think its because people know what good sushi tastes like and enjoy good service and a friendly atmosphere my jimbob troll friend Users/JJNasca

20080720 01:19:34 nbsp I bit more expensive than I thought, but I enjoy the bulkogi box special. I think its a good deal. Their godfather roll is really good too, they dont put too much cheese which is good. Another good thing about this place is that they put real seafood in their sushi. Also, theyve recently added Italian desserts to their menu.  Users/cnk.midori

20080721 01:33:30 nbsp I love how when someone takes a #2, the smell goes all the way to the tables(lack of fan in restroom). The service is incredibly slow most of the times. Most of their chefs have very little experience. Food is overpriced for what you get.
Zen Toro > Sushi Unlimited !!!  Users/jaredfromsubway

20080724 19:43:46 nbsp TERRIBLE service! Both times Ive done takeout theyve forgotten key things (e.g. the sauce for the tempura dinner), and when you call to let them know, they dont offer to do anything about it. Will never go here again. Users/odg7

20080821 16:15:51 nbsp The food isnt the cheapest but it still tastes good. GODFATHER ROLL YUM! Users/renee415

20080919 14:46:55 nbsp My first time here I thought it was really bad. However, my subsequent two times going it was actually really good! They have good appetizers and really good specialty rolls (spicy santa!) Also, I went with a group of about 15 people and we only had the one waitress (Evie i think?) and she was amazing!! It is a little expensive but I feel like I can never finish what i order anyway! (i.e.: lots of food despite the price!)  Users/endavis

20081021 18:02:37 nbsp I made a Davis wiki account just for this.  The food is NOT fresh and is NOT worth the money! Moshi Moshi, my regular sushi place, was closed saturday afternoon when I decided to place a pick up order at sushi unlimited.  I ordered the lunch special, #2 I believe, that included four pieces of nigiri sushi and five pieces of sashimi  chefs choice.  In addition, I ordered miso soup, edamame and an iced tea.  The resulting bill was $18. They had two tables of four people each and I figured they wouldnt take long for my simple order.  After 25 minutes of sitting in the restaurant, I asked the waiter how much longer it would be.  He answered saying my order was difficult to make but was almost done. When he brought it to me, I discovered the pieces of sashimi were TINY not to mention not very fresh!! barely 2 centimeters squared! In addition he seemed to have forgotten my miso soup, edamame and iced tea...which I had to tail after him and ask for.  Without an apology, he rushed away.  Later when eating my nigiri, I found the rice to be dry.  I have never had seriously BAD sushi, but Sushi Unlimited not only gave me terrible sushi, they charged me a boatload for my bitesized pieces.  I am thoroughly dissatisfied! GO TO MOSHI MOSHI! for two more dollars you get twice the amount of food...and its fresh! Users/priya

20081021 18:11:00 nbsp I have been here once or twice and I really enjoyed it.  I cannot claim to be a true sushi connaseiur, but I thought this establishment was quite classy; a bit expensive tho Users/ChrisWaterstraat

20081111 22:38:00 nbsp A very decent place for some nice sushi dinner in davis. No where else can be better than it. Users/AvilaVoom

20081123 13:40:20 nbsp I had my birthday here last night and I would recommend this place to anyone!  We had 30 people and Sushi Unlimited was so accommodating and friendly.  The service was great, everyone remarked how they loooovvveed the food.  I asked for the karaoke machine and they let us go to town.  They stayed open late, made planning very easy and were all in all wonderful.  Best sushi in Davis!   Users/VictoriaArmstrong

20090208 01:49:16 nbsp I had dinner here with my friend last night and we both agreed that it was one of the best meals weve had in Davis so far! I got the Tempura California Roll which was delicious! It was basically a California Roll with a ring of tempura around it. I highly recommend this place. The restaurant was clean and modern. The service was a little slow but well worth it. We will definitely be going again. Users/Rhymenocerous

20090220 18:32:17 nbsp Best sushi ever! Reggae man + Mels + Folsom city  heaven. 20% discount with online coupon! Users/coolspiros

20090223 14:35:17 nbsp I recommend Jubillie is you like cream cheese in your roll. It was delicious. I wish the prices were less expensive, but Ill definitely go back. Users/KRSanta88

20090223 14:55:22 nbsp Had dinner here a couple weeks ago. The service was excellent but the sushi was ... well, I dont like to be mean, but it was pretty bad, especially for the price of the rolls, which was a dollar or two more than other subexcellent sushi places in town. Also, be careful with the spicy rolls. They are REALLY spicy! Usually, spicy means, slightly tingly. My wife and I couldnt even finish the rolls and we eat hot food all the time. I wouldnt swear off this place altogether because the service was great and I want to try to do the karaoke thing eventually. But I hope the sushi is better next time, especially for what you pay. Users/condemned2bfree

20090315 11:38:11 nbsp This is a recurring theme in my comments on restaurants, but I think sticklers for tradition and authenticity are really missing out.
Sushi Unlimited is one of my favorite restaurants in town, and certainly my goto for sushi.
I love the fastfood or American style sushi, with all the interesting sauces and ingredients. The Simba roll is one of my favorites, with its cheesy sauce, and the Jubilee is good too, with crab salad. Rocklin roll is another one I like, the whole shebang is tenpura fried and topped off with two addictive sauces.

So aside from the somewhat mindboggling array of rolls (which I think are the shining achievements on the menu), the soups are tasty and for $10 you can get an udon soup bowl with tenpura on the side... the shrimp is delicious!

As to the service, Im a fan of going up to the bar and watching the chefs work, and even before I was a regular the staff was friendly. The chefs are great for a chat (my best friend has the biggest crush on one of them ;D ) and if you come in often it becomes even more fun. They remember what you like and make good suggestions for trying new stuff, too!

A couple things to keep in mind...
If youre not adventurous or a sushi virgin, theres plenty of variety even for basic stuff. A good first step is the Philadelphia roll or any of those other basic rolls. Still not into it? Try the soup or other hot items. You dont HAVE to order sushi.
Talk to the chefs! If you know what you like and dont like, let them know and they can help you pick something out. Also, need to customize a bit? No problem. Ive got a friend that hates nori, and its no big deal to have it left out.
Try coming in at odd hours. Ive never had to wait for a table or spot at the bar when I come in around 5:30 or so.
You get what you pay for! This is pricier than, say, Fuji Chef, but its definitely higher quality. If youre not picky about your food and looking for a great bargain, this may not be the place for you. Its a notch below, say, Mikuni (which will be moving in where Fuzio was, or so Ive heard) both in quality and in price.
Even on a student budget you can get a great meal, especially if you come in with friends and order to split. You get the variety. Heres my method...
  In a group of 4 people, for example, get 1 item each to start. A bowl of udon is great (theyre big bowls, ask for smaller bowls if you want to share around) and split the tenpura on the side, then go for 3 different rolls. If youre a big eater like me and want more, get a side bowl of rice to bulk up that soup and order two basic rolls for the price of one special roll. I really love getting the Philly and a tunavo with the spicy santa sauce on the side.

...and now Im hungry.
 Users/KBathory

20090425 17:26:36 nbsp Service here is definitely hit or miss  Ive had it be amazing one day and horrible the next!  The sushi is great though and reasonably priced! Users/cfb

20090510 18:57:14 nbsp This place has the best chicken udon hands down, everyone should try it!!! Users/jaredfromsubway

20090515 20:12:53 nbsp SLOWEST SERVICE EVER. but good sushi. they never fill up your water. ever. takes hours to get your check... sit at the bar to get food faster. Users/julpham

20090611 14:01:41 nbsp Although I have to admit I think I liked this place a little better when it was Mirai, I end up coming here frequently, and am rarely disappointed with the food. The specialty rolls are generally huge, and the appetizers usually very fresh and good (the agedashi tofu is a favorite). Both the Little Green Coupon Book and other local junk mail feature regular coupons for 20% off your bill, so this place isnt any more expensive than Zen Toro. I do have to say that the service here is less than stellar. Ive seen waitresses having (openly) catty disagreements and fights on the serving floor in front of customers, and the waitstaff always seems to be in a bad mood (and pretty slow  it once took them 45 mnutes to bring out 2 speciality rolls, and my friend and I were the only two people in the resaturant). If you want to block out their vibes, your best option is to sit at the bar and order directly from the sushi chefs. Users/calvin2

20090625 09:49:33 nbsp As Sushi Unlimited is right across from my apartment complex, I have frequented this restaurant many times. However, I would say its really worth the money. The meals are overpriced, and now, having been to Mikunis, I would have to say that their sashimi isnt spectacular. If I was in a real sushi craving without a ride downtown, I would go here. Otherwise, not really worth it.

Also, one time I came with my parents here, and they let my sister and I order off the kids menu, but when I came back another time with my friends they wouldnt let us order off the kids menu. Unfortunate, because the kids portions are a lot better for the price.  Users/aileen

20090705 16:19:42 nbsp Excellent Bento boxes all around.  Fantastic tempura (broccoli, sweet potato, carrot, onion ring, shrimp) and great tentsuyu (soy, mirin, etc mixture for dip).  Pork Bulgogi had a slightly sweeter take than what Im used to but was pretty good.  The light Asian peanut sauce on the salad that came with the meal was excellent.  The Oshinko roll (pickled daikon) was spot on although I suppose there is not much to mess up there.  The gyoza (potstickers) were tasty too.  Excellent serving sizes.  The Don Katsu was said to be excellent and the croquettes were lauded as well.  Very tasty marinated bean sprouts.  As an appetizer we had Jalapenos filled with crab or maybe imitation crab but was pretty good and spicy. Essentially everything was great except the iced tea tasted a little funky.  Service was very good and the bathrooms were clean.  Although, one member of my party thought it odd there are two toilets without dividers in the single occupancy womens washroom :)  Users/RyanMikulovsky

20090708 17:49:51 nbsp Service is soooooo SLOW and theyre never even packed. Sushi off of their buy1get1 menu sucks. stick to the reg menu Users/ILikeToEat

20091027 11:12:07 nbsp This is my favorite restaurant in Davis. Their service is consistent and the food is amazing. Try the zoro hand roll (i get mine without spicyness); its a religious experience.  Users/Jeserah

20091029 20:44:05 nbsp HORRIBLE service. Only came to our table twice. Had to wave them down for service. Made rude comments when asked for more sauce. The waiters hang out more in the back and chat and dont help costumers and if a customer asks they act very bothered. Never will i go there again.  Users/psneer

20091106 10:44:02 nbsp I have always loved to eat at this place, good food, great service, good chefs..up until recently. Chefs and some staff are still great, but there are a few people who really make this place extremely disagreeable. Especially the newest manager/waitress  she always messes up orders, is rude to customers, and does not know what she is doing. I have also witnessed her acting in appropriately with her staff  yelling at them in front of customers for no reason when she is doing nothing herself to alleviate the work load for the staff. Unfortunately, because of her presence, this is not an enjoyable place to be or eat. I feel sorry for the staff there because they have to deal with her. I do not recommend going to this place simply because of the lack of professional customer service & management. Too bad because this place used to be so great with wonderful food and service  especially during Karaoke nights & lunches. Please spare yourself the embarrassment and eat somewhere else.  Users/0001customer100

20100402 13:14:15 nbsp I love this place.  Great service and the half off menu is awesome! Users/mwalters

20100506 14:58:13 nbsp The rolls are very good and many are regularly half off.  They have many things to choose from.  Food is consistently fresh and very good.  The service, however, can be strange.  You can be ignored for a VERY long time. Sometimes I wonder if the waitstaff is even assigned a specific station or if Im always seated in the Twilight Zone.  Im pretty patient, so this remains my favorite sushi restaurant in Davis. Users/toriac

20100514 22:15:52 nbsp Ill agree with everyone who says service isnt so good. The staff seemed overworked and not knowledgeable about either the sushi or Saki. Service was VERY slow except for the sake. The food its self is ok but nothing to write home about. The one redeeming feature of Unlimited is the hot sake is pretty cheap as is the rest of the cold sake selection. The plentiful sake alone made the meal acceptable.  Users/ARWENNHOLD

20100717 22:07:03 nbsp For the price, this is the best place to get sushi.  Everything is very tasty and pretty cheap.  The service I found to be a little lacking, but it seemed to me that they just did not have enough people, everyone was working pretty hard.  The restaurant is a little dark, but I actually like it that way.  It works well for this place. Users/ThomasGoeson
 It could be said that they have Soft lighting, and were possibly more busy than anticipated.  We were a group of 5, and there seemed to be another family or two in the place at the same time.  Users/MasonMurray

20100718 20:51:01 nbsp amazing sushi! i love the river cat, service is always good, the price is just perfect! go for the lunch special for the edamame!! ill be going back like i have been again and again! Users/melamazing

20100810 21:40:11 nbsp This place has the highest quality fish and flavor/texture combinations you are going to find in Davis.  Their portions are much larger than Mikuni, and they have a wider variety of rolls on their menu, not to mention the price is right. I have been there several times, but for dinner tonight and we got the Bon Appetite and Jlo roll, BBQ albacore (which is twice the size as the appetizer at Mikuni), a spicy tuna hand roll, unagi, rice and two sodas for 45 dollars! The sushi bar is huge, and the Chefs will make any special roll you can think of.  Tae is the BEST, he is a sushi master.  Users/mollyringwald

20100818 11:20:24 nbsp They have the best chicken udon I have ever had. Users/ashleyinthemist

20101011 18:27:44 nbsp I like this place.  It is usually pretty crowded but Ive never had to wait.  They have an extensive menu of specialty rolls, many of which are excellent.  THey also have a half price menualthough they seem to ALWAYS have it, so Im not sure thats really half price if no one pays full price!
Service CAN be goodbut on occasion Ive felt forgotten about.  The waiters are adorable so theyre worth the wait!  :)
I know this is an unusual request for a sushi restaurant, but a couple of darker beers, or maybe an IPA would be divine!  (I know, I know, those arent Asian beersbut that would make it perfect for me!) Users/toriac

20101105 18:48:06 nbsp Since Davis Sushi stopped offering takeout we had to find a new place and went with this. They were running a 50% off all rolls which was awesome. We got the River Cat, Teri Roll, Crazzzy, New Cali & Arizona with a Sake Bomb appetizer. I liked the River Cat and Arizona best. The Crazzy and New Cali are warm and Im not a fan of warmed sushi. The Sake Bombs were great.
I know they usually run a 20% off coupon in the Green Machine, assume its for dinein only, and my husband hates using coupons so we havent taken advantage of it.
We ate in once before when we lived in NE Davis and our waiter was very nice. Users/BaggedMilk

20101213 19:34:47 nbsp Never been in here when its really busy, so my service has always been really quick.  Also, SUPER cheap sake bombs!!! Our waitress was even cool with us making a huge mess after doing them, and was ready with extra napkins. Users/AndrewWalker

20110124 09:44:24 nbsp Really good service in the bar area from the bartender Hector.  Also, until they get their hard liquor license, they have some sweet deals on beer and sake. Users/EliYani

20110213 12:12:38 nbsp This place as THE BEST Sushi in Davis. Hands down. They have a very large 1/2 price Sushi roll menu (I think most are under $57) and weve sampled pretty much every one of their rolls and all are delicious, so no matter which one you go with youll be happy. They are open until 10pm which is great when youre stuck working late and dont want to cook. Every time weve gone there its been packed, but weve been seated and served right away  so Im not sure why some of you say you find the service slow. LOVE this place! Users/Bryna

20110324 17:18:38 nbsp Too pricey and the fish is very poor quality.  I ordered a rainbow roll and I couldnt even recognize one of the pieces of fish. I didnt eat it.  A waste of my money. Wont ever go back. Users/YogiJen

20110326 16:37:38 nbsp This place is awesome. The 50% off rolls are the way to go. Delicious rolls with cream cheese (my favorites!). Ive never had problems with service and I usually go on Saturday nights when it is relatively busy. I just wish this place was closer to downtown. Users/OliviaHenry

20110326 22:23:18 nbsp one of my more favorable places to eat sushi in Davis. Every time Ive gone, the fish have always been decent. If you want really good sushi in Davis, dont bother but this place is better of the bunch. Im glad this place doesnt serve buffet like most other Davis sushi joints because quite frankly, the words buffet and sushi does not equate to something good. In order to fill masses of people, buffets tend to use middle of the road or worse quality fish so its a good thing they dont serve buffet here. Of all the places Ive tried sushi in Davis, Ive enjoyed unlimited the best so far.  Users/C.Ling

20110327 14:50:11 nbsp This is one of the few restaurants in the area that offers dining points for Alaska Airlines. I like to get takeout here, as they package it very carefully. Users/NoelBruening

20110519 16:05:35 nbsp The bar area is where its at! Hector is awesome, they have a full bar now, and service/food is great! A great place to relax. Users/scarroll

20110606 06:49:38 nbsp WORSE SERVICE EVER! they are so slow. even when they arent busy. i dont know what takes them so long. the only good thing about this place is the half off rolls. POOR POOR POOR POOR service. Users/Lisaaa

20110709 11:28:20 nbsp Great food, usually service has been good but last night it wasnt.  Our waitress was very abrupt and asked us Are you ready? while we were still reading the menu!!  Wish I got her name; she was a taller Asian gal. It was a Friday night around closing.  Then she took our soy sauce WHILE WE WERE STILL EATING.  It was getting close to closing time so she was trying to get out of there.  And she cleared our table right as me and my friend were in the middle of a discussion...she didnt ask if we were done or apologize...just reached out between us and cleared the table.  We were shocked.  And she didnt say thank you when she took our bill rather abruptly.  When she brought is back, she mumbled thank you and quickly walked by.  I have never had such bad service...I barely write on Davis wiki, but I had to write this.  Other service has been good; this girl was horrible!!  My friend tipped 20% because he didnt have change...otherwise it would have been a lot less.   Users/KMeo

20110711 12:35:36 nbsp Sushi here is good and prices are decent. I like the torched rolls the best. Service isnt horrible, but isnt great either.

Their specials are a great deal, but if you want to save on their regular menu then check out the Little Green Machine coupons. Theres usually a coupon for 20% off (I think). Users/mechee

20110711 13:02:43 nbsp Sushi Unlimited probably has the best value for sushi in Davis.  While I think Zen Toro has the highest quality in town, its got a price tag to match.  Sushi Unlimited is a small step below ZT, but its a HUGE step above most of the other places in town.  Most of the halfprice rolls are in the $68 range, and if youve got a health appetite, youll probably eat 2.  Theres great variety in ingredients, sauces, etc.  All of the fish Ive had in the half dozen times Ive eaten here has been very fresh.

Theres one big downside, and thats the service.  Its always friendly enough, its just slooooooow.  We went last weekend and waited about a half hour for our rolls after ordering.  After maybe 20 minutes they brought out some free edamame, which they often do, but it was a long wait.  Unfortunately, its not unusual. Users/TomGarberson
 A quick update: weve been sitting at the sushi bar whenever possible the last few times.  Service is generally much better. tg

20110721 09:30:03 nbsp came in here with some friends the other day and noticed that they completely switched out their staff! i used to think that service sucked in terms of waiting time, but now service just sucks period. dont come here if you want to wait over an hour just to get your food. or 30 minutes just to get your $20 bill changed up so that you can tip the waitress. after 30 min, i tipped bare minimum!

20110731 15:40:17 nbsp Went here for the first time ever today only because I had a $15 Groupon for $30 worth of food. Im not a fan of sushi at all, I only go to Japanese restaurants for the sesame chicken, teriyaki chicken, and tempura.

The sesame chicken and teriyaki chicken that we ordered were okay, not bad but not the best Ive ever had (that distinction goes to the nowclosed Davis Osaka Sushi!) After reading all of the recent reviews on here, I was expecting the service to be slow and horrible but it wasnt at all. Upon entering, we were greeted and seated promptly, our orders were taken, the food came out soon after, and our drinks were refilled when needed.

That being said, I probably wont ever return because its a bit pricey and I dont eat sushi. I miss the bento boxes at Osaka Sushi!  Users/pvo

20120121 14:55:50 nbsp I go here a bit because of the bar side... usually a good spot to kick back with a few cheap rolls, some beer and watch the games!  I would like it if they had other dessert (green tea ice cream is good but gets old).  Other ice cream flavors would be good!  Also, what happened to the Korean food that they had a while back?

20120430 10:38:12 nbsp Have tried this place twice now. I am not overwhelmed.  I still prefer Zen Toro and I am happy to pay more for the higher quality.  On the last visit I had to send back my Himachi because it smelled fishy and looked bad (mushy). They did take it off my bill without any problems. Users/LokiAbbi

20120618 16:22:56 nbsp Maybe I am having bad sushi luck in Davis.  Been two Zen Toro twice and definitely was not pleased. Maybe I was harsh on Sushi Unlimited. Users/LokiAbbi

20120622 03:10:47 nbsp I normally have always had good things to say about this place but last night was a different story. I ordered a real crab salad, which Ive ordered at this restaurant before. When my food arrived, I only received 1 ball of crab cut into 4 pieces. Normally, there are suppose to be at least 8 cut up pieces. The crab wasnt freshly made as it was luke warm and the crab on the inside was some what cold. I asked the waitress why there were so few pieces and she went to inquire. She comes back and said the chef told her they only gave me the few pieces because they ran out of real crab... Ok. Running out of crab was not the issues. The issue is that the chef, knowing that they dont have enough crab to make a full order, sent out an incomplete order hoping that the patron isnt the wiser. Why couldnt he just have said they didnt have enough crab in the first place so to give me a choice of something else? Thats what irked me the most...blatantly trying to rip off a customer hoping they dont know the difference. They did eventually make me some fake crab balls but the initial poor decision made by the chef in the back tainted this place for me. Serving mistakes happen but knowingly cheating the customers is another issue all together. Users/C.Ling

20120721 17:22:02 nbsp came in right at opening (11am). great service, nice waitress. HORRIBLE udon. boyfriend called it slimy... and I have to agree. Its very gelatinous compared to the udon were used to. Also, way too much mushroom in the beef udon. Soup tasted... mushroomy... rather than like typical miso/shoyu broth. The #11 lunch bento was pretty good, but like with the beef in the udon, the beef was rough and chewy. cheapass beef...
udon included one naruto fishcake, 2 fried tofu(?) thingers (they were rather smushy and nasty), one boiled egg (noms), thinly sliced green onions, a ton of sliced portabello mushrooms, and a mouthful of nasty, chewy, thinly cut beef pieces. broth, aside from the nastiness of the mushrooms, was rather plain. nothing spectacular. definitely not worth the 13$ we paid for the udon.
bento box included miso soup and a tiny salad loaded with (delicious) honey mustard sauce. nothing particular about these items either. soup tasted like the soup i make myself at home (red miso + tofu + green onions + dashi). also included deep fried gyoza with a meager amount of meat inside, a bunch of fried tempura vegetables (noms) with dipping sauce, a ball of rice, and a handful of edamame (yum).

boyfriend HATED the udon; switched my bento box with him for it. would definitely not suggest anybody get the udon here. much better places for that, esp. for that ridiculous price.

hm... also ordered idr what sushi roll from the half off menu. it was pretty good. not disappointed... but then again, im no sushi expert :p anyhoo, i liked it. good ginger, good wasabi XD both were flavorful; better than some of the others ive tried around davis/sac.

what else... ah. i used the groupon offer here. its NOT good for the 50% off rolls, so keep that in mind if u have one and plan on using it.

ordered a green tea ice cream. very gooey... just like the udon. odd. also had an ice piece inside... makes me suspect that it had melted and refrozen, otherwise sat in the freezer for too long. Large portion though. worth the 2.95$.

i think thats all for now. will post again if i ever eat here again (which is doubtful, considering how mediocre everything was...). Users/KimberlyKitHom

20120721 17:23:39 nbsp oh yeah. the tables are old and wobbly... AC blasting on high... overall, the whole restaurant looked old and rundown. very much in need of a remodeling. outside looks nice though, hah... not a very nice atmosphere, imo. dark, old, and with unstable tables. Users/KimberlyKitHom

20121130 12:00:02 nbsp I go to sushi restaurants for the sushi, not chicken teriyaki.  Ive eaten at Sushi Unlimited many times in recent months. Although service can be slow, the food is worth the wait.  I sit at the bar where service is somewhat under my control.  Their Seafood Salad and Spicy Sashimi Salad are very good, and a great value at only $1011 for a meal sized salad with delicious house made dressings with fresh fish.  The spicy scallop roll is amazing, and the Rocky Roll is my absolute favorite...several varieties of fish, rice, wasabi, and nothing else.  I dont understand all the unfavorable reviews...theyre on my short list of favorites for lunch in Davis.  50% discount menu has less fish in the rolls, but theyre super tasty when my wallet is thin.  Hamachi isnt the best, that would be my only complaint. Users/Linda

20121130 22:29:58 nbsp Im no sushi expert but it was good, and the service was attentive. I commented how I liked the soup and ole boy hooked it up with another bowl on the house. The rolls we had were good. Users/StevenDaubert

20130114 22:42:29 nbsp Had a bento box here.  Service was ok to good. Quality of the food was ok to good.  Pretty pricey.  For $11.95 I got about 23 cubic inches of boolgogi, plus 3 pieces of sashimi which together would barely feed a small cat, plus a lettuce leaf, a small dollop of wasabi, a bowl of poorly dissolved miso and a scoop of rice.  I bet the whole thing added up to about 350 calories. Users/grzyb

20130125 17:08:12 nbsp I very much enjoy this place, and have been coming here for years. Recently, the table side service has been hit or miss. The last time I was there I basically had to coach our server through what my partner and I needed. Chefs are awesome though! Food is yummy and fresh, though I dont like fried rolls or fried things in my sushi, which is most of the rolls :( Would like to see more nonfried options! Users/BombayCollins

20130826 18:16:44 nbsp The price for their unagidon is ridiculous. Moshi Moshi has it for 7 bucks cheaper and I cant imagine their rice or unagi is any better. Both come with soup and salad. Dont get me wrong, Ive been to sushi unlimited and its nice, but dang. I wonder how zen toro compares price wise since Ive heard some claim it to be the best in Davis.
