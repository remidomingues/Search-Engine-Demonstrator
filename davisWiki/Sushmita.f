20100505 07:27:59 nbsp Hey, I deleted the whole mess on Casa de Flores.  If you disagree, you can restore it by clicking Info and reverting back a couple versions... but right now theres an opportunity to start out again with a clean slate.  It seems you have some (ex?) roommate issues that spilled over onto the wiki.  Im sorry about that, but theres not much to do, as this is an open forum.  I thought this might help, considering some of the personal things that were written in public. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
