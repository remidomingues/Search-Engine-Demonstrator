wiki:Sustainability refers to the physical development and institutional operating practices that meet the needs of present users without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs, particularly with regard to use and waste of natural resources. Sustainable practices support ecological, human, and economic health and vitality. Sustainability presumes that resources are finite, and should be used conservatively and wisely with a view to longterm priorities and consequences of the ways in which resources are used.

Sustainability means building something thats good for us now and useful and good for us later.
