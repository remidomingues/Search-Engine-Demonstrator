The Sustainable Living Circus is an occasional collection of evershifting performances put on by a evershifting collection of performers.  The pieces are intended to promote sustainable philosophy and practice through song, dance, juggling, and as many unicycles as can be mustered.

Recent performances have included:
  Atmospheric Ballet  A dance and music piece demonstrating the carbon cycle.
  Wake Up  An interpretive dance about looking beyond daily life and embracing a more holistic way of living.
  The Internudes  In which performers undress (in response to global warming) while performing difficult circus feats.
  In your compost  A compost guide put to music
  Global Warming  A catchy song about rising temperatures and societal indifference
