The Sustainable Research Area (SRA) is located on the west end of the UC Davis campus.  It physically comprises the Student Farm, the EC Garden, Baggins End Innovative Student Housing (the Domes), the Tri Coops or On Campus Coops and Project Compost.  These areas of campus grow organic food for the campus and greater community as well as serve as physical locations for all kinds of social and technological research, experimentation, and development of more sustainable lifestyles. The Students for Sustainable Agriculture aka SSA also meet, work, and play at the SRA.

The SRA needs you and your vision, please come and join in!

The SRA used to be home of the Bike Church, before it was evicted by Student Housing in 2009 and moved to 4th and L St to become the Davis Bike Collective.
