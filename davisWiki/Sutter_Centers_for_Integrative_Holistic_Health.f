20070729 14:58:55 nbsp I found out about the Sutter Center through employees of theDavis Food Coop Coop and went in for an evaluation visit. Dr Cotterel helped me map out several options to further my overall health goals, which I still find useful 3 years later.

It is worth knowing that the initial evaluation visit and even nutrition evaluation visits may be covered by some insurances. Many other therapies, such as massage & herbal remedies, are not. Users/JoRo
