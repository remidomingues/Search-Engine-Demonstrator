20070826 16:47:37 nbsp I loved my experience giving birth here.  I wanted a home birth, but a complicated pregancy prevented it.  I labored in the warm birthing tub, it was so great to be able to move around freely in the water during contractions.  I found most of the staff to be wonderful, though there was one nurse who was a total Nazi to me after I refused to pee in a cup for a drug test. That nurse then put some things on my chart that I later saw and was angry about, but after talkking with the hospital administration, it was straightened out. Theyre cookies are pretty good, and theyll give you as many as you ask for! Users/ElisaWeller

20081031 14:41:34 nbsp Can anyone recommend an OBGYN in Davis?

I currently live in Sacto but am moving to Dixon the middle of November and Im due to have my first child the end of the month in December...so I need to find a Davis OBGYN as soon as possible!

20090302 13:06:23 nbsp Both my girlfriend and I have had bad experiences with Sutter Daviss emergency room staff.
When my girlfriend had a problem with her ears being clogged, the only treatment they could offer was irrigation (spraying water into the ear), which had already been done the same day by the nurse at Cowell Medical, which only hurt her more.
Also, when I was very sick one	evening, I went to the same emergency room.  The night staff was very unprofessional.  One nurse seemed to like squeezing the needle into my arm so hard that the pressure from the liquid made it feel like my veins were going to explode.  I heard her chatting with her supervisor, and apparently from what they said, I was not the first person to be hurt by her.  Rather than reprimanding her, the nurse and her supervisor just had a hearty laugh at my expense and continued squeezing the fluid into my IV at a painfully fast rate.
Maybe these experiences are isolated, but two bad experiences have left me very skeptical about Sutters emergency room.

On the other hand, all other services at Sutter Davis are great.  I was checked into the hospital once last July, and the care I received was superior.  Both my general doctor and my specialist are also very knowledgeable, caring people. Users/hokusman

20090615 18:00:33 nbsp I have fond memories of this place as I delivered here, and the staff aside from the Dr. who delivered my baby was fantastic. The hospital is clean and updated, nice. Love Sutter. Users/JuanaBNDavis

20090911 20:17:47 nbsp Earlier this summer my boyfriend had a seizure, and I was freaking out since this was the first time Ive seen a seizure. A friend drove us to Davis Sutter and the staff were great. They were very nice, caring, and hospitable, and they gave us free Gatorade! They gave the bf an MRI and CAT scan, and we were done in about 8 hours. Go Davis Sutter!  Users/txwong

20091225 16:07:18 nbsp ONE OF THE WORST HOSPITAL I HAVE EVER SEEN. MY GIRLFRIENDS HEAD GOT HIT AND SHE WENT TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM. ALL THEY DID WAS CHECKING HER BLOOD PRESSURE AND ONE DOCTOR CAME OUT AND CHECKED HER. The whole process was not muh longer than five minustes. We have to pay a rip off fee around $700 dollars. We paid the physician fee about 200 dollars first and we applied for the chairity progoram for the remaining hospital fee around 400 dollars. We waited for few weeks for the chairty program results and one day we called them and they said the application is still under reviwing. On the same date. THEY FILED THE RECORDS TO THE COLLECTION AGENCY WITHOUT LETTING US KNOW. They obviously tricked us and this is not nice at all. Users/oyounggo

20100102 18:24:59 nbsp Damn you Sutter, worst Emergency Care and billing style EVER!! Thanks for the 3 hours it took for you to clean out my cut. ( I fell off my bike onto pavement and cut my face) If Id known the bills would be so complicated I wouldve just went to Cowell, I live right behind it for crying out loud. The bills came in twice times!! But I was charged three times. I am so not happy about this right now considering that my insurance company should cover for most of it. I shouldve just given a fake name for all I care at this moment. Id rather die than to go to that hospital ever again. Thanks Sutter. Now I know where the nonprofit part comes into play.

20100103 23:32:54 nbsp Been there twice: Once in 2004 for my husbands emergency appendectomy and once when I had pneumonia in 2006. Both times the staff and doctors were great. But I agree with the problems that people have had with billing. After I was treated for pneumonia I was sent a bill EVERY MONTH! The amount was different every time. After a year long fight with Sutter and my health insurance which was required to cover the cost 100%, Sutter kept reducing the bill which finally went to $55.00, then they sent it to collections.
