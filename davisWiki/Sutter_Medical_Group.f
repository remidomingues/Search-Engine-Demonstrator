Sutter Medical Group (formerly known as Sutter West Medical Group) is a provider of Medical Services medical care offering both primary care and specialty care to the communities they serve. They accept most insurance. Sutter Medical Group is affiliated with Sutter Davis Hospital. Sutter Medical Group has numerous physician office locations in Yolo and Solano Counties, including Davis, Dixon, Winters, and Woodland.

On April 13, 2011, Californias insurance commissioner Dave Jones accused Sutter Health (one of Californias largest health care givers) of fraudulently charging insurers up to hundreds of millions of dollars over the past decade for anesthesia services that in some cases werent even provided. According to http://www.sfgate.com/cgibin/article.cgi?f/c/a/2011/04/14/BAPS1J02L6.DTL an article in the San Francisco Chronicle, Sutter officials say that the organization has yet to see any evidence of fraud or billing improprieties and believe the accusations are without merit.

20110825 14:26:16 nbsp Im really starting to wonder why everyone raves about how good Sutter is and why it does so well in rankings.  Maybe thats just for the hospital?  I have been unimpressed with the level of care that I have received from a variety of doctors, and dealing with the billing department is an absolute nightmare. Users/CovertProfessor

20110913 18:32:54 nbsp Dont go to the Sutter Medical Group on Anderson Road. I went there with a severe cough and vommitting after coughing and the doctor told me I had a lingering cough from a cold. A month later it turned out I had whopping cough and was highly contagious. I also found out later that vommitting after coughing is a main indicator and symptom of whopping cough.  Users/ARL589

20130514 20:45:33 nbsp I would highly recommend Sutters GI department! Users/Babhari
