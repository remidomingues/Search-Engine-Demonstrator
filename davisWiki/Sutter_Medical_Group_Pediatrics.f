20130722 14:28:58 nbsp I took my 3 month old daughter to Sutter West Medical Group pediatrics and Dr. Friends office to get her scheduled immunization.  Sutter (Dr. Friend) failed to combine all of the medications for the multiple component single shot that was intended for my daughter.  They informed me that because they forgot to combine one of the components, that my daughter would need to return to receive the portion that was forgotten so that she would have the full immunization.  They charged me for this return visit that was resulting from their mistake.  I disputed the charge because it was their mistake of not combining all the components in the original shot.  This was the only reason i returned, however they refuse to take responsibility for their mistake and refuse to reverse these charges.  I continue to dispute the charge, and they decided to take it under review.  However, without informing me of any review decision, they send me to collections to force me to pay.  This is a heartless atrocity.  Why should i have to pay for this extra office visit that resulted Dr. Friends staff making a mistake? Users/PaulHrvatin

20131020 16:19:06 nbsp Update:  After a consistent letter writing campaign and dozens of phone calls, Sutter West finally reversed the charges for the debacle below in late August.  However, they failed to notify the collections agency to whom they referred my case that these charges had been dropped.    Here it is, two months later, and I am still being harassed by this collections agency.  Sutters mistake is now affecting my credit rating.  Thanks Sutter West! Users/PaulHrvatin
