Sutter Place was once the name of the culdesac that is home only to Sutter Hospital and Sutter Laser Services.  It was a source of controversy stemming from Californias Gold Rushwiki:WikiPedia:John_Sutter John Sutter, having reportedly killed and/or exploited a large number of Native Americans.

In 1999, UC Davis professor Jack D. Forbes lobbied the City Council to change the name of the street. The council appeared prepared to comply until a public outcry caused them to rethink it. At one point, a man went on a hunger strike to protest the councils refusal to change the name of the street. Nonetheless, no action was taken.  Then when longtime UC Davis Native American Studies professor http://www.dateline.ucdavis.edu/dl_detail.lasso?id8195 David Risling died in 2005, the city council decided it would be a good time to go back and rename the street. It is now David Risling Jr. Court.

The issue managed to be a small story on the national news scene, sort of a Wacky California Hippie newsblurb.




What about renaming it Shasta Place, since it is the continuation of Shasta Drive?
  I believe thats what the proposal was in 1999, actually.
