20051013 17:29:01 nbsp This is a great place.  Many books are absurdly cheap.  Worth a stroll if youve eaten at Osaka Sushi Osaka or just shopped at the Davis Food Coop CoOp Users/MisterProfessor

20051013 19:12:34 nbsp Personally, I think the used books in this store are overpriced. $7 for a beat up paperback is ridiculous.  Users/AnnaJones
                                                 In their defense, the beatup paperback is probably out of print.  The UCD library doesnt even have Rick De Marinis The Burning Women of Far Cry, but for a time you could get it here for 6 or 7 dollars in, admittedly, a beatup paperback.  That seems good to me.

20051013 19:32:38 nbsp I think that Sweet Briars prices are much better than other used bookstores in town. Users/JackHaskel

20060618 13:01:06 nbsp Sweetbriar has a lot of remaindered books too  those are brand new. If you hate to pay full price for a bestseller,  try Sweetbriar. Quite a few music CDs too, and childrens books. Users/ValerieVann

20061015 10:56:42 nbsp Very good art books at excellent prices. Well worth visiting. The owner is great.  Users/PatKahn

20070112 14:38:10 nbsp I used to shop here a lot, but havent gone in a while. I went in today and they were selling stripped books! While I, like many in davis have been known to get books out of the border dumpsters, selling them is a little much?  Users/KevinMurakoshi

20070206 13:15:00 nbsp I think this is one of the best sources of cheap used books in Davis.  I always check here first if Im looking for a novel and their cookbook selection is wonderful.  Ive purchased way too many beautiful cookbooks here that were too cheap to pass up. Users/NaomiVoosen

20070306 00:51:09 nbsp I always enjoy browsing and buying books at Sweet Briar.  It has a small play area where my son always enjoy playing with blocks, puzzles, and dinosaurs.   The prices are very reasonable; there is a wide range of books, including childrens books.  The owner is very nice, accomodating, and knowledgeable.  The quality of the books is great.    Users/KarlaMahoney

20071125 18:36:51 nbsp Helpful employees. Friendly. Always a curious and wonderfully eclectic selection of books both used and new. Just bought a storybook illustrated by Gorey as a birthday present for a friend. Users/EliseKane

20071214 22:37:36 nbsp I agree with Naomi: one of the best cookbook selections around. Always some interesting finds among the art books and the humor section as well. Comfortable layout, interesting inventory, and nice folks. Users/DonShor

20080327 21:57:25 nbsp I love this store...great knitting books at fantastic prices. Youll have money left over for yarn. The best kept secret though is the ballroom dance music. Best prices on CDs and since I teach both subjects...this is the place I send all my students. Users/LizetteHopkins

20080405 18:11:22 nbsp So what are their book buying rules?  Is it a casebycase basis or are there certain qualifications of what is acceptable? Users/SunjeetBaadkar

 Edit: I ended up just calling them and asking.  Its casebycase, but they are currently going to not be buying back books for a while as the person that does that is going to be out of town.

20080508 16:40:37 nbsp I called a nice lady who looked for a few books for me, but, although they were popular titles, they didnt have them in stock. I was disappointed, but nice service Users/AnnaF
 If you are looking for a specific used book you will do better with wiki:WikiPedia:Advanced Book Exchange. I dont usually expect to find a particular book at a used bookstore, especially not one without a computer inventory.  Users/NickSchmalenberger
 Of course, thats the downside of used bookstores.  When something is popular, it is something in demand, and therefore no one sells them back.  If more people would sell back popular things instead of things they (and no one else) wants, then itd be a better system for all. Users/SunjeetBaadkar
 Why not try donating/selling back the more popular books you own, especially if you can go and find them at a library as needed? I try not to buy books unless I really want to give the author a little tangible appreciation for their work. Users/ZacD

20080618 18:59:53 nbsp I love this bookstore!   Given, some sections are lacking, but if you like fiction, it is cheap and abundant.  The way any bookstore should be. Also, if you like cheap cookbooks, this is the place.  Users/HillaryThomas

20080816 13:16:23 nbsp As of August 16th, 2008, still not taking any additional books.  Anyone know of a place that does in town? Users/IDoNotExist

  Currently, no.  There is none in this town.  We also have a lack of places that sell old school, nonchildrens board games.  That is something I hope to rectify though. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

  wiki:sacramento:Beers Book Center Beers Books in Sacramento buys used books. Its a wonderful bookstore with a very large inventory. (12/26/08)  Users/robinlaughlin


20080816 18:58:37 nbsp This bookstores toy area distracts my small children while I shop for books. The owner is helpful when Im trying to find something, but never pushy. If I didnt already have a suprfluity of books at home and the office, I would shop here every week. Its a good place to find third prizes. Users/DrandyJones

20081129 12:44:29 nbsp I would not recommend this store, the books are overpriced and the owner is always rude every time I enter the store and browse.  She is also not welcoming to children either.  This family will not be shopping at Sweet Briar in the future, I am tired of the unfriendly environment and high prices.  Anyone else opening up a used book store in Davis???  it is definitely needed.   Users/heidimermis

  That has not been my experience of this store.  The people have always been friendly and helpful, usually not pushy, and welcoming.  Price is price.  Market conditions drive what they ask and what they will take for books.  If one wants cheaper used books, one may have to open a used bookstore themselves.  Users/Rocksanddirt (11209)

20081211 10:23:47 nbsp Contrary to heidimermis, I have always found the owner (or the woman I believe to be the owner) to be very friendly and helpful. Sweet Briar has a great selection of used books at fair prices and is a comfortable place to browse. And Im glad Davis still has a used bookstore. Users/britti

20090111 21:33:40 nbsp I went for the first time last week to buy a few books for a Jane Austen book club. I was impressed by the quality of the books, and that I purchased 4 books that were new (only one used, and ironically the most expensive  but half price the normal selling price anyway) for only $26. Win! I will definitely come here first for any book needs.  Users/ChristyMarsden

20090421 22:46:24 nbsp I love this store! Their books are generally in quite good shape and they have a vast and varied selection. The clerks have always been very polite as well. Users/CParker

20090421 23:16:36 nbsp some decades back, after being confronted  at ARC by the evangelical soviets, i cast my net for the like i felt. b_o_r_d_e_r_s and b_a_r_n_e_s&n_o_b_l_e have one trash novell about the importance of chaos in a liber education or some such nonsense, to make a long story short , i found the ample trade of books(A.Crowley) insteadof money(credit cards) on the lower shelves near the left rear.

20100115 17:55:17 nbsp pros: great, independent bookstore. Cheap used and  even new  books.
cons: store credit for returns only. if you change your mind about your purchases, your money is stuck here regardless.

if you shop here, be prepared for that as well as staff that is hot and cold. The clerk I dealt with today was inept, and had to make two phone calls to discuss the return policy (which is posted on the register as i later found out) and was unfamiliar with some register operations with the customers ahead of me, which made the wait in line a WAIT. On another occasion, my friend was told to leave because he was wearing cologne. They should have prominent signage for both a) fragrance allergies and b) their return policy.

If you  wear fragrances or like to change your mind about the books you buy, take your business elsewhere.  Users/ns

20100128 13:33:49 nbsp Great books, excellent pricing.  The staff has actually read books!  and they are adults!  If you want to sip coffee and have the clerk compliment you and give you a cookie, this is not the shop for you.  If you like BOOKS, go here. Users/AnnMassey

20110324 17:33:03 nbsp Ive bought many books from here. Its organized well, has fair prices (same as Amazon), and I always find something to read there.  Only wish the older gentleman (the ownerI think) was more friendly.  Hes not very welcoming and I sometimes feel like Im intruding on his quiet time.   Users/YogiJen

20110325 11:26:34 nbsp Hi, I also work at SB Books and Im sorry that you had that experience.  Actually, the owner is a womanshoulder length dark brown hair, around 50.  Please come in during her shifts (currently M, Tu 36 and Th, F and Sa 103).  She is friendly and welcoming.  The owner hires people on the basis of friendliness and book knowledge, and she has always trained her employees to greet each entering customer as well as emphasizing attentiveness.  This is how I was trained.  Im sorry that you did not feel welcome the other day, and I hope that your next visit makes up for it.  :) Users/Pooka

20110527 10:09:48 nbsp Im really pleased with the selection here. The cook book section is expansive, and they have many popular titles in the general fiction and classic lit sections as well. Some of the paperbacks they sell are a little beat up for my tastes, but Im happy that this store allows me to indulge my book obsession while living on a grad student budget. Users/heatherbreen

20111103 19:33:37 nbsp Owner is very rude....IF she looks up, wont say Hi or Can I help you? despite the store being empty.  Overpriced and limited quality selections despite having lots of books there.  Not really sure how this place stays in business.  Can find books much cheaper on the internet or for those hard to find books there are some outstanding used bookstores an hour away in the Bay Area.    Users/stodd84

20111107 08:23:22 nbsp One year ago I tried buying a two editions behind, out of print, never bought or sold book of academic articles on food preservation techniques  $175. Had been on the shelves here for two years. They wouldnt sell it to me for $50, so I never bought it. Gotta keep the titles moving in a book store  as a used book seller, you should get them practically for free, and so should price them to move, at any price. Users/EdwardNiemand

20111107 19:54:11 nbsp Sharon: much grieved by your news.  So sorry to be loosing your great bookstore.  You always had the classics and the not so classic stuff. My daughter, Maya, loved to go and brouse through your kids section as a youngster and now she likes to find her lit. text readings at your great place. I enjoyed emailing you with needs for book club and you responded so quickly  all the time. As I had many art students over the years, you always had gift art books to recommend for me to give them as they graduated.
Thanks for the many hours of service to our community.

Sorry to see you go.  Will miss you.  cc Users/carrieceniseroz

20111109 11:04:33 nbsp Im so sad Sweet Briar is closing. I have purchased some AMAZING books here at AMAZINGLY low prices. I love all the different, unique sections of the store and its sweet, peaceful atmosphere. Im really gonna miss this store. Users/EliseKane

20111128 10:52:41 nbsp Im very sad to hear that Sweet Briar is closing!  I love that place, and Im horrified to think that Davis, a university town, will now be without a single independent book store (correct me if Im wrong!).  It was always such a pleasant place to visit, and I always managed to find interesting and unusual books at good prices.  Sweet Briar, youll be missed! Users/JoeMartin
  There are two remaining independent bookstores: Avid Reader and Logos Books.   Users/CovertProfessor

20111128 10:57:05 nbsp Is the closing sale getting any better? maybe it was just me, but when I went in there last week, the sale prices didnt seem that great... Users/jsbmeb

20120626 14:01:57 nbsp Man, I still miss this place. I had books from Sweet Briar in my house before I even had furniture. Users/LizPhillips
