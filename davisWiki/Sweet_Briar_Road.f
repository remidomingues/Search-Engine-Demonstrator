Address(Sweet Briar Road) is a short street that connects G Street to H Street just south of East 8th Street.

Before East 8th Street was built, Cemetery Road extended from G Street east across the railroad tracks to the Davis Cemetery. Sweet Briar Road and Pennsylvania Place are remnants of Cemetery Road, and the section from J Street to the cemetery is now part of 8th Street. Part of old Cemetery Road can be seen if you walk into the bushes from the corner of Sweet Briar and H Street â€” there is some concrete and a yellow center line on an abandoned piece of street where it once crossed the railroad tracks. 8th Street ended just east of the cemetery until the mid 1990s when it was connected to Tulip Lane.
