20100321 20:21:54 nbsp I found this cute consignment store yesterday and was thrilled! The owners Barb & Alice were very personable and sweet to my twoyearold, the store is decorated with vintage illustrations & umbrellas, theres a kids bookstore in the back, as well as a play area. My son did NOT want to leave! Users/KyanaTaillon

20100727 15:29:38 nbsp This is a great store!! Very easy to shop with kids. Nice BIG selection compared to others in the area.  Very high quality used clothes & gear.  Very nice locally made gifts.  Look for the $2 dollar rack too. Users/LHC

20130316 20:32:37 nbsp Sweet Potato Pie has a new owner who made the shop even more interesting than it already was. The decor is attractive and the store smells nice (you can tell the clothes are washed before being displayed). The prices are very affordable, and the discount bins hold true deals. Bloomers, hats and socks were all under a dollar, and the most expensive item I bought that day was a brand new (label still on) baby Ergo infant insert for just $10 (they retail for $25 +). The owner was also very welcoming and helpful. I will be coming back!  Users/SophiaBrattain
