Sweet and Shavery has joined the recent abundance of dessert restaurants in Davis, but with a distinctive twist: it serves Italian ice, frozen custard (vanilla or chocolate), and street crepes.  You can order Italian ice alone, frozen custard alone, or an ice parfait, which is a mix of frozen custard and your choice of Italian ice.  Italian ice flavors include mango, lemon, lime, strawberry, raspberry, passion fruit, tangerine, pineapple, and more. Most patrons seem to be eating ice parfaits.  There is seating inside, or you can take your treat across the parking lot and sit in the plaza, marveling at those who choose to stand in line at Baskin Robbins instead.

20140408 20:53:12 nbsp The vanilla custard is properly creamy and offers a lovely contrast to smooth and flavorful Italian ice.  A perfect dessert for a warm evening. Users/CovertProfessor

20140527 08:16:55 nbsp Having recently tried S&S I can say it was good. The custard is really rich (usually things arent to rich for my taste) & the ice very flavorful. Lemon & sour apple was the combo I tried. I also sampled the lime which was really good. The crepes looked more than passable I was just meeting the folks to try something shavery...
