Swimming is an excellent full body exercise workout for toning, though some say that its not the best way to lose weight because it makes you hungry afterward. Davis has several pools where you can get in a good swim workout or just splash around with the kids. Some Gyms & Fitness gyms and training programs partner with the City of Davis or private pools to better serve their members. For example, The Davis Aquatic Masters coordinate workouts for adults at city pools, with additional adult practices offered by the Davis Athletic Club,  and the Davis Swim and Fitness Club. The Aquamonsters and the Davis Aquadarts Swim Team Aquadarts age group team also works out at Schaal.  The AquaStarz Synchronized Swimming Team workouts at city pools. There is also the Swim Club at UC Davis for students and faculty.
