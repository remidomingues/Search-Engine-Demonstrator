Locked away behind the blue and white walls of Facebook lies https://www.facebook.com/groups/216897591730862/ a group of students willing to sell their swipes to the Dining Commons for a few meager dollars. Rates are often in flux, but you can count on a plummet as the academic year comes to a close.

Sodexo now limits students to 10 guest swipes per quarter. So long Swipes for Sale.
