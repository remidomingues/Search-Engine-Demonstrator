Swirl Frozen Yogurt is a locally owned restaurants business that serves frozen yogurt with live and active cultures. The yogurt is fatfree and has 25 calories per ounce. With simplicity as Swirls concept, they offer four flavors at a time  original and green tea as a standard, along with mango, pomegranate, and blueberry as specialty flavors on rotation that cost $0.50 extra. According to them, the frozen yogurt is not heattreated and has ten times the amount of live and active cultures needed to be branded active culture yogurt. In a few words, it is what it is, REAL frozen yogurt.

Image(swirldoor.jpg,left,thumbnail,320) Swirl carries four different sizes: child (3 oz., for those under 12), small (5 oz.), medium (8 oz.), and large (12 oz.). They offer over 20 toppings, many of which are fresh fruits or cereals. They also have mochi as a topping after many customer requests. Swirl also sells gift cards in $10 increments.

Those already familiar with frozen yogurt stores such as Pinkberry and Red Mango will feel right at home, as the concept and tart flavor are the same. For those unfamiliar with the concept, Swirl employees are always offering samples. New specialty flavors are in the works, which would also rotate between the mango, blueberry, and pomegranate flavors.

20071022 14:28:51 nbsp For those of you from Southern California craving Pinkberry up here, theres finally a Davis version. Its a bit creamier, with more of a yogurt taste than Pinkberry, but I suppose thats because Swirl uses actual yogurt as opposed to powdered stuff. Its just as yummy as Pinkberry though. My only complaint is no mochi balls, but hopefully they will have those soon.  Users/DannyYu

20071023 22:25:28 nbsp Id been craving Pinkberry ever since my frequent trips to LA this summer and Im so glad Swirl is open. Its delicious and even healthier than Pinkberry. (Did you know Pinkberry doesnt have the ingredients to be considered real yogurt?!) Im sure Im not the only one that was waiting for more places like this to open in Norcal and of all places, Davis. Arent we lucky! Sure, there are no mochi balls but the owner says they will be getting those asap. Go to Swirl!! You wont be disappointed! Users/mytastesaresupreme

20071025 19:15:33 nbsp I love the frozen yogurt here. It has a refreshing taste that isnt covered up with tons of sugar. Great fruit variety for toppings.  Users/SanaaJarrahian

20071025 19:59:50 nbsp pretty good stuff, I dont know what punkberry tho Users/AlexJohnson

20071026 22:23:29 nbsp This place is very good. The tartness of the yogurt is downright addictive, and the fruit toppings are varied and fresh. I would imagine that it is rather lowcal, but I didnt see any info about this on the website or in the store. Its great to have a place to get a nice treat that isnt sugar laden and artificial.  Users/MarieBoisvert
 To answer your question, the yogurts are 25 calories per ounce, nonfat with no added sugar (meaning that it only contains the natural sugar sucrose.)  Users/Kafani
 We have remedied the lack of nutritional information by posting that, as well as a list of ingredients used in the yogurt, next to the cash register in the store. There is sugar (not to be confused with sugarfree yogurts and ice creams which use Splenda and such), but the main sweetener source is sucrose, not high fructose corn syrup. The sugar count is 14 g per 4 oz. serving. Users/ScarlettYing

20071027 03:18:25 nbsp I know the owner of this place. He is a good guy eager to give his customers great value & a treat that the whole family can enjoy. It is the healthy alternative to ice cream. Much better than fakeberry. If you have special requests for topping just ask Ross, he will accomidate you. He is always open to new ideas that will satisfy his friends & loyal customers.   Users/TheBigJuice

20071027 15:48:48 nbsp Yummy!  Users/LadyBeltane

20071028 10:50:21 nbsp We went yesterday for the first time and it is definately our new favorite place to go for a snack or dessert.  The girl behind the counter was super nice and helpful giving us samples and patience as we considered all our options.  The only negitive we both had was that we wished the blueberries had been fresh rather than frozen but they have many other fruits that are fresh. Users/jess&will

20071028 16:47:00 nbsp yum yum yum yum yum...green tea with granola and carob chips is simply yum. Users/JillWeinstein

20071030 22:23:04 nbsp Great place! The frozen yogurt actually tastes like yogurt! Strange but delicious. I think the subtitle should be LIVE FROZEN YOGURT or REAL FROZEN YOGURT to differentiate it from the other places that are selling artificial hack jobs and calling it frozen yogurt. Users/DoctorJones

20071101 10:02:52 nbsp I went twice this week.  The yogurt was great but the fruit was not. The  first time I had blueberries, strawberries and mango.  Ive never had such bad blueberries.  Since I like the yogurt I went back and only had strawberries and mango, forgoing a third topping since there wasnt another fruit that looked good.  this time the mango was not good.  Quite underripe. I dont know if Ill go back since I like my yogurt with fruit or mochi topping. Users/robertaB

20071104 16:58:08 nbsp I went to Swirl today and got an original large with strawberries, kiwi, and coco pebbles. The yogurt is pretty good, a bit creamier and more tart than pinkberry. the fruit wasnt fresh, it was frozen and also pretty tart. they definitely dont offer more than 20 toppings, well at least not at one time, and unless all the choices were not set out. The inside decor is also a bit lacking, just lots of neon green and orange. overall, not bad, but pinkberry is definitely better despite the fact/rumor that pinkberry yogurt is made from powder. however i do think, swirl is better than yogurt shack.  Users/AmyYang
 Not all of their fruits are frozen. They might be a little hard and cold because their are set on a counter that blows cold air from underneath. When Swirl first opened, all of the berries were fresh. But now, since prices have risen, some of the berries are come frozen due to the fact that they are out of season and fresh ones are very costly. So you can definitely count on Ross for getting quality ingredients when feasible (costwise). Users/mytastesaresupreme

20071105 17:21:57 nbsp Took the family here a couple of days after they opened. Suprisingly, my kids loved it. Ross was great, and very patient with my kids topping choices. We will definetly go back. I would like to see a little more in the lobby area, maybe a flyer/message board or something just to break up the starkness. They might be getting a mobile version this spring to take to the farmers market. Cant wait. Users/Aaron.Curtin

20071106 14:53:44 nbsp Just went there today for an afterlunch treat.  Its wonderful.  It actually tastes like yogurt.  As opposed to yogurt masquerading as ice cream, which can also be good (i.e., Golden Spoon!), but is not particularly good for you.  All the fruit options I saw were fresh, so perhaps this has changed since the first reviews were posted.  Try Green Tea with kiwi! Im pretty sure I wont be ordering dessert with lunch or dinner in downtown for a long time now, as Ill just want to stop off at Swirl afterward!     Users/CynthiaCCC

20071108 10:09:44 nbsp The yogurt is pretty good but the toppings are sooooo expensive. 80 cents for 4 small pieces of kiwi? at least pinkberry has a cuter interior and is a little more generous when it comes to toppings.  Users/WhenLostLookUp

20071108 18:03:50 nbsp To add on to my previous review, I was at Swirl yesterday and they had just added mochi to their toppings. Their mochi is awesome  better than Pinkberrys, and Im addicted to Pinkberry with mochi. The orange coloring made it look like dried papaya, so you might not recognize it at first, but if you ask someone will point it out for you. Users/DannyYu

20071109 20:33:56 nbsp Swirl definitely seems like the place for people who are more serious about their yogurt, as compared to Yogurt Shack. That person isnt me, but I can see why some would prefer it.  It has more of a yogurty flavor (a bit more sour) and there is more of an emphasis on healthy toppings  but just as the Shack has a few fruit toppings, Swirl has a few lesshealthy toppings, too (I think there were M & Ms?).  I tried the specialty pomegranate flavor (50 cents extra, as noted above).  Again, I am not gaga over frozen yogurt, but it had a nice pomegranate flavor and I vastly preferred it to my partners green tea flavor, even though I usually love green tea ice cream.  I agree with others who say that the toppings are expensive  80 cents for the first topping, 40 cents for the second, regardless of the size of your cup, and the amount of toppings I received was not a lot for that price.  But the raspberries were fresh and quite good, especially considering the time of year. Users/CovertProfessor

20071109 20:42:13 nbsp Stopped by to give it a try today.  After the second bite (honestly, I almost chucked it in the trash after the first) I really developed a taste for it.  Had the origional and I will be going back.  Think of it as tart and yogurty (not ice cream!) and itll most likely hook you. Users/Davidlm

20071110 14:23:58 nbsp Swirl > Yogurt Shack

20071114 09:06:21 nbsp They must have forgotten to include crack cocaine in the list of ingredients.  It has to be in there though.  I was just now thinking of the next crime I will have to commit in order to finance my habit.

20071118 16:38:28 nbsp the first time i tried this yogurt i didnt hate it but i didnt love it.  strangely, since then i find myself craving swirl almost everyday. i think it is a great healthy alternative to regular frozen yogurt. Users/Chantal

20071118 22:16:57 nbsp Enjoyed the original flavor special (three toppings).  Had the raspberries, kiwi, and mochi  it was pretty good.  I really liked the flavor, plain and simple.  Sampled the pomegranate flavor yogurt, but unfortunately neither my girlfriend or I were impressed with it.   Users/EdWins

20071121 13:34:55 nbsp I went there on a Friday night at about 8:30ish. The service was great, the girl at the counter was nice and friendly. I ordered something along the lines of Carob, Strawberry, Raspberry and was satisfied with it. Users/DavidHolcomb

20071129 17:15:41 nbsp love it. Im not much of a dessert person, but this stuff is awesome. Oddly if you get 1 topping you get the same amount of topping as when you order 2 or 3. I personally like to go green with a green tea kiwi combination. Users/MattHh

20080122 18:41:21 nbsp So I have been going to Swirl since they opened and I am ADDICTED!  I have cravings for it ALL the time.  My husband I just had our first baby and we are a little tight on money so we decided that we needed to make a budget.  Even though we are tight on money I just HAD TO budget for Swirl.  I seriously added a line item to our budget so that I could have Swirl once a week. I cut all other extra spending but I couldnt cut out swirl. It is so dang good!  My favorite: Large Original with Strawberries, Blueberries and Kiwi.  YUMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!!! Users/MsSteffee

20080212 21:48:37 nbsp OK...where do I begin. My first Swirl experience was back in October....and since then I go at least 3 times a week....(lots of swirl card punches) I tried pink berry down south after trying swirl and its just not the same or as good in my opinion. SWIRL is so AMAZING. I cant even begin to like describe its......and it has live cultures!!!! :) Mango with blackberries and blueberries and more mangos!. MMMMMMMMMMMM Yog Shack has nothing on SWIRL Users/philip

20080213 00:37:58 nbsp hmmmm well, i think i like swirl only by default since that other yogurt place sucks big ones. i personally like the yogurt joints in socal much more though (e.g. pinkberry in LA and peachhouse in alhambra/san gabriel). the yogurt at swirl melts too quickly; maybe cuz theres too much ice? i cant really complain because davis doesnt leave me with many choices. so kudos to you owners of swirl. you wont be going out of business anytime soon since frozen yogurt is the new fad nowadays hahahaha. Users/echelon

20080217 21:19:00 nbsp Swirl is so much better than Yogurtshack. This is ACTUAL frozen yogurt, not that crappy softserve ice cream pretending to be yogurt. Users/FeliciaTing

20080301 23:45:39 nbsp Swirl is absolutely delicious.  The only thing I didnt like was the service I received today versus the other two times earlier this month: while my boyfriend and I received a pretty generous portion of yogurt the last two times, the girl today only filled our cups a little over halfway full.  I was a little disappointed, given we were paying at least $4 each for a small cup and a topping or two and barely got any yogurt (even though we had generous helpings the other two times), while the customers in front of us were served generous helpings.

At the very least I hope Swirl takes the time to teach their employees about portion control and customer service, because not only did the server today skimp out on the yogurt but she was pretty disgruntled as well, and it kind of makes Swirl as a whole look bad in my eyes.  I would hate to try and avoid a place simply because I dont like one of the servers. Users/wootywoo

20080302 00:27:49 nbsp I absolutely love this place. I had never had frozen yogurt before and I have to say that I am very pleased. My favorite is  mango with strawberries and kiwi. I see myself going here a lot over the summer. Great place, highly recommended!  Users/BrandonBarrette

20080310 16:24:20 nbsp I love swirl, it is perfect for spring! Users/hmm

20080313 13:06:20 nbsp I never thought Id like a yogurt joint, but Swirl is addictive. The taste of their yogurt is just rightno artificial sweetness and a nice sour from the cultures. The toppings (for the most part) are healthy and minimalist (in a good way), and the standard practice seems to promote ample toppings, suggesting to me that that the owner is more concerned about the quality of the Swirl experience than saving a few bucks from excessive efficiency. I do have a few complaints, however: one is that theres some serious wiki:WikiPedia Volatile_Organic_Compounds VOC offgassing going on inside, emitted either by the big undulating plastic panel (my guess) or the paint. So in the process of getting a healthy alternative to ice cream, you have to smoke the equivalent of a few cigarettes, especially when there are long lines (which is most of the time). There should be an ordinance against materials that offgas, because the impact on the customers and employees is only slightly less harmful than secondhand smoke, a wiki:WikiPedia Carcinogen#IARC_classification_of_carcinogens class one carcinogen. Second, why not use fairtrade/organic yogurt and toppings? Its nigh time businesses get on board with the organic, ethical farming movement! Oh, and one last thing: bring back the blackberries! ;) Users/ZacharyNorwood ZN
 Thanks for your compliments and concerns! Were glad you enjoy our yogurt. As an employee of Swirl, I can attest to the fact that the owner put great care into painting our interior with VOCfree paints. Im not quite sure what you mean by undulating plastic panel, Im assuming youre talking about the wall with the swirly, yogurty design. I dont believe its made of plastic, as its painted with the same VOCfree paints that was used on the other white walls of the store. That being said, we will definitely look into the cause of the VOC offgassing smell you pointed out. My first guess would be from us cleaning and sterilizing pretty much every surface of the store on a regular basis, especially the tables. As for the fairtrade and organic yogurts and toppings, we have looked into everything from organic fruit (which we have every so often, depending on our fruit shipment, its just not labeled outside as such) to compostable spoons, cups, etc. We would love to be a green company! But as an upstart business venture (Swirl is not yet part of a chain or franchise, the owner is a Davis resident!) that just came to fruition this October, we do not yet have the means or patrons to be a green company costeffectively and still maintain the same prices for the consumer. However, as Swirl is still a growing business, we will hopefully be able to go green and organic in the future. And dont fret, the blackberries will be back as soon as they are more in season! :) Thanks for choosing Swirl Frozen Yogurt!  Users/ScarlettYing
   Thanks for responding. Hrm. Is it possible that Im confusing the natural smell of yogurt cultures with plastic offgassing? I did consider this possibility, initially, but gave up on it after repeat visits. Im very sensitive to the distinct, VOC smell, because Ive had a few bad experiences with it. Maybe new paint, even if VOCfree, smells the same as VOC emitting paint. Either way, Im open to being corrected. Ill have to suspend judgement. Im glad to know, at least, that what Im detecting doesnt come from the paint. (I thought the white, undulating decoration thingy was plasticguess not. Good to know.) Ill keep an eye out for organic/fairtrade/green offerings, and Im glad its already under consideration for a later date. I know Ill (and my friends) will make the switch, even if theres a price hike, and from the looks of things, I think Swirl will be in a position to experiment sometime soon :) Good business model. Users/ZacharyNorwood ZN

20080321 14:46:01 nbsp I just completed a review of Swirl describing my familys first experience there.  We absolutely love this place! Feel free to read and comment. I hope it encourages more people to eat dessert here so they can have this instead of Cold Stone.

20080327 13:35:12 nbsp I absolutely love this place.  Its incredibly pricey, and Ive had to argue with my husband to put Swirl into our budget... but its worth it.  My only complaint is that they dont have large enough containers!  I live in Sacramento and work in Davis, and I would love to be able to buy a pint or gallon of this stuff and keep it in my freezer at home so that I can enjoy Swirl at any time.  Im sure they would make a killing if they made something like that available. Users/HeidiDris

 this might be tough considering the stuff melts so fast. Once it melts it usually isnt that good when stored in the freezer. But if this could work, I agree it would be excellent. Users/MattHh

20080329 20:37:20 nbsp Has anyone else had unauthorized charges on their credit/debit card from Swirl lately?  One just showed up on my account from yesterday, and I havent been to Swirl in two weeks.  All the other times that Ive gone to Swirl and paid debit card were cleared, so Im wondering if this happened to anyone else.  So far my friend and boyfriend have similar charges on their cards.... Users/wootywoo

I just want to say that we are aware of the problem and that it has already been corrected. The issue had nothing to do with anything that we had done and did not even show up on our credit card close out report. It had to do with a coding error in the Global Pay System( whatever that means) Any card that was charged has been refunded and will appear on your statement within a few days. I am very sorry for any worry that this may have caused anyone and hope you realize that I was very distraught as well since I am the owner of Swirl and value each person as a customer. This apparently happened to many businesses and since I dont want to take another chance I am changing credit card companies.

20080406 01:36:00 nbsp I enjoy the green tea frozen yogurt with the mochi topping. It was my first time trying green tea flavored anything, and I must admit that I thought the initial taste was strange. But after a few spoonfuls you get used to it and it just becomes delicious! The mochi topping has an interesting texture. Users/at86

20080406 08:36:15 nbsp At other places where Ive tried frozen yogurt, the yogurt tasted just like ice cream.  This is definitely different.  The green tea yogurt tastes somewhat bitter (but not all that much like green tea).  The plain tastes, well, like plain yogurt!  The mango tastes a lot like mangos (although still somewhat different), and is pretty good plain.  They have lots of interesting toppings.

As for the marketing claim about the vast quantities of live and active cultures: is this actually a benefit?  Im not a bio expert, but I would think that you would just digest the cultures when you eat them.  (Bio people, comments?)  If that is the case, then consuming yogurt with lots of active cultures doesnt do anything for you.  But lets say that that is not the case, and you retain some of these cultures (in your intestines, for example).  If you do not already have the proper amounts of whatever is in the yogurt in your system, you are probably walking around very sick because you are missing something essential from your system.  If you do, increasing the amount by 10 times is probably not beneficial, and could be quite harmful!  (No, I dont think that anyone is being harmed by the yogurt!  But would you take 10 times the required dose of something that you needed?  In many cases, that could make you quite sick as well.)  My (uninformed as a nonbio person) guess is that you simply digest the cultures, and it makes absolutely no difference how active culture filled the yogurt is.  But the point is, its a bit like saying that other cars are blue, but mine is even more blue, so you should buy mine instead!  Swirl is essentially saying that their yogurt is even more like active culture yogurt than other active culture yogurts, which are only active culture yogurt!  Its still active culture yogurt.  So where is the benefit to making it even more active culturelike? Users/IDoNotExist

Bacteria, especially acidophiles/acid lovers (which are the bacteria used in yogurts and other dairy products) are not necessarily digested when you eat them. Food borne infections are caused this way, when you consume such a large number of harmful bacteria that they make you sick (usually between 10 million to 1 billion cells). Also, acidophiles also produce an acid environment around them (in your intestinal tract) with the byproducts of the sugars that they digest, such as lactose. This helps to inhibit  the growth of other, possibly harmful bacteria (which is why your stomach is also a very acid environment). The concept of dosage is also not applicable to a label like contains live and active cultures  bacteria are not the same thing as medicines or vitamins. Users/distracted

  What the hell is MO CHEESE? I hope this post is a joke, and if so lets take the comment about a staff member being ignorant out of here. You sound like an ass. Users/davistudent
    You appear to be very sensitive about your unfamiliarity with Swirls Mo Cheese topping, and hastily assume my feedback of the store was a joke. Please look into the matter the next time youre at their store instead of calling a fellow community member an ass. Also, I dont recall labeling a Swirl employee ignorant, which highlights my evaluation of the Swirl staff as literate because evidently not all of us are. I appreciate your assertiveness to this matter, and I forgive your cowardliness, Miss Anonymous. Users/RichardTrendall
      Im gonna side with Users/davistudent on this. ignorantly is harsh. Misheard is more appropriate, considering the two do look and sound very familiar.  Not to mention, Im sure that theyd have corrected the mistake once you pointed it out. Your replies reek of passive aggressiveness as well, by the way. Users/StewartShearer
Youre correct. The staff member who misheard my order chose to correct it, but in an untimely and unacceptable fashion. Since it was packed in the store (the line was out the door), the worker told the cashier what happened and reprinted an order/receipt and placed it down on the counter behind four or five other tags. I chose not to wait in line (again) and fueled my previous review with unnecessary harshness, and I apologize for that. In response to your discovery of my passive aggression, if youd like to share any more irrelevant thoughts on the issue at hand, please feel free to message me. Users/RichardTrendall

20080818 19:53:01 nbsp Not too happy with them... I went in yesterday to get some yogurt for my kids only to be told that I couldnt get kid sizes without my kids.  Hello... it was a surprise!!!  Then after explaining the situation, they still insisted I get the larger size (extra $$$).  When I asked for 2 green teas, they said they were out.  My kids dont like the plain flavor so I was forced to get one of the specialty flavors (extra $$$).  I asked since they were out of the flavor I wanted, were they still going to charge me the extra $$$ for the mango flavor, and guess what... they did.  As I was paying, he shorted me my correct change, and looked irritated when I pointed it out.  As we were leaving, he told the girl he was working with that I didnt even tip after everything he had to do for me.  What a @#$% up ending to a good day. Users/Aaron.Curtin
