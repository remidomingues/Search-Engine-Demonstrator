Switchboard was a volunteerrun questionanswering service.  Everything from events board Whats happening in town tonight? to Where is the nearest bus bus stop? to Who can I talk to about questions this problem? to How do you make eggnog?.  Folks gathered up copies of newspapers, telephone numbers phone directories, bus schedules, various reference books, and notes about local events; signed up to work various shifts (mostly open in the evening/night and tried to help whoever called.  We referred many callers to the Library Reference Desk, The House, various tutors, and other help services.

Switchboard used phones and office space provided by the University.  Eventually ASUCD failed to renew the request for these resources, and Switchboard lost its home.
