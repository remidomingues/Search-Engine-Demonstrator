 Overview 

Sword and Sandals (http://calaggie.org website) is a Campus campus interest group that was founded in December of 1921 as a secret society.  Based off of UC Berkeleys http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~ogb/ Order of the Golden Bear, it serves as a place where prominent individuals on campus can come together to engage in frank discourse without their titles holding them back.  While the organization is no longer a secret society, it was for most of its history.  The membership of Sword and Sandals is made up of many undergraduate students, various graduate students, as well as alumni.  Because members are selected based upon their leadership abilities, many of the University elite are or once were members  e.g. Past Chancellors, highranking members of ASUCD, as well heads of other campus organizations.  Sword and Sandals meets every so often on campus to discuss topics relevant to the University.  The organization maintains that it never takes action, does not vote on issues, but rather serves as a ground for frank and open discussion.  The membership is encouraged to come learn about and debate issues, and to use the information they hear at meetings as they see fit in their everyday lives.

Very much like the wiki:wikipedia:Skull and Bones Skull and Bones at Yale University, the Sword and Sandals keeps the proceedings of its meetings secret and is used by members to interact and discuss issues.  Several exposes published in the The California Aggie (the most recent are in 1993 and 2005), as well as this wiki page, have diminished the secrecy of the organization. The group still exists today, but the effectiveness of the organization has been questioned.  Apparently, its also a 501(c)3 organization.

    Coincidentally many influential people in Swords and Sandals are also members of a Facebook group called http://ucdavis.facebook.com/group_profile.php?gid10119 Students for a Better Davis, a group supporting Ruth Asmundsons reelection campaign. Since Saylor spoke with the group it can be assumed that Asmundson did as well, but given her familys history it may also be a good assumption to say that she, or at least her husband, is also a member.

The organizations name comes from the Story of wiki:wikipedia:Theseus.  Theseuss father left the young boy a sword and pair of sandals under a boulder.  When he was big enough to move the rock and recover these items he would be able to claim his birthright to his father.

Note from author: The dirt ritual is questionable, as older members (50 to 60 years old) recently said they werent aware of it.  Younger members say the rituals are constantly changing, but whether the dirt ritual is true has yet to be confirmed.

Theres a great article on S&S in the December 6, 1926 issue of the Aggie Spoof Edition Dingleberry, entitled Political Org. Grabs Jobs and Runs Campus.  The Aggie seemed to be of the opinion that S&S didnt lead to quality representation in the student government.

 The Cabin 
  Directions to the Cabin: Take Highway 50 east to Kyburz. Approximately 1.75 miles east of Kyburz is the Eagle Rock Picnic Area with a large turnout and National Forest sign. At the eastern end of the turnout, on the northside of the highway, is a dirt road leading to the cabin. Either park your vehicle at the turnout or, if you have 4wd drive up the narrow section of the road and park just below the steep section of road. The road to the cabin is part of the old Lincoln Highway.
  The cabin is owned and operated by Sword and Sandals associates or alumni members. The associates are in charge of paying the insurance, electricity, gas, taxes, and permits. The idea of a cabin for Sword and Sandals outings was promoted by Woody Wilson and Ira Smith, who had cabins along the American river. The cabin was built in the early 1930s and enlarged in the 1940s. Former UC President Robert Gordon Sproul was a regular attendee. Sproul was made an honorary member in 1921.

Organization
  The council is made up of five student members and they meet between meetings to plan the agenda and events. Council officers are elected by the student membership. Positions include:
   Worthy Ruler (President)
   Chamberlain (Vice President)
   Scribe (Secretary)
   Bard (Historian)
   Keeper of the Sword (Social director)
  Committee of Nine is made of nine alumni members or associates and are chosen by associate members to act in an advisory capacity to the Council and to oversee the financial affair of Sword and Sandals. The committee meets at least quarterly. Positions include:
   Committee Chair
   Secretary/Treasurer
   Liaison to Associates
   Liaison to Students
   Cabin Master
   Four general members.
The Worthy Ruler is expected to attend the Committee meetings.

Membership
  According to Bob Ball, Everyone who had a building named for him on campus has been a member except oneEd Roesslerwhich was an oversight. This is wrong, as easily demonstrated by King Hall. Wright Hall and Everson Hall are probably additional counterexamples to this claim because they were named before women were admitted to the order, although Wright was alive when women were admitted and could have conceivably joined. She would have been really old, though.
  There are two classes of membership: student and associate. Student membership applies to all those who are enrolled as undergraduate and graduate students. Associate membership applies to alumni, faculty, and staff. Once an undergraduate or graduate is no longer registered they automatically become associate members.
  Two members are required to nominate a person for membership. Nominations should be made by the second to last meeting prior to election. Elections for new members are held in the fall and winter quarters. Candidates for membership need a 2/3 favorable vote of those present at the meeting. Officer elections are held in the spring.
  There are no dues for student members, although associates are asked to donate $5 a year.

The above names were compiled primarily from the 1922, 1928, and 1929 editions of El Rodeo.  These older editions featured a page on Sword and Sandals, listing them as an Honorary Fraternity or as the Order of Sword and Sandals.  On the page was a list of active members, present faculty and honorary members (previously students).

Former ASUCD President/Davis Mayor Bob Black was also a member.  However, when he and two other students were taken out in the middle of the night and asked to undress, out in a barn near Dixon, they rebelled against the hazing and refused to participate.  No, this is stupid, he refused.  They were enrolled as members anyway.

Also seen is the Orders logo:  A sword stuck into a stone that reads, in Greek, Arthurius.  The logo is a reference to the lengendary wiki:WikiPedia:King_arthur King Arthur and the wiki:WikiPedia:The_Sword_in_the_Stone Sword in the Stone story.  In the story, a young boy is intrigued by a mystical sword stuck in stone, which it is foretold that only the next King of England will be able to remove.  An older and wiser magician named Merlyn guides the young boy throughout, and the story ends with the boy removing the sword himself  confirming that he was the King all along.

In the Order of Sword and Sandals, faculty and alumni participation tremendious. There are perhaps parallels between the relationship Merlyn has with the young boy in T. H. Whites __The Sword in the Stone__ and the interactions older members of the Order of Sword and Sandals attempt to have with the younger members.

 An actual meeting 
On Saturday, January 29th, 2005 Sword and Sandals held their yearly Winter Banquet on campus in the MUII.  While many of us left our cameras at home, we were lucky enough to have some Davis Wiki users come to photograph through the windows of this secret event. 

 Before the meeting began 


The following photographs and text is taken from a purely outsiders standpoint, as the photographers never entered the meeting.

The organization reserved MU II, Smith Room, Garrison Room, and the Fielder Room. The main meeting took place in MU II, and the other rooms were used for catering or smaller meetings.

While MU II is hardly secluded, this was, after all, a Saturday night  practically no one was on Campus and the likelihood of someone stumbling by the meeting while it was in progress was minimal.  Of particular note is how well dressed everyone was.  The student members were wearing suits or nice dress clothes.  The ASUCD officials were dressed much better than they usually are for ASUCD Senate Senate meetings.


 The meeting 
The bulk of the meeting seemed to consist of gathering around tables and talking.  Kalen Gallagher (ASUCD President, Student Focus) was one of the first students to show up.  There was a small podium set up, along with a laptop connected to a projector. Image(IMG_1245.jpg, Several unidentified individuals can be seen, as well as the laptop and projector, thumbnail)  Image(IMG_1270.jpg, Everyone chatting and dining.  Kalen Gallagher, Chris Ryan (Sigma Phi Epsilon), as well as others can be seen., thumbnail)

 The Garrison Room 

Perhaps the most mysterious of events unfolded in the Garrison Room, adjacent to MU II.  Kalen Gallagher and a number of other unidentified individuals headed into the room after the meeting in the main room had began.  First the lights appeared to be on, then they turned off and strange music was heard from within the room (note:  not sure if the music was coming from the main room or this room in particular).  Afterward the photo to the right was taken.


After leaving the Garrison Room, a number of items were left behind.  Three brown bags, three packets of soil, and a number of candies and coins were left there.  The bags looked to be originally taped together, and it is likely the items came from the bags.

It is possible that the reading that took place, the music, and the brown bags filled with strange items was some sort of ritual.  After all, there were three people sitting in front of the bags in the first Garrison Room photograph (above right).


 A room gone dark 

Suddenly, after the meeting in the main room had been underway for a while, the lights went off.  It was then noticed that candles were lit!  The room stayed candlelit for 1015 minutes.  The candles, along with the mystery of the Garrison Room, helped reinforce that while this organization has lost much of its secrecy in recent years, it is still filled with tradition and is alive to this very day.


After the lights came back on, their meeting proceeded as before  much chatting, and socializing. At this point one of our photographers was then asked by a member (who was on his cell phone outside at the time) What are you taking pictures of?  This, along with the general lack of activity inside the meeting and the fact the photographers had prior commitments caused us to take off at this point.


SS is an insult to student officials who have been elected by the students to represent them. It is also an insult to hired and appointed student leaders and faculty who go through a rigorous hiring process to be able to work on behalf of the students. Instead of bringing ideas or starting dialogues with the elected and hired student leaders, SS instead selects certain students to have these important discussions. James Schwab, 7/30/07, http://allthingsgreatsmall.blogspot.com/2007/07/ofswordandsandals.html Schwabs Public Blog

As an alumnus member of SS, I have to say that I understand why the natural response might be to distrust and reject something that looks like this on the outside, such fears are unnecessary.  To characterize the meetings of SS as important discussions is inaccurate.  The meetings are an attempt to expand understanding of issues through hearing varied viewpoints from a number of individuals.  It is an exercise of learning and discovery  not a process of discussion, negotiation, or decision.  The group as a whole has no, and tries to gather no collective power or interest, they are united only by a desire to make UC Davis the best university it can be.

The reason for selectivity in my opinion is simple: people are invited who have proven their commitment to the university and whose opinions are deemed valuable to the order.  People who have attained positions of service for reasons of personal power, or people who are deemed to be untrustworthy or overly combative are simply not invited.  It is the right of the members of the order to seek out and accept members based on character and merit.  The biggest problem is that a lot of very well qualified student leaders go unnoticed that indeed should be invited  but are not.   Tim Keller 3/9/08

Years ago in the 1990 era the students overtook Freeborn Hall in protest of the Regents increase in student fees above legal limit.  What is interesting is 1) Freeborn Hall is always booked...except for that weekend  2)All the students that were leaders of the protest were S&S members.  3)The reason Gov. Pete Wilson did not give more money to the University is that the president of the university had a higher pay than him, and the presidents secretary also got paid more than the him.  4) I was arrested on the Quad for telling where the registry for S&S is located.
