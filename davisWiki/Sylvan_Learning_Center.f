Sylvan offered personal tutoring for students preK12 in Beginning Reading, Academic Reading, Sylvan Math Essentials, Academic Writing, Sylvan Study Skills and test prep, either in person or online. They offer test preparation services for the ACT, SAT, and state standardized tests. Before Sylvan begins tutoring sessions, they administer a Sylvan Skills Assessment, which aims to identify a childs strengths and weaknesses. Using the results from this assessment, they develop a personalized tutoring program. Parents are kept in the loop through frequent progress conferences. All Sylvan instructors are certified teachers.

This Sylvan location closed on 10/17/2009.  Right across the parking lot, you can get excellent tutoring at Partners in Learning (530) 7539127.

On November 2, 2009, Sylvans former director, Gayna Guidici, opened the Davis Learning Center in order to continue helping students kindergarten through 12th grade with academic support. For more information, call (530) 2044031 or visit their website at http://www.davislearningcenter.net.

20080225 12:23:30 nbsp HORRIBLE company to work for! Users/JeffPitel
 could you please elaborate. I would guess that many tutors that graduate from Davis consider working there so it would be great if you could warn us as to why its a bad place to work. Thanks Users/MattHh

20080225 21:34:03 nbsp What do they mean by certified teachers, because i know of a tutor there that does not have a teaching credential. Maybe they mean certified through their own training program. I know that they do have to have a bachelors degree though. Users/MattHh

20080527 16:28:49 nbsp Sylvans requirements for instructors vary based on what you want to teach. Math specialists require a secondary degree in math or a related field (e.g. Econ). Anyone teaching reading, writing etc must have a credential through the state of CA. A substitute teaching credential does count! Sylvan also employs teacher assistants who do not have to have a secondary degree.

Jeff  did you work at the Sylvan in Davis? Things vary quite a bit center by center depending on management! I will admit Im biased, but Ive held several positions at Sylvan in Davis and enjoyed them all :) Users/SaraGoldband

20080528 09:52:49 nbsp I have had a wonderful experience with Sylvan.  It is a fun parttime job.  The center staff is wonderful.  They are smart, friendly, and a lot of fun.  The kids are great.  I know each one of them both educationally and personally.  In a 3:1 teaching ratio, they make incredible progress in a short time.  In the high school classroom, if I and the kids work hard, I can skip them up 34 grade levels by the end of the year.  At Sylvan, they can grow one grade level per month.  If my kids were behind or needed enrichment, I would not hesitate to send them to Sylvan.

Regarding teacher qualifications, every teacher we have is both qualified and trained.  To work here, you must have a valid credential (multiple subject (K8th), single subject (7thcollege), or substitute (K12th).  To get any of these credentials, one has to graduate from college and pass the state mandated tests.  To become a classroom teacher, one must graduate college, complete a teacher credentialing program, be a student teacher (aka teach for free for 6 months), and clear their credential through a two year induction program.  Every five years, teachers must complete continuing education to renew their credential.  In addition to all of this, Sylvan has a subject specific training program for each subject taught at the learning center.

We have a variety of teachers and it is a great strength for the center.  We have elementary teachers, private school teachers, high school teachers, a UCD teacher, and a UCD grad student (math specialist). I am fully credentialed (jr. high through college), have a masters degree in education, and have been in teaching for over 8 years.  by the way, I am not the boss.  I am just a happy Sylvan teacher.
