20080507 15:32:23 nbsp Howdy, Silvia... if you want, you can use the antispam macro: just put your email address like this {{{Mailto(sylflores AT gmail DOT com)}}}, and when somebody who is logged in (a real person) sees it, it is a nice email link.  To people not logged in (say, spammer bots looking for email addresses), it displays with the AT and DOT format. Users/JabberWokky
