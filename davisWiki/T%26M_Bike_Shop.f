T&M Bike Shop is one of our local bicycle shops and offers sales, repair, parts, and accessories.  Located in the University Mall, they are authorized Sunlite Dealer. Bike repair, bike parts, and bike accessories are cheapest in the area. They carry used bikes and new bikes (Sun Cruiser and Origin8 single speed bikes). Theyve had a wide range, including: Specialized, Trek, Cannondale, GT, Fuji, Centurion, NISHIKI, Raleigh, Peugeot, and Bianchi.  This doesnt mean they are authorized or can necessarily get original parts, but just that they have these bikes go through their shop.

20130810 16:05:40 nbsp Good prices for good quality used (though not that old) bikes, mostly roads and hybrids. The owners a nice guy, knows his way around a bike well. He puts up listings on Craigslists for the bikes he has available. Bought a bike here last week, looks maybe 5 years old, if that. Its fast and really smooth. Cant really find any fault with it, and it only cost less than a third of MSRP! Users/TheShah

20140303 13:46:45 nbsp Just got my bike fixed from this guy.  He really knows what he is doing, and makes sure that the job is done right, even if it means spending a bit more time and effort.  Prices, at least for my repair (a new tube and brake repair), were really cheap.  Will certainly be coming back to him in the future! Users/JacobL

20140329 18:29:30 nbsp I lost my keys to my bike and the owner came all the way to my apartment and cut my Ulock!  Really nice and helpful guy!  I definitely recommend coming here to get your bike worked on! Users/ErinGlasspool

20140502 15:50:08 nbsp I got tons of flat tires and I have been visiting T&M bike shops at least five times. He always repairs my flat quickly as a breeze and charge me very inexpensively. The location is so convenient at UMall so a quick walkin always solve my problem. The guy checked the wheel/rim carefully and found some problem and try to even out the sharp points in the rim (that may be the reason giving me flat again and again). Unlike the downtown bike shop, that sometimes ask you to leave  the bike there so they can take care of it later, T&M always gets my problematic bike fix right away (maybe wait like 5 mins for one or two people in front of me).
