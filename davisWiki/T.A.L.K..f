Theres no time like early childhood to master a second language, right? But few elementary schools offer foreign language instruction. Thats where TALK comes in! TALK offers foreign language classes for kids.

TALK started in 1994 when a group of parents decided to collectively pool their efforts and resources together to offer language classes to kids. It has grown to offer various levels of French and Spanish classes to K6 children at several Davis elementary schools, depending on demand and parent involvement. Though the entire program is run as a parentled nonprofit collective, enrollment and logistical support is provided by the Davis Art Center, which also provides classroom space for the North Davis Elementary School campus. Birch Lane School, Korematsu Elementary School and Pioneer Elementary School classes are oncampus.

TALK emphasizes playbased and creative approaches to language learning, using games, roleplaying, art projects, music, cultural activities and physical engagement.

Class sizes are limited to 6 to 12 children. Teachers are native or nearnative speakers with enthusiasm for sharing their language, who enjoy young children. Classes are held every morning before the start of the school day. TALK aims is to provide language enrichment to children who are still at an age when they can easily absorb a new language.

Classes are held daily from 7:40 am to 8:10 am. Currently, TALK is able to provide French and Spanish classes at Birch Lane, Korematsu, North Davis and Pioneer Elementary Schools. The North Davis classes are held at the Davis Art Center, and a teacher walks North Davis Elementary children to school after class.

As a parent collective, TALK can offer classes as the collective need arises, in response to parent leadership from different elementary school campuses or from different language needs.



20120224 21:59:16 nbsp My 6yo daughter started in TALK when she started Kindergarten this year. Its been great. She has fun each morning in French, which helps her wake up and get ready for school. Her teacher walks her and a few other kids to their classrooms, and shes developing vocabulary while also associating foreign language with fun. Classes are small and the teachers really enjoy kids!
