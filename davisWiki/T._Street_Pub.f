T. St. pub is THE hang out for the elite crowd of the Davis Scene. The Cool Club of Four (made up of Users/TaylorStreet Taylor, Users/MattJojola Matty, NAM TURK NAM TURK, and Users/DeannaBrusco Deanna) can usually be found raging hell in this tiny bedroom after almost any party in the small town of Davis. Other party goers are commonly present as well, and the tiny abode has even been known to host even more exclusive than usual Study Parties. The drink of choice on tap is more than likely Keybones, Cminus, and of course the obligatory Jim Beam.






EW, DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH SPERM IS DECORATING THE WALLS OF THIS PLACE? YOU CAN GET PREGGERS JUST LOOKING AT THE PICTURE!


UGH!
