First names are easy to http://taps.ucdavis.edu/admin/Org2008.pdf find with minimal effort from a variety of sources. Secondly, if there were an internal investigation going on no one who was involved in it would comment on it here. Third, your combination of suspension and/or possible arrest in the last line demonstrates a lack of understanding of how the University handles cases like you suggest this is.
