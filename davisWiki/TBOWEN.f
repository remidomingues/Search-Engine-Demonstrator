20070828 08:23:25 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. I noticed your removal of a http://daviswiki.org/Yoga?actiondiff&version240&version139 comment on the Yoga page and your edits to The Bo Tree. It may be helpful for you to read Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner. I went and took a look at the http://daviswiki.org/Users/LookyLoo?actionuserinfo other edits that were made by the same user that left the comment that you removed and while their comment wasnt signed with a linked signature their contribution was constructive. Im guessing however that their comment refers to the previous location. As such a better course might have been to note that with a response rather than just deleting their contribution.
