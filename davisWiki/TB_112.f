TB112 was one of the Temporary Buildings found on the west side of Walker Hall. It formerly served as a classroom and multimedia lab (printers, scanners, macs, expensive software, etc) for the Design Design Department, but moved to 134 Walker Hall Walker in preparation for the removal of the Temporary Buildings which was done in Summer 2010. As the http://design.ucdavis.edu/services/walker134.html website states, the lab is for design majors and not an Computer Labs IT lab for the entire campus.
