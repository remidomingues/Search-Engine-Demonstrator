From Thoughts to Tangibles

TEAM (Translating Engineering Advances to Medicine) is a unit of the Biomedical Engineering department. They held an Open House and Launch Party on 20140115 in which they presented who they were and gave tours of the facilities. They have perhaps the best fabricating facilities in Davis, and they are open to anyone (for reasonable fees) who requires their services. Their 3D Printing services are available to everyone, though there is a priority for those within UCD.

Their equipment includes (from memory):
Two Stratasys PolyJet 3D printers
Two Makerbot 3D printers
One Ultimaker 3D printer
SLA 3D printers
3D scanners
One PCB router
One 190 watt laser cutter (wood, plastic, thin steel)
One injection molder
One CNC mill
Laminar flow hoods
Incubators
CAD/CAM software (i.e. Eagle)
