Welcome to the Wiki Howdy, Mr. or Ms. Front, and Welcome to the Wiki!   You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you (or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here).  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  You seem to have accidentally edited the front page for the entire wiki rather than creating a new wiki entry.  If you are familiar with LiveJournal, it is roughly equivalent to erasing the entire community and replacing it with your single post rather than adding a new post.  As a result, your addition was quickly removed (so the wiki was brought back up!).  You might want to poke around and learn how to use the wiki a bit before you edit again... you are most certainly welcome to edit, but erasing the main front page to do so is a bit over the top.  ;)   Nobody erased anything out of spite or dislike for you... you just happened to accidentally trash the wiki when you made your edit, and they restored it.  Regardless, welcome to the wiki, and I hope your next edit is a bit more successful.    Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
