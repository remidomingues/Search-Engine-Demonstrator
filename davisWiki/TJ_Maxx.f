TJ Maxx, the latest chain retail newcomer in town, offers highquality, brandname fashions for up to 60% less than department store prices. It is generally considered to be in a similar category of department stores as Marshalls and Ross. TJ Maxx, located at the Second Street Crossing shopping center, held its grand opening on October 20th, 2013 from 8am8pm during which they gave out reusable, albeit cheap quality, bags to the first 1,000 customers. About 3/4 of the store is dedicated to women, while mens clothing take up less than 1/4; the shoes section only has womens shoes.
