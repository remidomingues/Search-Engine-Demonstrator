MISSION STATMENT: The mission of the UC Davis TRIO Scholars Program is simply to do everything we can do to promote the academic and personal well being of TRIO Scholars. In building a strong sense of community, and drawing on resources both within and outside the program, we strive to give our students the best chance possible of doing good things in every sense.

The TRIO Scholars Program is a federally funded effort to improve the retention and graduation rates of firstgeneration, incomequalified, and disabled undergraduates at UC Davis. Housed with the Learning Skills Center, the TRIO Scholars Program, which recruits participants by invitation, is designed to provide academic. personal,and career support to participants from entry into the university to graduation.
