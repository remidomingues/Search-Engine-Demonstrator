20070713 11:37:01 nbsp The person who answers the phone at the above number....is weeeeiiirrrdd, but very nice.  I spoke to her for a minute or two, and she gave me Bobs number. Im not sure who exactly he was with the company, whether he is an owner, manager, etc, but I spoke to him a bit longer.  He was very nice, and extremely helpful and understanding.  It was a great experience, my first ever good one with a property management company, much less a nonlocal one.  Users/EdWins
