The T Line serves Davis Senior High School Davis High School, and is a supplement to the P/Q Bus Line P and P/Q Bus Line Q lines, which already serve Davis Senior High School DSHS as a regular stop. This bus travels down roads not covered by the P/Q Bus Line P and P/Q Bus Line Q lines, in order to make it possible for most Davis residents to easily access the school.

This line starts at Cowell and Research Park, travels through El Macero area, up through Northeast Davis (Moore/Wright Streets) and down to Davis Senior High School DSHS.

This line runs once in the mornings and once in the afternoons, only when Davis Joint Unified School District DJUSD is in session.
