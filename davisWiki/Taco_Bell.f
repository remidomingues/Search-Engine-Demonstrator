Taco Bell is a fast food restaurant that offers inexpensive food using Mexican inspired ingredients and presentation (burritos and the like can be found, but much of their menu is made up of dishes referred to using trademarked words that sound vaguely Spanish).  The downtown Bell does not have a drive through but does have good parking and generally better service.  It was also remodeled in 2011, reopening in late May.

Use the Super Saver Card and get a free medium soft drink with purchase of $3 or more. Taco Bell also has Hot Sauce packages called Border Sauce. This sauce is rather vinegary but does marginally improve the taste of their food. The sauce is not actually very hot which is presumably why it is called Border Sauce rather than Hot Sauce. Compare it to another hot sauce packet in town, Del Taco Del Scorcho.

The sauce comes in three flavors, ordered in ascending spiciness:
   Mild  Yellow Packet  Quite weak.  The most obvious vinegar taste of the three Border Sauces.
   Hot  Orange Packet  More of a chili pepper flavor. Note: The hot sauce is actually hotter than the fire sauce.
   Fire  Red Packet  Some spiciness, even more chili pepper flavor.

While I typically prefer spicier sauce, I find that the Hot sauce has more flavor than the Fire sauce, which I attribute to there being more onions in the Hot sauce.  Users/MikeIvanov

Yeah, I agree. I dont think the Fire is hotter in any meaningful way, and it tastes worse.  Users/JaimeRaba jr

The ridiculously small size of the Silo Taco Bell waiting area (where you pick up your food) inspired an even smaller but vocal contingent of the March 4, 2010 Public Education protest.

The downtown location has WiFi.

The restrooms at the downtown location sport Dyson Airblades, the fastest, most hygienic hand dryers in the world.

20051107 09:12:59 nbsp mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm... :  i dont eat any of the meat though. grade d just isnt my thing.  Users/NoraSandstedt
  Actually, beef doesnt get letter grades. The wiki:WikiPedia:newspeak newspeak names assigned to beef are as follows:
         Prime
         Choice
         Select
         Standard
         Commercial
         Utility
         Cutter
         Canner
  Ive never seen anything below select. Furthermore, things that do get letter grades (butter, eggs, etc) get grades of AA, A, B. The highest grade poultry can receive is A, but butter and milk and I think eggs can be AA. The whole system is pretty confusing, and dairys not my field.  Users/arlenabraham arlen
    Honey is also graded A,B,C. But it is very straightforward. Youll only see letter A in stores, and B/C end up in... who knows what. Hey, anyone tried the honey BBQ sauce at KFC lately? KJM

 My point is that it is passed in America, but its not approved of in Canada because we pass lower quality meat than them. That, and its mixed with oatmeal because the same monopoly that owns Taco Bell owns Quaker Oats.  Users/NoraSandstedt nora beth
    Several of these statements are incorrect or appear to be incorrect.  Yum Brands is strictly a restaurant company (Five fast food brands) and doesnt own any food retail brands.  Before that they were owned by PepsiCo, which does own Quaker Oats... but Yum was spun off in 1997, four years before PepsiCo bought Quaker Oats (for Gatorade).  Thus, at no point now or in the past has Taco Bell been associated with Quaker Oats.  In addition, they are neither a legal nor de facto monopoly in any way.  Plenty of competition.  Finally, other than BSE (Mad Cow) blocks (which are all currently lifted), the import of beef to and from Canada is very much allowed... and the Canada and the US have the same grading grid, although Canada uses numbers and letters and the US uses (as Arlen documents above) a series of names, which are diagonal stripes across the grid.  The grid is age vs. fat content, by the way, or technically maturity vs. marbling.  It is possible that there are other quality tests that apply, but the grading is the same (although the end result isnt translatable due to the USs diagonal categories).  Canada does have stricter regulations regarding meatpacking and animal feed, but that just applies to the spread of BSE, which is almost nonexistent in either country and, if it were to strike, would be just as like to hit a $50 steak at a high class restaurant as a $1 taco. Finally, while I cant find a resource for the ingredients in the Taco Bell beef, I can look up just the beef fillings nutritional info (by selecting a Taco without shell or condiments).  It contains zero fiber.  It is slightly possible that there is some oatmeal, but it would be a very very minute amount.  Users/JabberWokky jw

20070225 09:10:02 nbsp The service at Taco Bell on Pioneer in Woodland is pretty bad. The only fast food place Ive called (twice!) to complain about. They consistently screwedup orders, and have a bad attitude toward customers to the point of being flatout rude. For a while, they had a handwritten sign taped to the drivethru menu Have your money READY when you get to the window!!!  After my first complaint, TB corporate apologized and mailed us a coupon...which that same TB refused to honor! (prompting the second call). I avoid that one, now. If youre in Woodland and have to have Taco Bell, go to the one on Main St., where service and quality are up to standard. Users/DukeMcAdow

20070427 13:43:58 nbsp I had the worst fast food service experience of my life last week at the G Street location. Granted, they were swamped with business and with only two employees on duty, but cashier Saralina was incredibly rude, and she was not washing her hands between handling food, money, and sneezing and coughing into her hands, and wiping her runny nose. First I spoke up about my order being wrong (I said nothing of the 25minute wait (I was timing it because I had made the trip to Taco Bell only because its 2 blocks from my house, and I wanted to eat in time to get back to a basketball game on TV before halftime ended)), and she said they were out of a certain menu item. I asked her why she didnt tell me that before when I ordered, but she answered with unnecessary attitude. Thats when I dropped the Wash your hands deal on her. Many in line also spoke up because they had noticed, too. She erupted at us. She refused to prioritize the replacement of my order. I demanded a refund, which she slammed into my hands. I made it back home halfway into the 4th quarter, still hungry. I called corporate to complain (I NEVER DO THAT!), and yesterday, five gift certificates came in the mail from the apologetic franchise owner. Users/RickEle

20071116 20:29:56 nbsp I wouldnt recommend downtown Bell...I ordered a cheese quesadilla and a bean burrito there in October from cashier Taylor, and she and another girl were the only ones there. Well, it really wasnt pleasant. When I took a bite into my quesadilla, it tasted weird; when I opened it shed given me VELVEETA cheese and hardly any real cheese (when I say real I mean Taco Bell standards), so my boyfriend took it back for me and before eating my burrito I checked it. It had weird sauce that looked aged and even more velveeta cheese. Needless to say, I didnt eat the burrito but I did get a free new quesadilla and cinnamon twists from them. The most problems Ive ever had with the Mace location is them not putting jalape√±o sauce on my quesadilla, but I can live with that. ALSOdont eat at the one in Dixon (I dont know which one), because my brotherinlaw found MAGGOTS in his food. Users/HannahFolkes

20080219 20:15:19 nbsp My roommate and I always remember that Taco Bell is on G street because G stands for gordo... which is what we feel like after every culinary adventure at TB. And yet, we return on an almost daily basis (seriously  where is the support group for TB addicts?).

I miss the chili cheese nachos dearly, but all TB nachos are awesome. So are the bowls of pintos and cheese when you dump some hot sauce in. I dont care that its all complete junk, sometimes you are just in the mood for complete junk. Users/KateAusten

20080417 21:34:45 nbsp I was at the G Street restaurant with my friend last night. The manager, Roger, was serving us. First off, hes a straightup a$$hole. Second thing, there was almost no ice in the machine and Roger treated me like I was some kind of an idiot because I couldnt get it to work (it wasnt working properly on top of the fact that it was almost entirely empty). Then, there was all this mold (or a moldylike substance) all over the machine. The meat tasted odd to boot. I will never go to this location of Taco Bell again until that loser Roger is gone... which may not happen anytime soon. Furthermore, I have filed a complaint to the Yolo County Department of Health.

That being said, the Mace Taco Bell isnt bad at all.
Users/thelonepiper555

20080710 15:41:48 nbsp lol

the ice machine almost fell on a little girl the other day at the G street taco bell. the dude just stared at her and one of the women came out, looked at girl w/ giant piece laying on the ground told her, oh u can still get ice. uhhh. im getting paranoid now about the sanitary conditions. i wasnt big on taco bell, but they get ur food to u fast. and i guess it is what it is...what can u expect?

i do think ill try the mace one, its just located in an awkward place though. and its all right across from healthy subway, how ironic.  Users/KimberlyMiller

20080815 19:48:49 nbsp Recently visited again because I was thirsty. Id like to reiterate that the downtown location smells like homeless people. Users/MattLow

20090106 19:12:58 nbsp Tacobell doesnt have Velveeta cheese... get a life instead of complaining about a one time instance at TACOBELL which was most likely a misunderstanding. Users/T.D.M.

20090131 22:36:11 nbsp As a disclaimer, I love Taco Bell. $3.65 for 2 cheesy double beefs and a large drink is awesome! However I wont touch the Davis locations.

I have had several bad experiences (inexplicably rude manager and incredibly messed up orders) at the downtown Taco Bell, and observed bad sanitary practices (food preparation without gloves) at the Mace Taco Bell. The Taco Bell Express on campus is fine, but overpriced and doesnt carry many of the items I usually order.

The new Taco Bell by IKEA in West Sac is awesome, and the Dixon location is pretty good too... I go to both all too often when Im broke and in the area :) Despite the negative review, Ive had generally good experiences with the Pioneer location in Woodland. Users/ErikFriedlander

20090213 15:13:02 nbsp the one on mace is sooooooo ghetto.  All the employees there look like they have just gotten out of juvie. last time i checked, wearing tall tees and hats to work were not allowed. Users/BettyBean

20090504 16:45:41 nbsp Ive been to the ones in downtown and Silo. Theyre both okay. However, the one in Silo doesnt have the $.79,$.89,$.99 menu, a little disappointed. Users/thtly

20090520 14:08:59 nbsp Apparently the Silo location now charges for sauce. I immediately canceled my order and walked away once I heard this. Absolutely insulting and ridiculous. Anonymous
  As I understood it, they dont actually charge for sauce. They simply ask you what sauces you want, instead of having a big tub of them out for people to grab. This is meant to cut down on waste. I just called and confirmed, they do not charge for the packets. I can only imagine that you misinterpreted them asking which sauces you wanted, and walked away without trying to understand what was going on. Users/JoePomidor
  Oh, they definitely tried to charge me for sauce the last time I was there. There was no confusion. Heres basically what happened:
   < I order a burrito >
   TB girl: What type of sauce/how many would you like?
   Me:      5 fire please
   TB girl: So, burritos normally come with only 3 sauce packs. We need to charge 5 cents extra for each additional pack. Is that okay?
   Me:      Um...why are you guys charging for sauce?
   TB girl: Because we pay for it?
   Me:      Alright, I dont want my food anymore, bye.
   TB girl: Are you sure?
   < I walk away>
   Perhaps they changed back to not charging for sauce? I bet it was pretty damn unpopular. If so, maybe Ill consider eating there again.
  hmm. I was there yesterday, and there was none of this tomfoolery. I called and asked today, and they claimed not to charge. Sounds like they may not know either.Users/JoePomidor

20090603 18:37:52 nbsp Lol. I love how out of all the super picky comments someone bothered to rant about me calling it Velveeta cheese. What I meant was nacho cheese, the thick creamy stuff. When someone says bandaid they really mean a bandage. Calm down, bud. Other than that one problem, I have no qualms with Taco Bell. I go all the time, in fact. :) Users/HannahFolkes

20090720 23:14:48 nbsp i recently went through the drivethrough at the mace location and the kids meal was $2.99 (pretty cheap for a 2 taco, cinnamon twists, toy, and drink, which is usually what i get ) then i went to downtown location and ordered a kids meal, it was $4.49 or something like that (and who ever prepared my food there was pretty stingy about the fillings of the tacos and cinnamon twist, nothing like the mace location) anywho...

does anyone know if theres a price difference between the drivethrough and actually going inside the restaurant? or is it purely just a mace location promotion? or...? Users/TriPpy

  I used to live off of Taco Bell back in San Jose and I am pretty sure the prices at the downtown location are much higher than normal. Users/hankim
  So i went through the drivethrough at the mace location just to look at the prices (luckily they were closed, otherwise taco bell would think me and my roomie were weirdos), so
we looked at the prices and they were sooo much cheaper than the downtown location. the kids meal was indeed $2.99 in comparison to the $4.49ish one in downtown and my roomie also agreed that the prices for the other items on the menu were much cheaper at the mace location. so id recommend going to the mace location if you are closebyish lol plus they are cleaner smells much better inside too... Users/TriPpy

20090816 13:11:09 nbsp i am very mad at taco bell!! they had this text going around and if you showed it to the cashier they wood give you a free burrito. they stopped doing it because to many people got ahold of the message. i used to eat all my meals at taco bell for free! not any more!

  Youre mad at Taco Bell because they wont give you free food?  Users/TheShah

20091106 13:33:59 nbsp Went to the downtown location with a couple coworkers for lunch....the stank drove us out; smelled like sewer or someone exploded in the restroom. I dont know how the people could manage to sit and eat in that. Went to the Mace location instead. Users/CindiDrake

 Thats funny. I went like a week or two ago after dinner time, but it was the Mace one that smelled like someone exploded in the restroom. Seriously. Users/HidetoMatsumoto

20100626 17:32:54 nbsp After the downtown location was remodeled and they started the four and five dollar deals, I have been going there quite a bit. Most of the time, I can get my order a minute after ordering and I can see them making my food right there so its not something thats been sitting around (of course, the individual ingredients have been sitting around). They have improved quite a bit. I avoid the Taco Bell at the Silo though. Takes forever for an order and everything is about 25% more expensive. Also, for some reason, eating from the Silo makes me need to go to the bathroom a few minutes later (not just the Taco Bell, but everything there). Users/hankim

20110218 11:01:33 nbsp The downtown one has no drivethru and smells like a public restroom.  The Chiles Tbell, however, is awesome.  I went one rainy day and we were the only people eating there. The guy at the counter taking our order said If you tell my manager youre going to call the survey number on your receipt, hell probably give you free cinnamon twists. We politely declined, as I was already getting them and the other person didnt like the cinnamon twists.  As we were sitting down eating our food, the guy came over with an empanada and said since you didnt want the twists, heres an empanada. Definitely never going to the other tbell.  CHILES TBELL FOR LIFE!  Users/AndrewWalker
     the stank of shit from the downtown TB was fucking NASTY!!! Users/JoshLawson

20110523 20:36:51 nbsp Went in for the first time today since the remodel. I was impressed not only with the new staff, but also with the higher quality food as well as the aesthetics. It now seems like a very comfortable and relaxing sit down restaurant more than a quickstop fast food joint as far as its visual appeal goes, both inside and out.

The food quality has much improved, presumably due to the new equipment they now have, tastes much fresher and is more consistent than it was previously. Even the fountain soda machine is better.

The new staff, completely different crew, is much friendlier and more professional than previous crews have seemed to me in the past.

Overall, I would rate this new Taco Bell a 4/5 compared to other incarnations of the same genre of food.  Users/WesP
 When I went at night two of the crew were there before.  They transfered to Fairfield during the remodel.Users/BruceHansen

20110621 23:49:25 nbsp Downtown Taco bell used to be pretty nasty. Would never clean the toilets and sometimes the stink would come to the ordering/dining area to such an extent that all you could smell was shit. Also, ordered a chicken soft taco and there was a dead maggot in my lettuce. But last month (june 2011) it has been renovated and looks fairly nice so far Users/JohnathonJosephs

20110804 14:43:35 nbsp Some of us are old enough to remember before the first remodel, early 80s I wanna say... they had a REAL bell up there, that would constantly be stolen... mostly be local frats I believe. Users/OldDavis73
