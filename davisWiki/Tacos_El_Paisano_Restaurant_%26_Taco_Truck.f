tacos $1, burritos $3, Tax included


This business started off as a humble Roach Coach taco truck, but the owners have since opened a sitdown version with a vastly expanded menu lineup. YAY! The truck is just off the 113 Freeway in nearby Woodland, and is considered by some to be the best truck among several in that town. The sitdown location is located on the same road as the truck and fairly near to it. {Perhaps the truck will be closed down someday, but it still seems to be operating at this point.) Proximity to Davis and superior quality make it easily worth the trip, considering that the Restaurants Mexican food in Davis is generally blander than that from towns with a larger population of hispanics.

To get there from Davis, head west from 113 and it is on the south side of Main in the parking lot of Woods Flooring and Supply Co. Watch out for the hidden dip in the driveway if you are driving a sedan.

Excellent tacos are comparable to those from fine trucks in Oakland and LA, and are served with a lime wedge, rabanito (radish) and red or green salsa. Choice of meats includes:

  azada/asada/beef
  adobada/al pastor/marinated pork
  carnitas/deepfried pork
  lengua/tongue

  pollo/chicken
  cabeza/beef cheek and head (particularly moist and tasty)

Also has burritos (vegetarian available, but may not be vegetarian) and drinks such as jamaica/hibiscus.

20060910 22:54:01 nbsp The tacos at this truck are much better than anything Ive tried in Davis (from Chuys Taqueria, El Mariachi and the South Davis branch of Taqueria Guadalajara). Not as good as the best of the Fruitvale neighbourhood in Oakland, but we should be thankful it is not too far away. Users/SimonChan

20061211 08:56:29 nbsp oh my god.  Finally i have found some decent mexican up near davis.  There adobada is so good, almost as good as the best places in LA.  Tacos are only a dollar including tax.  what a deal.  however their horchata is not very good Users/MattHh

20080206 16:49:52 nbsp these are some good tacos Users/DagonJones

20100220 14:15:58 nbsp My partner and I (both vegan) had the veggie burritos here.  We didnt ask, but didnt notice any indication that they were anything but vegan.  And they were delicious to boot!  Good thing, as the vegan dining options in Woodland seem pretty limited.  Well be back. Users/IAmNewHere

20100505 22:27:15 nbsp This place is awesome! I had azada, carnitas, y pollo tacos and they were all good but I was surprised that pollo was my favorite of the three. Great spice to the meat and the tortillas are fresh with the perfect amount of crisp on the edges. Note that the menu on the truck is only in Spanish, so make sure you know the translations above (ie, if you didnt already know that lengua was tongue, etc... haha). Tripas was not an option when I went, but maybe its something they only have sometimes? Im also not sure how people ordered a vegetarian burrito... was it just beans? The burritos looked like they were just meat and beans to me, though I have not tried them yet. Users/SRB

20100621 13:49:34 nbsp The vegetarian burritos are just rice, beans, and cilantro/spices.  They are delicious, though. Users/IAmNewHere

20100722 11:45:12 nbsp Just went there yesterday. They dont have tripe anymore but everything else is still there and a dollar. Their tortillas really make the tacos amazing, Im not a big fan or corn tortillas but these are perfectly grilled so their lightly crispy on the outside. I think the carnitas is the best followed by the adobada. The chicken and the asada is good too. Their lengua was too soft, i usually like lengua tho. Cabeza was flavorful but too fatty. Overall, great taco truck, super cheap, super good.  Users/nqbui89

20100813 13:25:08 nbsp Fresh hand made corn tortillas, great meats and a variety of salsa.  Did I mention the tacos are 1$ each.  Order 4 tacos and bottle of coke for an even 5$.  Incredible and easily the best tacos around. Users/mjwood

20101220 16:04:23 nbsp My fiance and I checked out this place last week, and it was definitely worth the trip to Woodland.  Cheap, delicious tacos almost exactly like those Ive had in . Mexico.  They dont have horchata or any other drink besides can sodas, which was the only, minor disappointment.   Users/JasonEdmonds

20110304 12:17:06 nbsp Man, I was so excited when I learned about this place! Sadly it disappointed. Im addicted to tacos from taco trucks like a drug addict is addicted to heroin. And this place is definitely the closest Ive gotten to REAL tacos since leaving my hometown, but they sadly fall short. The meat is not the best Ive ever had (Drake voice!) but its ok. The tortillas are sometimes a bit too crunchy, which I like, but my boyfriend disagrees with. I love the onion chunk they give you, it is so delicious. The salsa, oh man the salsa... was not good at all. A mexican place makes it or breaks it with me based on their salsa, and this was a very white tomatoey salsa with no spice whatsoever. I understand that some people dont like it as spicy as I do (NOTHING is ever to spicy for me), but it would be nice if they offered a hotter version to those that consume spicier foods. You cant beat the price, for $5 I can get 4 tacos and a soda, unbeatable! All in all, when Im craving tacos I would go here again, but Ill be dreaming of the tacos from home... Users/jwieland1989

20110625 11:07:57 nbsp I am from Southern California and this is as close as it gets(both price and taste). Much better than mexican restaurant in Davis. They put a ton of meat on their tacos. Their burritos are a bit dry for my taste, so I ask them to add salsa verde(green salsa) in it and the lemon helps too. My favorites are the lengua and the cabeza. It is definitely worth the 1015  minute drive!

Theradish, jalapeno, lemon, and a chunk of grilled onion on the side adds to the flavor. It is the little things that makes a big difference! Users/kkha91

20110703 23:39:05 nbsp I love this place. Both the taco truck (for togo meals) and the restaurant (also has a wider selection) are delicious! I went to the restaurant after my graduation ceremony and also on my birthday this year so I love it! Users/BryceH

20130111 21:48:37 nbsp Two tacos is probably sufficient for one person, but I tend to eat four. I prefer the Asada and Adobada over the Pollo and Carnitas. Some day Ill day Ill toughen up and try the Cabeza and Lengua. It can get pretty busy here at peak lunch and dinner so prepare to wait accordingly. Definitely in contention for best soft tacos in Yolo County. Users/MikeyCrews
