20101012 22:48:56 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki! You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, so we know who were talking to. Im Users/MaxMikalonis Max, and I did just revert your edits to the page Tacos and Beer because the wiki generally frowns upon deleting pages and removing other peoples comments. The business page on the wiki is a community page it is not owned by the business owner, but is instead for the community to look and learn about as a whole. You might want to check out our Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner guide for business owners to get a better sense of what I am talking about. That being said, by clicking the How to edit edit and preview buttons you can change the Tacos and Beer page to better reflect the new ownership, as long as you dont remove the old comments (which are under the comments bar).

20101012 23:12:09 nbsp Hi Max, thanks for your comments. I appreciate the info. I do have concerns however about the set up of the wiki. Since most people do not use their real names, they are free to write terrible things about a business and never think twice about the damage those comments can do. It cost several hundred thousand dollars to open a business in downtown Davis, and ghost comments that could have very well have been made by a competing business can do all sorts of damage.How do I find out who is managing this site? I would like to have the owner information changed because it is very misleading and completely inaccurate.   Users/TacosandBeer

20101012 23:29:15 nbsp ??? People talk about an establishment regardless of where the discussion occurs, on the wiki you get a chance to refute even the anonymous cowards. We encourage people to use real names because this is about the local area, and the people we interact with. Would you introduce yourself to me on the street as Tacos&Beer? Im pretty sure you would be X from Tacos and beer. If the ownership has changed then archiving the comments is no problem, but we tend to frown upon the deletion of material. If you have any questions about how we do things, just ask. Be sure to check out the guide for business owners! Users/StevenDaubert Post Script: We all manage this site, I do, you do, Max does. Contribute and add information, no one is above anyone else...

20101012 23:37:18 nbsp Most people here do use their real names, as you can tell from this page. Just because you have concerns doesnt mean you can just go and delete stuff anyway. Are the actual owners ROMERO, MARIA GUADALUPE or ROMERO, LARENA MARIE instead of Joe, and Antonio Romero? Thats what the liquor license records say and the restaurant page can certainly say that too. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20101012 23:40:27 nbsp The new owner is Joe Romero and the ABC website is in the process of being changed to reflect that info. I wasnt trying to delete ll of the info on the page I was trying to edit the owner info. Im not extremely tech savvy so that is why I asked for help! Users/TacosandBeer

20101012 23:42:10 nbsp I think it is fixed now. Users/TacosandBeer
