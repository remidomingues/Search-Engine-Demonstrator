About Tae Kwon Do
Tae Kwon Do is a martial arts martial art and combat sport originating in Korea. In Korean, tae kwon do loosely translates to the way of the hand and foot. As a martial art, it usually emphasizes kicking and mobility in sparring; blocks, hand strikes, joint locks and takedowns are also often covered in training. Tae kwon do was traditionally considered to be a hard art, because of its use of proactive hard blocks to prevent strikes as well as offensive striking techniques. However, perhaps due to increasing interest in competitive sparring, it has become softened with the use of mobility and dodges to reduce strikes.

There are two major tae kwon do organizations, each with their own focus and emphasis on style: the World Taekwondo Federation (WTF) and the International Taekwondo Federation (ITF). Each group has a different set of poomse or forms, but much of the stances, strikes and blocks are the same.
