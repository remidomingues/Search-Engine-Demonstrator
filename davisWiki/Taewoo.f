Hi Taewoo, I think youre a little confused. Talk Pages serve as meta discussion pages where people can discuss the content of a page. If you would like to contact Oldenfowl United via the wiki, I would suggest adding a comments box to their page by adding {{{Comments}}} and leaving a note there. However, your comment might go unnoticed for awhile, so it might be best to contact the Davis Adult Recreational Soccer League. You may also be interested in IM sports. Users/ArlenAbraham
