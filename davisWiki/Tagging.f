Tagging is a subtype of Graffiti that involves marking an object with a tag, which is typically a sequence of letters indicating a person or group (frequently a Gangs gang).

Bathrooms Bathroom stalls on campus have become forums for Conversations on bathroom walls written conversation... but what about elsewhere? Do taggers dare leave the safety of an enclosed room or stall to spread their sagely word? Some do, apparently...




I actually was surprised to see some tagging on the wall in Wellman 216 when I was sitting in the back.  Most of the discussion is about birds, penises, and sports.  Nothing impressive however but Ill get a pic.
