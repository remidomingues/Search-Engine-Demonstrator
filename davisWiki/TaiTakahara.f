Describe TaiTakahara here.

A graduate and employment overemployed, Tai is quite happy exploring Davis and investigating the Universe that exists outside the glow of fluorescent lights and politely phrased conversations. Currently Tai is hunting phenonema known as Flash Mobbing and is intrigued by the version of Mobbing known as Pillow Fight Club. Tai rather likes referring to self in third party format.
