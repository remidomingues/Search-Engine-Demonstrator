 Background 

By use of the words Tai Chi, most people actually mean TaiChi Chuan (Taijiquan), or possibly TaiChi (Taiji).

Usually, Tai Chi is used when actually only some particular aspect of TaiChi Chuan (Taijiquan),  the highly disciplined, extensive and varied, so called internal martial practices are meant, or when only one of the various specific Styles of the Martial Arts that go by that name are meant.   Some of the most common Family Styles of TaiChi Chuan (Taijiquan) are Chen Style, Yang Style (pronounced with a short aa sound; and where Yang here has nothing to do with the Yang in the Yin/Yang Symbol), Wu Style, and Sun Style (pronounced with a short uu sound).   All these internal Martial Art styles which fall under the heading of TaiChi Chuan (Taijiquan) are of relatively recent Chinese origin, sevenhundredandfifty years or less.  The Wikipedia article on wiki:WikiPedia:Tai_Chi_Chuan Tai Chi Chuan is definitely worthy of a read.

When Tai Chi is used to mean TaiChi (Taiji), this refers to the Taoist (Daoist) symbol, or what in American English is often called the Yin/Yang symbol.   This symbol refers to an ancient philosophical concept regarding the nature of what is actual reality, and dates back possibly two thousand years or more.   If you are interested in learning more about this Chinese philosophical system, look to the sources of Taoist (Daoist) philosophy, at the least as refered to in wiki:WikiPedia:Tao_Te_Ching Tao Te Ching and the wiki:WikiPedia:I_Ching I Ching.

In the above comments regarding the use of the term Tai Chi the following words are in the standard English written Romanization transliteration of the Mandarin Chinese words (i.e. the wiki:WikiPedia:Wade_Giles WadeGiles system):   chi,   chi,   chi kung,   TaiChi,   TaiChi Chuan,   Taoism;   and the equivalent words in the standard mainland Chinese Mandarin Romanization transliteration of the Mandarin Chinese (i.e. the wiki:WikiPedia:Pin_yin PinYin system) are: ji,    qi,    qigong,       Taiji,      Taijiquan,        Daoism.


  I would highly recommend against taking Tai Chi from Daniel Quincy. I personally cannot believe the man is a Martial Art instructor. editDespite his being very behind on a lot of rent/utility payments, I changed what I wrote, so that the guy wouldnt attempt to sue me for defamatory comments /edit JimmyPan JimmyPan
