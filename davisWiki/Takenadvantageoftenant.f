20120315 15:42:45 nbsp http://daviswiki.org/The_Edge_Apartments?actiondiff&version273&version172 This edit seems to do the trick.  Looks good, and it clears up the confusion I was concerned about.  Thanks for working with me on this. Users/TomGarberson

20120315 18:04:29 nbsp Thats certainly understandable.  Are you comfortable with the way the comments are laid out now? Users/TomGarberson

20120315 18:05:33 nbsp I used to visit St. Pete all the time; I have some friends there, most of whom are connected to the Rocky Horror Picture Show in town.  Ive lived several places in Florida. Users/JabberWokky

20120315 18:20:30 nbsp UCF?  I have spent time both on campus and in the bar across the way playing pool.  I was even a band that played in some locations around UCF many many years ago.  I know youre worried about being outed to your landlord (which would really stink), so dont feel under any pressure to answer.  But if you quietly opened up an different account later...

In all seriousness, its normally far more light here on the wiki, with more fun and jokes around here than this little double drama.  Oh, things do get stupid over something new every couple months, but theres a pretty good group of people here, and its a neat project to document all the little things in Davis.  Users/JabberWokky

20120315 18:21:45 nbsp Takensorry about earlier. I got a bit caught up and didnt see Toms notice about removing it until he specifically said something to me. Users/PeterBoulay
