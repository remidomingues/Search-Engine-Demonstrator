I am on the search for a place that serves Takoyaki.

Anyone know of anywhere nearby?

Okonomiyaki is good, too!


The cookie monster photo is (I assume) copyrighted by PBS.  This page doesnt make a whole lot of sense to me (though, I looked up with Takoyaki means  its octopus balls, in case you were wondering).  Delete?

call that phone number first. i mean, personally, i think this is an excellent user page ct

I think its arguable that its a piece of art.  Lets just leave it up.  It has much coolness. The Labster

Cookie Monster character (C) http://www.sesameworkshop.org Sesame Workshop (is that good enough?)

I understand there is a Japanese guy living in Davis who imported a takoyaki grill from Japan, but hes been fairly elusive so far
I cant find him. allwheat
