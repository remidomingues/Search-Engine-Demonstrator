 Candidate Statement 


Hey Everyone!

My name is TAL TOPF and I am running for ASUCD Senate with the NOW slate! I am a Communications and Psychology double major from Los Angeles. It’s THAT time of year when we get to elect the group of people who will make a difference on our campus. There are many reasons I think I should be elected an ASUCD Senator, but by far the most important is that I LOVE DAVIS! I enjoy every moment I spend on campus and this is greatly due to the amazing ASUCD resources available to me. I work at the information center at the Memorial Union and I am in a sorority on campus. Being a student here is a great experience but I think I can improve campus life even more.

If elected, here are just a few of the changes I would like to see at UC Davis:

EXPAND RESEARCH AND INTERNSHIP OPPORTUNITIES
Internship and research opportunities are important to a wellrounded college experience. Research can often guide our decisions on what we want to do after college, allow us to use what we learn in class, and get references for graduate school or careers. There are so many research and internship opportunities, but there isn’t an easy mechanism for students to find these experiences. I want to create a website that will connect students with professors looking for undergraduate interns. This website will not only provide students with more opportunities, but will also continue to make UC Davis a top research institution.

MAKE CLUBS AND ORGANIZATIONS MORE ACCESSIBLE TO STUDENTS
We are a huge and diverse campus! With so many opportunities, it becomes hard to keep up with when clubs have meetings, fundraisers, and other events. I want to assure that, even if you are not a member of a club, you will know what is going on and what kind of events there are with all different campus groups. I will do this by working with Center for Student Involvement so that it can better fit students needs. I want us to celebrate and support our entire Davis community and increase Aggie Pride.

NOW is the time to VOTE TAL TOPF #1 and the rest of the NOW slate #2#5.
