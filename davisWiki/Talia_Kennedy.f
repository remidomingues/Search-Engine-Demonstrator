Talia Kennedy served as the 20062007 campus editor and the 2007 winter and springquarter features editor of The California Aggie. Prior to being a dual editor, she was a news writer for The Aggies campus desk during the 20052006 academic year. During that time, she wrote stories for The Aggies campus, features, science and technology and arts and entertainment desks. She wrote over 240 stories for The Aggie, more than any other single writer or editor then at the newspaper or since. At times in the summer, it felt like she was producing half of the Aggies content.

In May 2007, some The California Aggie Controversies controversy came into play at The Aggie. In a public letter, http://daviswiki.org/The_California_Aggie_Controversies#head205cef068e038c1f1821d3e43421dea9e55e5331 31 writers and staff asked for the resignation of the editor in chief, Peter Hamilton, and Kennedy. In response, both she and the editor in chief requested the resignation of the 31 people who signed said letter and wrote a http://daviswiki.org/The_California_Aggie_Controversies/Reply_to_Hamilton_letter letter responding to the groups allegations. She attempted to get back at one staff member for that persons role in the controversy by using a Users/AnonAggie sockpuppet account to post mean things on that staff members DavisWiki page.

 Where is she now? 

After graduating from UC Davis in two academic years, Talia attended the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism, where she earned a masters in 2009. According to Facebook, she currently works at the San Francisco Chronicle. Oh dear.

She has continued to be published at UC Davis, in the form of a http://ucdavismagazine.ucdavis.edu/issues/sp08/aggies_remember.html UC Davis Magazine article.
