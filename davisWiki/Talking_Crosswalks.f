The talking crosswalk is an automated street crossing system to help visually impaired citizens safely navigate the 1st Street 1st and D Street D street intersection by Davis Commons and the Russell Boulevard Russell and Anderson Road Anderson intersection. The crosswalk signal features a friendly recorded voice that alerts pedestrians when walk signals are on. The sound is played back from the button panel and is generally quieter than the bird call alert used in a similar system which played back from across the street. The talking crosswalk voice is currently English only and features a friendly male voice that repeatedly says Walk sign is on. These walk signs are appearing in cities all across the country and are made by the same manufacturer. The system also included pulse tones and oversized buttons at each panel.
