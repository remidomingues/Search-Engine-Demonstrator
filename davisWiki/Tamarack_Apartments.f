20051111 16:53:16 nbsp Weve had a wonderful time in our 1BR in Tamarack so far... just sunny enough, carpets in good shape, and a shared jacuzzi whose temperature is actually quite nice (we hear this is a rare find in Davis.)  College Town Realty prorated our rent, too, so were only paying $795/month on an 11month lease  they seem pretty flexible about such things.  Of course, only now do we have to move for school reasons.

We need someone to pick up where our reducedrate lease left off  if youre interested in a movein date starting at 12/1, though 12/15, 1/1, etc are also manageable  call me.  5103180056. AraGlennJohanson
