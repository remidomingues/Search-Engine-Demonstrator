Tandem Properties principal business is the property management of apartment communities they they have built, bought or partially own in Davis and Woodland.  The company is owned and managed by a partnership of three longterm Davis residents: John Whitcombe, Bill Roe and Paul Makley.  They are also active in several other partnerships that are involved in the building/acquisition of apartment communities, real estate development, and the development of privatized projects in partnership with UC Davis.  In 2011 they reached an agreement with UCD to provide the housing for transfer strudents.  As part of the deal, Tandem is to refurbish all properties for that purpose.  One of those properties is Arlington Farms.  Tandem is known for being a very active and visible member of the community with a long history of supporting local nonprofits, arts, sports, environmental and other civic causes.

Local properties managed by Tandem include:
  Arlington Farm in West Davis.
  Atriums at La Rue Park Apartments on the UC Davis campus.
  Adobe at Evergreen in West Davis.
  Casitas in North/Central Davis.
  Chautauqua in North/Central Davis.

 Student housing 

Tandems niche in the housing market is student housing.  Tandem has a longstanding reputation for being sensitive to the needs of students (study lounges at all sites), emerging trends of student lifestyles (direct access to Unitrans), and for being tuned into the issues surrounding local politics as they pertain to students.  In 2002, Tandem Properties became one of the founding signatories to the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between ASUCD.  In the MOU, Tandem voluntarily agreed to work with students to ensure an adequate supply of affordable housing, to moderate their own market rent increases, to educate students with respect to their living accommodations therby reducing unnecessary apartment turnover and damages, and to encourage prompt and proper apartment maintenance within student rental units.

A Tandem employee has served on the City  UCD Student Liaison Commission since its inception.  All Tandem Properties use the Davis Model Lease.

Partnership with UC Davis

Tandem has been building privatized projects in partnership with UC Davis since 1984, when Russell Park was constructed to house student families on campus.  In 1986, La Rue Park (Parkway Circle eight houses and Atriums at La Rue Park Apartments graduate student apartments) were built to house student living groups and grad students in conjunction with oncampus child care facilities and storage units.  More recently, Tandem Properties constructed a living and learning residential college for UC Davis with The Colleges at La Rue.

Development History in Davis

The history of Tandem can properly be traced back to the 1950s.  While a senior at Davis Senior High School Davis High, John Whitcombe built his first house to sell speculatively on Oak Avenue, south of 8th Street.  At the time, this was the northwestern edge of town and 8th Street was a dirt road.  Since then, the three Tandem partners have joined with various other partners to build a broad variety of forsale housing and student apartment complexes all over Davis.  Tandem embraced passive and active solar power in the 1970s and were the first developers to incorporate extensive Northstar Greenbelt greenbelt systems and Julie Partansky Pond wildlife habitat into dense housing subdivisions.  The forsale offerings from Tandem all include a wide mixture of home sizes that promote socioeconomic integration in the neighborhood, and often on the same street.

 Pajaro  solar condominiums on Alvarado Avenue
 Amapola  dense, common wall, planned subdivision in North Davis
 Bianco Court  high density, detached homes with narrow/zero lot lines
 Solito Active/Passive Solar Homes  Solar City medium density homes in North Davis near Grande Ave.
 Malaga/Valencia (Covell Park)  high density, zero lot line homes
 Covell Park  custom homes and splitlot duplexes
 Barcelona  splitlot duplex and detached comes in North Davis, west of Anderson Road
 Northstar  custom homes and splitlot duplexes in North Davis

 Covell Village 
In the early 1990s, the three Tandem partners and their families joined four other partners to buy the property known as the Covell Site; it is bounded by F Street on the west, Pole Line Road on the east, Covell Boulevard on the south, and the old landfill on the north.  After a decade of public review, they proposed the construction of Covell Village on that site.  The development required a Measure J vote by the community as the land was placed outside the city limits by the 1987 General Plan. The Covell Village measure was called Measure X and failed on November 5th, 2005 with 58.7% voting No and 41.3% voting Yes.  Covell Village was designed by Michael Corbett of Village Homes fame.

In the November 2005 Election November 2005 Yolo County Election Tandem Properties management prominently displayed Yes on X signs around their properties, often in publicallyvisible common areas and outside of tenants apartments.  At the time, most apartment complexes around town discouraged tenants from displaying any signage in their windows, due to fire insurance liabilities.  This lead to some controversy (an Aggie article was written), and Lamar Heystek got the Election Code changed to allow for tenants to display political signage in rented space.

 In the mid1970s, Tandem built what at the time was the largest solar apartment community in the US, Suntree Apartments.

20050919 20:07:02 nbsp Not only do they give 100% of your deposit back if you clean your apartment, but you get 8% interest on it. Users/CarlMcCabe

20050925 12:38:09 nbsp I live at Casitas and so far the management have been very prompt in responding to work requests. Users/KenjiYamada

20050925 13:06:39 nbsp Anderson Place was a letdown.  Management wasnt great, though she was only promoted to manager a little before Thanksgiving. Never got packages (really frustrating), took weeks of asking them over and over (and trying to track down maintanence) before maintainence would even take a peek at it. Apartment was dirty when we got it, and they took 4 weeks before they came to clean it.  And our $300 dollar deposit got $6 as the interest back. 2% for us, definitly not 8.   Users/EdWins ES

Tandem Properties supports November 2005 Election/Measure X Measure X as well as Tim Taylor in the November 2005 Election November 2005 Yolo County Election.  I know this because my apartment complex, Casitas (as well as the nextdoor Chautauqua), had YesonX and VoteTimTaylor poster boards in all of the publicallyvisible common areas.  The signs were primarily on the grass areas along Anderson Road as well as surrounding the properties signs.  A few of the signs were right outside of residents windows because the grass along Anderson is also very close to many apartments.

I didnt suspect that these poster boards could have been put up by our mangement.  Wouldnt our management think better than to make political statements on our shared property?  Because I thought these were being haphazardly posted by random folks, I took it upon myself to take the signs down over the last week.  Regardless of my personal opinions on what they advertised, I felt it wasnt right that they were all around our apartments.  I was taking some of them down when the manager told me to stop and alerted me that Tandem Properties had endorsed these items and the management was putting them up.

I understand that, legally speaking, they may have a right to put up political advertisements all over our apartments.  But the posting of these political advertisements by Tandem highlights the basic inequality of the landlordtenant relationship: We arent allowed to have any form of sign at all (even outside of our apartment), whereas Tandem can impose their signs on us.  Even beyond this issue of inequality is the principle that we share our property and work together to have a good community.  Unwanted political advertisements contribute only to an uncomfortable living environment, especially since its not possible that everyone in our apartment supports the advertisements.

20120902 19:06:31 nbsp I lived at the Westgate Village Apartments in Woodland for about six months. The property was nice and the apartment was great, however, we had major problems with our AC. The maintenance guy came to check the unit (promptly) and told me everything was fine. However, our apartment was still boiling. It took four hours for the temp to drop three degrees. Several weeks later, I asked them to recheck the AC; they did and the problem was fixed. The same maintenance guy then told me that there was too much freeon in the unit and they had to drain some of it. When I asked him why he didnt catch this when I called them out weeks prior, blame was shifted to their previous AC maintenance person. My PG&E bill was ridiculously high due to their oversight during the time my AC unit was not working correctly. This was the only major problem we had while living at this apartment complex but it was enough to make us to move.  Users/ElizabethUrias

Hello Elizabeth,

Im sorry to hear of the frustration and discomfort you experienced with your AC repair. We do our best to quickly address and resolve maintenance issues for our residents. When completing a maintenance work order, we usually ask our residents to please tell us if the problem continues so we can readdress the concern. While most problems are remedied on the first visit, occasionally we do need to try a second time. Im sorry to hear of the miscommunication in your case. If youd like to follow up with me, Im happy to talk to you about having Tandem pay any resulting excessive PG&E charges. Had we known about your continuing problem or the higher charges to your electric bill, we happily would have worked to remedy things for you sooner. Our residents satisfaction and comfort is important to us. I apologize again for your experience. Please contact me at the Tandem main office, (530) 7565075, if youd like to discuss the PG&E reimbursement.

Take Care,

20130815 13:15:01 nbsp I have lived at a Tandem Properties residence for over six years now and have never had a positive experience regarding repairs or anything of the sort.  Elizabeths complaint below regarding the AC sounds all too familiar and seems to be Tandems MO for how they handle repairs and the overall poor treatment of their tenants.  I have to say the comments on this wiki page seem to be filtered and edited as though someone, Shari Houston or other Tandem employees, are privy to the many negative comments and are having these sad yet true comments taken down.  It is truly sad to see the locally famous Whitcombe family allow their celebrity to be linked to this sad excuse for a rental property.  I hope past commenters on this wiki page will speak up if they feel their comments have been unfairly redacted and i encourage people who have had a positive experience to comment below as well (although i suspect these individuals will be in the minority).

Hello TRipper,

Im sorry to hear of your frustrations with management during your tenancy. I am truly surprised and disappointed to hear that a sixyear resident would have anything other than a positive impression of Tandem. Because we do value feedback and want to be sure our tenants are heard, we do read and reply to comments left on review sites like Davis Wiki, but we do not filter (or have the ability to filter) or delete feedback left here. As we hope you can see from reading our responses to reviews left for all 14 of our properties, we deeply value our relationships with our tenants and always do our best to meet each residents needs. Im sorry if we have fallen short of that in any way during your time with us. I would very much like to know the details of your frustrations and which property and managers were involved. Please call me at (530) 7565075 to discuss your frustrations and allow me to see what I can do to make things better for you. Thank you in advance for sharing more details with meif I dont know of frustrations, I cannot work to fix them. My apologies again if we have ever not lived up to Tandems reputation for quality resident care. I hope we can work together to make you experience better in the future.

Sincerely,
Shari Houston
