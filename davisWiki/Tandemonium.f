20080116 00:14:33 nbsp I attended Tandemonium on January 15th and had an excellent time! Although there were some troubles with the buses and there was all the buzz about former president Clinton coming to the ARC, the Tandem guides kept it under control and pretty organized, and they were WILDLY energetic. Everyone working at the event and properties was really sweet, helpful, and enthusiastic, whether you were asking questions about units, or leaving a security deposit, (... or if you accidentally got left behind... ahem) whatever it was! The food, atmosphere, and people made it a fun and informational experience for me. Users/AmyChow
