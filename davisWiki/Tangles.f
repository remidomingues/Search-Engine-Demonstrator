As of June 15, 2009, Tangles is apparently closed. A new salon (?) called Strands is in its place.

Tangles was an upscale Hair Salons and Barber Shops salon/spa.  A fullservice cut (shampoo, cut, blowdry) was $50, but they also massaged your head, neck and shoulders with a really nicesmelling Aveda oil (unless you have color application).  This was an wiki:WikiPedia:Aveda Aveda salon, so they exclusively used and sold http://www.aveda.com/ Aveda products here, which are environmentally friendlygreat for Davis!  Aveda is the place to go when you really want a treat.

The spa offered massage therapy (relaxation, deep tissue, and hot stone, in 30, 60, 90 minutes), body wraps, facials, waxing, manicures, and pedicures.



  From therapy to pure relaxation, Davis offers a variety of Massage Services

20060524 16:09:41 nbsp I see a stylist named Kris every 6 weeks or so.  Shes great.  She helped me guide my difficult to style hair into a cut that Im really happy with.  She is warm and friendly and just seems to know when I want to talk and when I dont.  She has a daughter that comes to work with her sometimes that is extraordinarily cute and very wellmannered. I like the professional, yet family atmosphere.  Well worth every penny.   Users/SharlaDaly

20061005 12:31:13 nbsp I had to recut my hair when I got home, because it was noticeably longer on one side than the other. Bangs were cut much shorter than I asked for. WAY overpriced. I get a better cut at Great Clips. Users/AngelBug

20061218 10:52:36 nbsp Though I love Aveda products, this is a very inconsistent, overpriced salon. They had a great stylist named Angie months ago, whom both my husband and myself loved, but she was fired for unknown reasons and we were left without a stylist. Since then we have had our hair cut by other sytlists and have been disappointed in the quality of the haircuts weve received, especially for the high prices. My husbands recent haircutby one of the apprentice stylists that they say are goodlooks like a bad Supercuts haircut, yet he paid top dollar for it. Neither one of us plan to return and it is a shame because the owners seem really cool. They just need to hire better stylists and/or lower their prices! Users/GradStudent06

20070105 11:43:07 nbsp Ive always had excellent haircuts here.  My stylist is Ian, and I can recommend him.  He listens very carefully to what you tell him.  I agree its an expensive salon, but I feel confident that Ill look better when I leave than when I arrive, and that has not always been true at other places Ive been to, and it means a lot. Users/LynnetteWharton

20070212 14:05:28 nbsp I went here a year or so ago and saw someone who I think said he was the owner? I could be wrong. Anyway, it was AWFUL. He didnt tell me what he was going to do and proceeded to thin out my hair. I DID NOT want it thinned out. Also very expensive for a haircut that i didnt ask for. I was expecting more. Users/KatieStorer

20070214 23:51:52 nbsp 20060901 17:36:50 nbsp Natasha at Tangles (formerly at Hair Factory Too) is terrific. This is the only endorsement Ive posted on the wiki   Ive tried at least 20 different hairstylists in Davis over the years and Natasha is the best.  I just hope she doesnt raise her prices when she gets discovered. Users/JonFenske

20070215 01:37:56 nbsp I saw you going to get your haircut,  I wondered how it went Users/StevenDaubert

20070429 11:06:21 nbsp tangles was great! I had a woman named Marisa and she did a wonderful job. I showed her some pictures of what I wanted and she far exceeded my expectations. I got a shampoo, cut, blowdry, and she flat ironed my hair to show me how the choppy layers work. It is a bit pricey I must admit....but since this was my first time there with this new cut, Id say it was work the $45. Users/amanda

20070512 13:27:28 nbsp Before they moved to their newer location, I loved going to Tangles and my stylist was Ian; hes great, but the price is too steep for me! But Id still recommend him. At the new location I tried a massage, and the woman was awful! I went to relax, and instead got a very tense and unpleasant experience which cost a ton. She talked the ENTIRE time I was getting my massage, mostly about herself, and then said I had very bad skin that needed a special treatment (which costs $120) and that I should really book it right away. This is all while Im supposed to be relaxing! She then dumped a ton of peppermint oil on my back, and roughly rubbed it around leaving me burning and definitely not relaxed. I was completely disappointed and pissed, and when I sent in the evaluation and asked for refund, I didnt even get a response. That ruined my Tangles attachment. Users/AdrienneW

20070528 10:21:17 nbsp Ian at Tangles is fantastic he cut my hair exactly as I asked him to and hes a very pleasant person. He wasnt available for my second visit so I saw Natasha and really didnt get what I asked for at all, despite having brought a good photo of what I wanted. Also the middle aged red haired woman at the front desk (I think her name was Joni) was extremely rude to me, making excuses for inconveniences instead of apologizing for them not what Id expect from the most expensive salon in Davis. Upshot: will return, but for Ian only. Users/GSB

20070530 15:57:52 nbsp Ian is great. I always let him do whatever he wants to my hair color and cut & I always love it. You definitely get what you pay for. Users/AmLin

20070609 11:51:25 nbsp I just went to Tangles for the first time and saw a newer stylist named Larisa.  She did a great job on my hair with very little guidance.  I just described what I hated about my current cut (hadnt had it cut in a while) and she did the rest.  I am extremely happy with the end result and will be back to see her again!  $45 for the cut, and well worth it I might add.  If you expect to pay less, go to Greap Clips! Users/Alaga

20070613 16:22:11 nbsp I got a haircut from Kristie, and she gave me exactly what I asked for.  Granted, it was a pretty simple trim, but she cut off just the right amount and it looks good.  The haircut also comes with a shampoo and head and shoulder massage, so it was a nice experience.  $50 isnt bad for a good haircut either.   Users/LeslieCooper

20070825 19:33:12 nbsp Love this place!  Tea when you come in, a head rub before you get shampooed, and Aveda everywhere! Users/ElisaWeller

20070914 10:49:04 nbsp This is a great salon.  Very comparable to the Aveda salon I used to visit in Chicago when I lived in Illinois.  I got an excellent haircut, and my hair is very straight, so its quite obvious when the cut isnt right.  The stylist (Kara) did just what I asked her to do, she was very precise and took extra time to make sure it was perfect, and it also looked great the next day when I styled it myself (always an indication of a good cutof course the stylist can make it look good, but will it work for you?).  Im very picky about where I get my hair cut, and this place was great.  Ill be back! Users/CynthiaCCC

20070920 12:30:44 nbsp I LOVE TANGLES!!!!
i got the best haircut...i went from long frizzy damaged hair...to short and sleek
it was SOOOO cute
and everyone thinks im a hottie now!!! and the products smell good :) Users/ChristieKent

20071101 19:56:09 nbsp I have been to Tangles Three times, and I see a stylist named Kara...she is just a terrific stylist and person. I just love her. She gives me the best hair cuts I have ever had, and I have had a lot of them! My hair looks great even when i just wash and wear it, not even blowdried! She is unbelievable, I put some bleach on my hair to cover some gray and I messed it up, She fixed it in nothing flat and it looks just beautiful! Im telling you, you gotta go and try this stylist, you will love her! I just hope she doesnt go any where, and by the way, it is Worth the price, And the products are just Great! Users/Shelllie

20071125 19:41:15 nbsp I have been utterly impressed with Kara, one of the hair stylists at Tangles....  She took plenty of time to ask me what I wanted to achieve in a haircut and color, while also adding her suggestions.  She has an amazing eye for color and really sensed what I wanted in a hair cut.  I think she went the distance to make my hair unique and beautiful on ME.  I have red/chesnut hair and she did some highlights in all the perfect places.  She truly loves her jobyou can tell.  I am a senior woman who still likes to be updated and stylish; I know what I like in a color and cut and she delivers.  She is on time, gives a scalp massage when I get my hair cut, and always offers Aveda tea.  She has even run over to Starbucks for me when my color is processing!  WOW! Users/LynnL

20071222 11:22:03 nbsp After searching for 2 years I finally found a Davis hairdresser who listens to her customer and gives a wonderful haircut  Natasha at Tangles.  My hair hasnt looked this good in years and the neck and shoulder massage is wonderful! Users/sah133

20080225 18:33:52 nbsp I love Aveda products and used to work at an Aveda salon, but I will NEVER go back to Tangles after a series of bad experiences.  First it was an overpriced bad haircut. The final straw was the last time I went to get waxed.  The woman answered her cell phone while waxing me!!!  And had a conversation with her son on her blue tooth headset while putting hot wax on my bikini line!! Seriously, who does that? Of course the end result wasnt very good either, but what do expect with her only giving me half of her attention. So unprofessional  I will never go back! Users/smmc

20080307 17:53:53 nbsp Hello everyone its Ian,as most of you know I am no longer working at Tangles. I am now doing hair at Ninas Studio Ninas Studio the address is 241 F street its across the street from Bistro 33,the phone # is 5307589221.
I do miss my friends at Tangles but needed to move on to grow as a hair stylist and person.I am very excited to be at Ninas Studio so to all my clents I envite you to come and join me at Ninas Studio in downtown Davis..IAN  Users/IanN

20080314 13:57:30 nbsp I cannot stress how stongly I feel about Tangles. It makes me sick to think of the money I wasted. I had previously colored my hair black and I put my trust in a Tangles stylist to change it back. She gave me very bad advice and refused to put bleach on my hair. Instead she tried to lift color with more color (which is not possible) and the treatment did absolutely nothing. I saw some red highlights for the first week so I accepted it but those faded and the black came back. I would not recommend this salon to anyone as they are not knowledgeable or trustworthy. I hope this saves someone their 90 bucks... Users/Mclaire24

20080424 16:26:58 nbsp I have had my hair cut twice now by Alyssa.  I highly recommend her.  Shes really talented & meticulous, she does a fabulous job.  I just had her do a big job  cutting lon hair short, & it looks really great. Users/Dora5

20080527 17:49:03 nbsp  I have naturally curly, thick hair and have always wanted straight.  Alas, finally learned to love what I have which is made possible by Aveda hair products and someone who knows how to cut curly hair.  I have seen Kara a Tangles for a year now and she doesnt try to make you look like your dream hair.  She takes the hair you HAVE and makes it dream hair.  Go Kara!  And thank you for making me love my curls! Users/Kristy894

20081007 15:28:00 nbsp GREAT HAIRCUT! they gave me a short but free massage before my hair was washed and cut. Love the cut, I went in their with only a description and Jamie listened and spent time doing exactly what I asked for. I also got my eyebrows waxed by Nicole and they look great. I will definitely be going back there. IT is $50 for a haircut, shampoo and style. A little expensive for a college student but well worth it!! Users/Ldish949

20081114 13:59:51 nbsp The WORST hair service I have ever had. Could have done my hair color better myself from a box. Went to someone named Jamie. Heard good things but changed ownership and now called Strands. Users/LaurenL

20090331 17:37:59 nbsp I went to Tangles (Strands) for the first time today and was VERY disappointed. I showed Amber, my stylist, about four pictures of what I liked and four pictures of what I DIDNT like, so that she could have a great idea of what I wanted her to do. She seemed to be paying no attention to what I was showing her, just nodding her head. I told her I was very picky, and she didnt even tell me what she was planning to do, after I repeatedly asked her questions about what it would look like.  I had previously had super streaky highlights, so I asked her to tone down the streakyness of those.  She that that very well, but my hair is basically back to brown now, with the streaky highlights that she added on the top. I had a few very blonde highlights before that had some major brown roots, and she didnt even cover them up! She tried to put a low light over them, but she guesses it didnt take. I didnt want a low light AT ALL because I told her I am trying to get my hair increasingly LIGHTER! I made another appointment to go back in two days to have her fix it, and if she charges me I will be so mad. She needs to fix the mistakes she made. Users/AnnaGarzon

20090331 17:39:14 nbsp Also, Amber didnt give me the head and shoulders massage that they advertise. Very very disappointing. Users/AnnaGarzon
