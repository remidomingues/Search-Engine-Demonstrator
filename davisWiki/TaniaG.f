Things TaniaG is Not Fond of Just Now

  Drizzle



Languages
TaniaG has a tentative grasp on a few languages besides English. She speaks Spanish fluently (its her home language). In high school, she studied French enough to understand French Wikipedia, some of http://www.lemonde.fr Le Monde, and a good deal of radio news, but she still gets lost with movie dialog (the lines are short and if she misses a few words, comprehension goes down significantly, unfortunately). She took a quick introductory course to German before college; she remembers short sentences like Ich bin TaniaG and Das ist ein Buch and some grammar. She recognizes very basic words in Japanese (you can sometimes find her in Davis Anime Club). She still remembers the American Sign Language alphabet from elementary school. She can also write in the Mayan/Aztec number system.

Math
MAT 16 vs MAT 21/22: TaniaG took MAT16BC, then decided to continue with the later half of the MAT 21 series, then with MAT 22AB. Heres her comparison: MAT 16 teaches less material, but it teaches it well. The idea (she thinks) behind MAT 16 is that the students will not take more math classes, so they should really understand the concepts before they leave. The homework in MAT 16 has a lot more word problems to test students problem solving skills. MAT 21/22 is more rushed and more focused on giving students proofs. The homework in MAT 21/22 is more straightforward do this problems. The idea (she thinks) behind MAT 21/22 is that students are going to need this math in future courses, so they should be introduced to all the concepts before they leave.

Course advice: If any science majors who took the MAT 16 series want to expand their math skills without taking MAT 21CD, TaniaG recommends MAT 22A (its just linear algebra, i.e. matrix algebra, and has nothing to do with the MAT 21 series) and BIS 132 (Biological Modeling with Dr. Carole Hom... very nice professor). They are challenging classes, but you learn plenty. MAT 22A is useful because MAT 16 doesnt directly cover matrices (you solve systems of equations in MAT 16, which is the whole idea behind matrices, but thats about it). BIS 132 is useful because it applies the math to the science and introduces common models like the SIR model of disease spread. TaniaG also suggests that science majors take STA 100 instead of STA 13. Its easier than calculus, dont worry. If you know how to find averages and standard deviations (basic analysis from the CHE 2 labs), and you took MAT 16B, you are qualified to take STA 100. You will be bored in STA 13.

By the way, the Learning Skills Center workshops are amazing! Take advantage. If your teacher confuses you, the LSC staff unconfuses you. They are so smart and so nice. The Calculus Room in the Mathematical Sciences Building is also a great resource for MAT 16.

Science
Electives she took that she particularly liked: MIC 102 w/ Appleman (general microbiology, mostly bacteria and archaea biology and metabolism), MIC 170 w/ Shiozaki (yeast genetics, useful eukaryote genetics class generally), BIS 132 w/ Hom (biological models, including disease spread and population models).

The comments above about the LSC workshops apply here, too, for general and organic chemistry. Such useful workshops!

TaniaG was in STEP (EOP), the Biology Undergraduate Scholars Program (science/EOP), CLIMB (science/math), and the McNair Scholars Program (pregraduate). If you have questions about any of these programs, feel free to ask. TaniaG likes to sit in student panels and give advice to younger students, partially out of gratitude for the advice that she herself received.





20071203 21:55:41 nbsp I like Tania.  Shes cuddly.   Users/BreeButler

20080320 21:41:37 nbsp You like BIS 103?!  That is definetly hardcore.  I took that class SEVEN years ago and I still havent gotten over the trauma! Users/CurlyGirl26

20080321 20:18:22 nbsp Im glad you like BIS 103!  Its a good class and so is the subject matter.  I had a horrible prof. and the exams were just ridiculous so Im just still bitter! Users/CurlyGirl26

20080329 12:42:44 nbsp Well, my favorite science class was Endocrinology (NPB 130 when I took it) and people thought I was nuts so I feel ya. Users/CurlyGirl26

20080429 20:15:27 nbsp I wonder if its possible to piece together a picture of your face using the snippets that you allow us to see online.  Im reminded of The Truman Show... Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080430 14:49:57 nbsp Since Ive been working downtown forever and am constantly known as that bookstore guy or hey book dude, Ive pretty much given up on caring about not being recognized by people I dont know...especially since most of the people that know me I usually dont know...

20080830 09:25:19 nbsp Fun mask! Users/JabberWokky

20080909 20:00:25 nbsp You also might want to cross link them to Spiritual Organizations for people looking for similar groups that arent UCD based. Users/JabberWokky

20081007 19:03:11 nbsp We should go food. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20081009 13:50:12 nbsp Perhaps, but we should go cook doesnt work the same if you think of ok, time to cook because ok, time to food has a different meaning.  Of course we should go cook has another meaning to it if you think along the lines of now were cooking! Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20091009 19:38:58 nbsp Isnt Kaplan still around? Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20100528 01:36:21 nbsp Are you still in Davis? Sorry for the late notice, but maybe you would like to come have sushi with some wiki people tomorrow (Friday). Its at 1 at Davis Sushi Buffet. Users/NickSchmalenberger
