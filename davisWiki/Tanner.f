20090418 16:16:38 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. I saw your edit to Matthews Mattress and that someone else had removed it. Rather than mentioning your business on their page, how about going to wiki:vacaville Vacaville Wiki and creating a listing for your business? You can use interwiki linking {{{wiki:vacaville:pagename}}} to link from nearby wikis if your link is topical and appropriate. Also please read Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner; it will help explain how you can make the wiki a positive experience for you without clashing with established wiki social norms.

20090419 17:44:06 nbsp Your use of the word We probably was what gave the impression that you were part of the other business. Dont worry too much about it, every page is the result of collaboration. Users/JasonAller
