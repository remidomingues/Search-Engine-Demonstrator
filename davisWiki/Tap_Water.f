You know the saying, Dont drink the water? Some people feel that Davis tap Water water is some of the wiki:WikiPedia:Hard Water hardest, most metallictasting, most &#8220;flavorful&#8221; water you may have ever tried. Yet Davis water is still much better than many of the water sources people are stuck with elsewhere in the world. So be grateful for what you have, Lamas filter it, buy drinking water bottled water or get some tea (which, incidentally, is what much of the rest of the world has to do).

City Water water comes from 22 Davis Water Wells wells at depths of 3001800 feet, http://www.ci.davis.ca.us/pw/water/WellLocations.cfm located throughout the city; the water is filtered naturally by sand and gravel as it passes through the aquifers. The only treatment administered by the city is the addition of wiki:WikiPedia:sodium hypochlorite (chlorine) at .2ppm.  Davis tap water is not optimally Water Fluoridation fluoridated. If the Conaway Ranch Joint Powers Authority received ownership of the ranch by eminent domain, tap water would not have come from wells anymore, but from the Sacramento River to which the property owner has riparian rights. UC Davis The university taps a deeper wiki:WikiPedia:aquifer than most wells in the city and tastes a little bit better due to its having fewer contaminants.  Davis tap water is very alkaline with a pH close to 8. See also http://cityofdavis.org/meetings/councilpackets/20110301/06%20Proposition%20218%20Approval%20Water,%20Sewer%20&%20Sanitation.pdf 06 Proposition 218 Approval Water, Sewer & Sanitation.pdf from the March 1, 2011 City Council meeting about rate increases related to the Woodland Davis Clean Water Agency.

Much of Davis water system is currently out of federal complicance according to Jacques DeBra, the Utilities Director for the Public Works Department of Davis, as reported in a http://www.kcra.com/news/28414257/detail.html KCRA article. In September 2011, the City Council will decide on whether or not to construct a system to import water from the Sacramento River. The project would cost Davis about 160 million dollars and, according to an official estimate, could effectively triple the average water bill for each residence and business over the next few years. In addition, if the plan goes through, some city officials have expressed interest in possibly adding fluoride supplementation to the system.

Public water in the United States is guaranteed by the federal government to be the safest water available.  It is checked against strict standards more than once per week at every water source feeding into the public system.  Bottled water manufacturers are not subject to such strict regulations and the most popular brands of bottled water have been found in independent tests to contain several times the amounts of the most toxic chemicals found in United States federally regulated public water.  If you are worried about adverse health effects from drinking water, please note:
 1. The regulations noted above
 2. Water consumption is necessary to continue human life
 3. Bottling water uses the next two most valuable resources to western humanity less efficiently: petroleum and energy

 Whats in this stuff? 
The City of Davis publishes http://www.city.davis.ca.us/pw/water/WaterQuality.cfm statistics in the form of Annual Water Quality Reports on city drinking water annually and distributes these to every household within the city. The Annual Water Quality Report is broken down by regulated standards (health related), nonregulated standards (taste, odor & appearance), and unregulated substances. Davis water is well within regulations and does not even come close to violating ANY health standards. However, as far as the unregulated goes, some feel the ratings could use improvement. In summary, its not the tastiest water around, but there are no known long term health consequences.

According to the http://www.city.davis.ca.us/aboutdavis/cityprofile/index.cfm?topic2 City of Davis profile:BR
 Generally, Davis groundwater is very hard and high in dissolved solids. wiki:WikiPedia:Selenium Selenium and wiki:WikiPedia:Nitrate nitrates are two primary substances found in Davis tap water. Selenium is a natural element in the soil which may dissolve into groundwater and nitrates are chemicals that may occur from agricultural irrigation and cultivation of the soil due to fertilizers or leaching of water from septic systems. Both selenium and nitrate levels at all city wells are below the maximum standards set by federal and/or state agencies. Long term development of water wells over 1,500 feet deep is planned to improve the aesthetic characteristics of Davis water.

TDS(total dissolved solids)
050 PPM                    Ideal drinking water(microfiltration, reverse osmosis)
50140 PPM                Often considered acceptable range for carbon filtration, mountain springs or aquifers.
140400 PPM              Average tap water.
170 PPM or above      Hard water.
200300 PPM          Less desirable
300500 PPM        Unpleasant levels from tap water, aquifers or mountain springs.
500 PPM          The EPAs maximum contamination level.

and in this page from a City of Davis/UC Davis Joint http://www.city.davis.ca.us/pw/water/watersupply/index.cfm?topic4 Water Supply Feasibility Study:

 Water from the intermediate depth wells is generally very hard (high wiki:WikiPedia:Calcium calcium level) and high in total dissolved solids. Nitrate levels are close to the drinking water limit in several wells and required abandonment of well 16. Boron levels are high enough to adversely affect sensitive plants, but not high enough to adversely affect human health. Arsenic and hexavalent chromium levels are relatively low, but may exceed future drinking water limits. Selenium concentrations are sufficiently high to cause problems at the City&#8217;s wastewater treatment plant, but are below drinking water limits.

 Water from the deep aquifer has moderate levels of hardness and total dissolved solids. Available information indicates that boron, hexavalent chromium, and selenium are not problematic constituents. Arsenic levels do not exceed current drinking water limits, but may exceed future limits for this constituent.


 Figure C and Figure D compare water quality of various water supply sources. In general, intermediate depth wells provide the lowest water quality for most parameters, and treated surface water from the Sacramento River is the highest water quality. Deep aquifer water quality generally lies between these two sources and represents an opportunity to improve system water quality in the near future.

But you dont need us to quote everything already posted on the city pages, right? Links are included so you can read all the most recent materials yourself! Suffice it to say that some people have no problems with the tap water and others have big issues with it. Youll have to make your own decision.

 New information: 
According to the most recent water quality reports, the level of chromium6 or hexavalent chromium http://cityofdavis.org/pw/water/Chromium.cfm in the water are higher than the Oral Maximum Allowable Dose Level for Developmental and Reproductive Toxicity set by OEHHA http://oehha.ca.gov/prop65/law/071511Cr6.html. The NDRC states that, â€œIngesting hexavalent chromium causes stomach and intestinal damage and can lead to cancer. In lab animals, hexavalent chromium damages sperm and male reproductive systems, and in some cases, has damaged the developing fetus http://www.nrdc.org/living/chemicalindex/hexavalentchromium.asp.

There are also current warnings for boron http://cityofdavis.org/pw/water/boron.cfm. Pregnant women are advised not to drink the water.


After a night of hard drinking, Davis water is downright wonderful. Relax and enjoy it. &#8212;ct

My geology teacher was pretty convinced that it was a pretty poor idea to drink Davis Tap Water... but my Nutrition teacher claims that its not bad for you and possibly has minerals that are good for you. Personally I dont mind it that much. Users/MichaelGiardina

20050704 10:20:54 nbsp No, fluoride really is toxic.  Its not as toxic as lead, but is close in toxicity.  Its basically banned throughout Europe.  Ever wonder why fluoride toothpaste has all those warnings on it? Users/JaimeRaba
    This isnt, and wasnt, accurate at all. It is _not_ banned in Europe, its simply used differently.  Thats just a myth.  Fluoride use has been universally shown to prevent tooth decay and help with cavity prevention.  Theres differing methods of treatment though, which Jaime only partially touched on.  We mostly use iodized salt in the US to help prevent iodine deficiencies (which lead to goiter (thyroid), and mental retardation).  Fluoridation of the water is pretty much the same thing, just done differently.  And while isnt neccessarily done everywhere, in Europe many countries use fluoridated salt, specifically France and Germany. Likewise, Europe also had more readily available fluoridated toothpastes over the last few decades.  (The idea being, super simplified, socioeconomic boundries were different in the US, prompting water as a better method to reach those in need). Interestingly enough many countries, even the UK, have fluoridated milk! Its aimed towards children. Many of the antifluoridation crowd (in general) spread fear based on toxicity, imo. I think the real issue for many people is whether its intrusion; the safety and effectiveness isnt that controversial within the fields at all. And most people I think dont really understand the strength and amount of evidence (as opposed to disbelieving it).  It flies in the face of science and all the practical effects and studies over decades, worldwide. Unfortunately, this type of thing usually happens in the general public.  Users/Edwins ES

20050820 13:23:31 nbsp Maybe its because I grew up in New Jersey and lived near Philly for a while  but I think Davis tap water is pretty tasty.  No problems making bread with it. Users/BlancheNonken

   20061127 08:54:59 nbsp Well...http://www.mercola.com/2001/sep/22/arsenic_water.htm government ideas of safety change, so I dont think its actually funny.  Clinton set a limit on the amount of arsenic in water, that Bush wanted to suspend.  Clinton said 10 parts per billion...before him the EPA had it to 50..  Bush officials wanted to raise it to 20 and it caused quite some news back then ( I believe research showed that would >> cancer rates). And especially because WHO and stuff said 10 is the max as well.  And this is just one chemical/compound out of very many.  As JaimeRaba brought up above, the rest of the world differs on flouride as well (even banning it).  So, was it potentially unsafe for the last 40 years before Clinton?  According to public record: no.  So, is it really safe just because this government says its under some limit? Users/EdWins ES

20070512 22:47:07 nbsp On the first day of school one year, my Biology Professor brought out a huge enterolith. Basically it was like a giant white rock hard kidney stone like ball that was surgically removed from a dead cow that had drunk nothing but Davis Water. It was bigger than the guys hands. From that day on I never drank Davis Tap Water again.

(However, the professor told us that the cow got the enterolith because cows only eat grass. Humans eat other foods which turn into acid and therefore we dont get enteroliths. Arent you glad humans dont eat grass all day long?) Users/Jedron

20070911 08:34:17 nbsp I just moved here 2 weeks ago and (like always) drink water religiously. A couple of things I will say:

1. I have not been fully hydrated since moving here, as evidenced by the color of my urine. This is a problem posed by the amount of dissolved solids in the water keeping my body from absorbing everything.

2. I just discovered a giant gaping cavity/crater in the side of one of my teeth. Granted, my family has a genetic history of teeth problems, I have no doubt that this is because there is no fluoride in the water and my body is adjusting to that change. I hope it will resolve itself because my student dental insurance doesnt start for a few weeks! Im just gonna go to town on the listerine and try to stop consuming so much sugar... Users/sweetMeliss
  I doubt that the small levels of dissolved solids will prevent you from absorbing the water. If you just discovered a cavity in your teeth, that couldnt possibly be due to the absence of fluoride in your drinking water after just 2 weeks. Cavities can take a long time to develop. You could always get one of those fluoride rinses from your dentist to use once every week or two, to go along with brushing and flossing.  Users/KarlMogel KJM
    I took fluoride pills when I was young till a certain age due to the lack of fluoride in the water.  Users/StevenDaubert
       This is good advice. I have a history of bad teeth and if I neglect them for even a few days I can notice the difference, so this was a special case for me. Also, my dad is a groundwater geologist and I consulted with him a few weeks after writing my comment above. He assured me that the water here is fine. Ive been using a filter for drinking water just for my own peace of mind.

20071101 16:10:16 nbsp i have to say, Davis water is pretty variable in taste and alkalinity/hardness/pH (ive noticed because i test the water for my fish tank regularly). that said, today my brita filtered water tastes like crap, though the past month its been reasonably tasteless. but compared to my hometown its great, where the water tastes as chlorinated as pool water. to each his or her own.

20080905 10:39:16 nbsp Davis water is like 1942.  When Rommels tank columns first broke Montgomerys desert rats at El Agheila and hundreds of soldiers were overrun, finding themselves alone in a scorching desert behind enemy lines.  The sounds of Tiger and Panzer tanks roaring through the desert, rarely seen, but potentially always over the next dune.  Scampering from hole to hole, hoping that each time you wont be cut down by a Bavarian behind a pintlemounted .30 machinegun.  You finally find a oasis, having discarded everything but some ration bars, your canteen and your trusty .303.  You plunge your canteen in the water and bring it to your sunburned lips only to see that the Libyan irregulars Rommel has commandeered have machinegunned an entire captured platoon of your British brethren and left them to rot in the oasis for several days.  You look at them.  And then you drink.  Because it is the only way to live.

Davis water really isnt that bad. In Winters, for instance, there is a drinking fountain in the community theater off Main Street. I performed there many times as a child, and learned VERY quickly to bring my own water rather than drinking out of it. The water was so hard it made me thirstier! And actually, Ive found that, perhaps out of force of habit, filtered water tends to slake my thirst less than good old Davis tap... I think I miss the taste. Users/KBathory

20100930 02:56:58 nbsp O.K., so both my roommate and I are from the Bay Area. Weve lived in Davis for the past few weeks and we BOTH are having huge amounts of hair fall out upon showering. So after a few days of having major anxiety that I had some autoimmune disease that was causing my usually thick hair to become thin and brittle, my roommate related a very interesting story to me that essentially tied all of this together:

She went to get her hair trimmed at a local salon. The hairdresser noticed large amounts of hair coming out of her scalp when she was being shampooed. The hairdresser told my roommate that the volume of hair being shed was not normal, and later told her that this was probably caused by showering in Davis water.

EW.

Concerns about my impending health were slightly eased when I heard this story, but now I am equally mortified and will drop a significant amount of money on a water purifier for my shower.

Until then, I will be washing my hair with the water from the Brita filter jug.

Its either that or my hair is falling out because I have a disease. And my roommate does too.
