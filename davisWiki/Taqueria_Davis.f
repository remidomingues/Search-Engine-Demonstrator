Taqueria Davis is one of the many Latin American Restaurant Guide Mexican restaurants to be found in Davis. Husband and wife work together to run the place. Both are extremely welcoming and kind people. Regulars are greeted with a Hi, Hon! as they walk up to the counter, and the owners know most regulars by name.  As with most Mexican restaurants in the area, their burritos are pretty popular. The food and salsa are generally considered to be above par for the area. Prices, however, are above average as well.  Check out their cabeza if youre daring, which is the meat from the head. They used to serve cesos (beef brains), but ceased by 2006 because of wiki:wikipedia:mad cow disease concerns.

They recently redecorated the restaurant, painting the walls, putting up loads of new art, hanging drapes, and so on.  The atmosphere is great, and the music is generally at a low but pleasant level.  They seem to have hired a couple more people to help out, perhaps because theyve got significantly longer hours than they used to.

If you want a California burrito that is bigger, just get a super with potato. They also have a vegan burrito: your choice of pinto or black beans, grilled veggies, veggie rice, lettuce, guacamole, and pico de gallo ($6.25 + tax).

Taqueria Davis Happy Hour Food happy hour deal used to be among the best in Davis. See Discounts and Freebies and Cheap Food.

I had one of their vegetarian burritos ($4.90) for lunch today. It was beyond large, it was Extra Large. Then again, it was mostly rice. I asked if their horchata ($1.50) was from a mix, and she said they make it from scratch (no hydrogenated fat!), so I had one: delicious.  Users/SteveDavison

20050303 20:01:56 nbsp The owners are very nice here. Not every mexican place has employees that all refer to you as amigo. Their happy hour is worth a visit Users/DaneBehrens

20050309 01:03:00 nbsp I had a super burrito w/chicken ($6.25) and, until then, never realized anyone could make a burrito so greasy that it dripped oil. Users/AndrewChen

20050509 17:37:41 nbsp The burritos are better than Guadalajaras, and in the evening you can get a burrito in 510 minutes versus 40 at Guadalajara in north Davis. Well, except during happy hour, but thats only twice a week for an hour. Users/TomHinds

20050630 16:37:56 nbsp Its not on the menu, but try an order of Mexico City Tacos  chicken and pineapple with melted cheese and put some of their homemade green salsa on there. Amazingly good! You can also buy their salsa to go in cups, I highly reccomend the green. Users/DanFisher

20050630 16:55:55 nbsp I remember going to Taqueria Davis maybe 5 years ago when I was visiting my cousin who attended UCD at the time.  We had burritos, and they were good.  Yippy! Users/SummerSong

20050822 21:03:00 nbsp I have eaten here many times. The food has always been excellent and the people very friendly. Highly recommended. Users/PaulThober

20050909 01:02:35 nbsp They have lengua (cow tongue) and its DELICIOUS!!! (If youre daring...) Users/EddieKim

20051225 18:43:12 nbsp The address is not completely correct need suite # Users/SteveDavison

20051231 17:12:07 nbsp This is by far my favorite mexican restaurant in Davis. It is the most authentic at least in terms of the variety of food they serve; including seviche, menudo, lengua, cabeza etc.  I completely agree about the Mexico city tacos, theyre awesome!! And unless you are sharing it with another person, want the other half for dinner or are a UCD football player, dont order a super burrito: its unlikely youll finish it!!! A regular burrito is plenty... The beef or pork is much better than their chicken so just order one of those two meats instead...  Users/HaleaMeese

20060410 01:51:48 nbsp while the chicken is indeed greasy, and probably only about as good as guads chicken burrito, its completely irrelevant because of the fact that their steak burritos are good enough that i would consider taking everything else off the menu. Users/IanLumley

20060426 12:11:48 nbspMy buddy Greg used to live down the street so I went there a few times. The owners are very nice and friendly and the service is good.  Unfortunately I was not very happy with the food, The Al Pastor was less than great, the chips did not come free unless you spent a certain amount of money, the chips were not homemade and sometimes stale, and the salsas were boring.  I would stick with El Mariachi.  Users/HaggroAlex

20060516 23:49:20 nbsp Hands down, the best place in Davis for a burrito.  It is worth the extra $1 compared to other establishments.  The salsa is awesome and the horchata is even better.  One night they let me sit and enjoy my meal even though they were already closed. Users/JoAnnaRich

20060828 16:42:54 nbsp Today was my first experience with TD.  I had the lunch special  the QueTaco Plate for $6.50.  It was extremely tasty and I found the friendliness factor just as high as everyone here claims.  Yay! for Taqueria Davis. Users/JamesShearer

20060916 19:12:54 nbsp It should be noted that they stopped serving cesos a couple of years ago due to the mad cow scare.  At least, thats what they told me when I asked them if they still sold em. Users/StephenHo

20061021 12:20:05 nbsp The salsa bar is pretty weak Users/AlJean

20061021 15:03:42 nbsp Umm... they dont have a salsa bar, they have two bowls of salsa. Users/ChebaccoThirty

20080212 15:03:42 nbsp Umm... I feel compelled to mention that I adore the red salsa. Users/drpottsiv

20061107 18:49:22 nbsp I only started going here about a year ago, but I refuse to eat mexican anywhere else in Davis now.  Thursday dollar taco night is a blast, the tacos are delicious and 1.50 imported beers are hard to beat.  The salsa bar may be meager but the two salsas they have are fantastic.  The green avacado salsa is my favorite.  Also, I reccomend the california burrito (Meat, cheese, potatoes!!!, pico, guac).  To my knowledge, Taqueria Davis is the only place that serves one. Users/DaveBanister

20061126 16:51:00 nbsp So all all sorts of things have already been said, but Id just like to second that their burritoes are excellent.  I definitely prefer them to Guadalajaras.  Also while the owners/people running the places seem nice enough at both, they have definitely always been much more friendly here.   Users/BobbyGray

20061212 21:42:42 nbsp This place is gross.  I ate there recently and ordered the California Burrito, which made my stomach turn.  This place tastes like greasy texmex.  I am used to Taqueria Guadalajara and just decided to try something new.... from now on Ill stick to Taqueria Guadalajara. Users/AmandaAbughosh

20061214 nbsp  Ive been here before.  Their horchata is very good from what I recall, but their burrito was somewhat lacking.  Boo.   Users/ClaytonRehmus

20070103 08:48:04 nbsp Does anyone know if the rice and beans are veg?  Im guessing with all the meaty bits like brains that they use the traditional manteca (lard). Users/ScottWeintraub

20070122 20:28:00 nbsp Probably the best burritos in Davis. The only real downside to the place is their limited salsa bar. I really wish they had some pico de gallo. Their green salsa is awesome, however. :) Users/WilliamLewis

20070213 13:04:27 nbsp I think this is the best Mexican food in town. Not only does the meat not have bones in it like Guadalajara, but the service is very friendly and the atmosphere is mellow.   Users/GabeDavis

20070223 15:23:44 nbsp The owners are extremely friendly and always happy, which is why I try to go to Happy Hour every Thursday. The tacos taste as amazing as the customer service.  Users/DanielSong

20070524 22:16:55 nbsp Food is average tasting.  I am not sure what the big deal is for this place beside the happy hour thing, but that was a bit disappointing as well.  I have tried a carnitas torta.  Even though the pork tasted pretty good, the sandwich is expensive and not worth it.  During happy hour, I tried steak, chorizo, and pastor tacos.  Chorizo is quite good, definitely flavorful.  I have mixed feelings about the pastor meat.  The steak is pretty generic to me.  I am not sure what makes the Sol beer good, but it was ok.  The horchata is quite good, so that gives the place a bit of value. Users/DavidTran

20070601 12:39:00 nbsp I believe the Thursday night beers have raised in price, can anyone verify?  Last time I went I think I saw $1.50 domestic $2 mex Users/KyleLanderhoffis
  Yes, confirmed, and now changed above.  Users/DougWalter

20070719 15:32:38 nbsp Good food of course i always complain the only thing this place needs is more meet on there items other wise good food Users/dickjones

20070826 15:46:53 nbsp Where do I begin?  The owners are so kind, very familyoriented.  Sometimes when I come in, they make me wait a long time because they cook something up special for me and chat me up for 30 minutes.  I dont mind the wait, tho, they make a fabulous burrito. Users/ElisaWeller

20070912 10:56:53 nbsp the lady at the counter is super friendly, the green salsa is super delicious, and the food was super tasty. all in all, a super place.  Users/JillBenciWoodward

20070920 21:36:37 nbsp Ive waited a while to contribute to this but can wait no longer.  Ive been eating at TD for over 8 years and its been fabulous always.  First off.  A little editorializing.  These restaurants we review arent nonprofits.  Theyre small businesses, often owned by individuals and families.  You ever seen someone come into a mexican place and gorge on bowl after bowl of FREE chips?  Who do you think pays for that?  Why shouldnt an owner set boundaries on what they give for free?

Okay.  Enough of that.  On to TDs food. Their carnitas are the best in the REGION...not just Davis...the region.  Im on the road a lot and hit taquerias all over.  TD marinates the pork for hours, maybe even a whole day.  They grill it up fresh on the griddle when you order it.  When it comes to you, the meat is tender on the inside, carmelized and crusty on the outside, with a piquant, garlicky, tangy, flavor that will knock your socks off.  The Chili Colorado is also awesome.  Tender flavorful chunks of pork in a rich, deep red, spicy and complex sauce.  Ditto for the Chili Verde when they have it. Tender pork chunks that are similarly flavorful like the carnitas but smothered in a great chili and tomatilla sauce.  The Pastor is delicious.  A blend of BBQ and smokey chili flavors on tender, marinated little pork strips.  Go to any other mexican restaurant and order Pastor and I guarantee you will get gristle and rinds in the mix.  Ive NEVER had anything but delicious cuts of meat in the Pastor from TD.  To top it all off, they offer daily specials that are authentic mexican meals and the owners (Tarcisio and Sarah) are just the nicest people in the world.  Kind, friendly, caring and dedicated.  Youll NEVER find cheap restaurant labor that doesnt give a damn about your meal.  This is Davis mexican food version of Cheers.  Everyone knows your name and theyre (and youre) glad you came.  Seriously, this place is SOOOOOO much better than the others.  It really is.  Ill admit that Mariachi has a great green mole and a huge salsa list but TD still beats them all on quality and flavors. Users/mediator

20071010 15:47:18 nbsp I went there today and ordered two tacos, and I ended up getting three by accident, my order and another persons were mixed up. I ate all three and they were so good I went up to pay for the extra, and the woman at the counter told me I didnt have to pay for their mistake. They were carnitas tacos and they were delicious! Their tacos are just like the ones from my favorite place in my hometown, Im definitely going back again soon. Probably for their happy hour. Users/EmyFargey

20071011 21:35:36 nbsp This place is wonderful. The burritos are huge and worth the five bucks. And the chips and salsa are eternally flowing. Wonderful service. I suggest it. Users/RobRoy

20071023 01:51:15 nbsp I came here recently, curious to see if there would ever be a burrito in Davis that compares to Guads.  When I entered, the first thing I noticed was that the prices were pretty high for mexican food.  However, when I got my burrito, I was very pleasantly surprised.  The burrito was plump, almost completely full, and it had a ton of meat  it almost makes up for the price difference.  This is unlike Guads, who tend to give a lot of beans/rice, and whose burritos sometimes sink in to themselves.  Also, Taqueria Davis seems to toast their tortillas a little, which makes them pretty tasty.  I would personally say that TD and Guads are tied for the best burrito in Davis. Users/BrandonWong

20071024 19:24:58 nbsp Wonderful service and super veggie burrito, and fast and friendly service.  Dont forget to leave a tip! Users/Casey

20071106 00:11:30 nbsp Its really nice to know that when I miss the food Id eat at home I could walk 3 blocks and get it here rather than make that 45 hour trip home.  They are really awesome here and make sure that your order is right. Users/GregWebb

20071109 19:14:56 nbsp My friends and I have been coming here religously for about 5 years.  Sarah and her husband are the sweetest people.  They know us all by name and order.  I recommend the carnitas in anything, but mostly in a crunchy taco, they are the best I have ever had, also the super quesedilla and the ceviche are tastey.  They are by far my favorite taqueria! Users/cfm

20071110 12:58:26 nbsp I came here with a friend to have lunch. The service is super friendly, owner really wants to make you feel welcomed. I ordered a regular chicken burrito and all I have to say is that it was absolutely delicious. The burrito was packed with meat which was tender, juicy, and flavorful with this great red sauce they use. They even have all you can eat chips now which dont tear up your mouth like Gauds chips. However, their burritos seemed small in comparison to Guads, leaving me still pretty hungry afterwards. They dont have a lot of salsa variety either. Prices are a little higher than Guads too. If you cant eat that much and got the cash, this is the place to go. Wonderful service and food, questionable portion and price.

After going to Gauds recently and being disappointed, I realized I no longer know what a big burrito is. I retract my statement saying that this place has smaller burritos than Guads. Users/CoreyPham

20071114 12:12:40 nbsp I love this place!! The owners and so friendly and the food is delicious. They have an ultra spicy hot sauce which goes great w/the california burrito.  Users/YuanNiu

20071129 15:23:33 nbsp Best burritoes in Davis by far, tied for best (and friendliest) restaurant owners in Davis as well (with Sam @ Sams). I must try the ultra spicy sauce. I didnt know and Ive eaten here many many many times! Also, the red Salsa is absolutely amazing. Users/William.Peacock

20071202 09:14:56 nbsp Just thought I would let everyone know there is now a online menu which I created for Taqueria Davis, it is located @ http://taqueriadavis.awardspace.com Users/dnm12

20080125 22:06:12 nbsp This is much more than a food establishment. Its like family! No question the best carnitas in town, in county, etc, etc. Mexico City tacos are unique and delicious. Dont do the big burrito thing much anymore, but the California Burrito (con carnitas) is out of this world. Thank you Tarcis and Sarah! Users/DavidFeliz

20080212 14:15:02 nbsp Friendly service, delicious food.  If you want Mexican food in Davis, you should not miss this place. Users/drpottsiv

20080313 20:59:58 nbsp One of the most friendliest owners in town.  I am always greeted with a smile.  Ive only tried the Californian burrito, but man, it is good!  Once I get tired of it, perhaps Ill try something else.  This restaurant is on the pricier side, but well worth it if you have money or only eat out occasionally.   Users/BenLee

20080406 21:53:32 nbsp The people working here are so friendly and always happy to see repeat customers. The food is so good too, authentic mexican. I love this place, I just wish they were open later hours on Saturday and open on Sunday. Users/WendyWoo

20080411 21:48:05 nbsp just went here tonight and I have been missing out!  this place is great.  regular burrito with steak and sour cream (oh my godsour cream!) is amazing.  The couple that run this place are wonderful.  burritos rival guads, maybe even better.  highly recommended! Users/ericaSbutnotreally

20080422 23:38:33 nbsp sarah and tarcicio (i dunno how to spell his name...) are super friendly (i cant count how many times ive heard hey brudda! said to loyal customers as they come in) and their food is unbelievable. crunchy pastor tacos! and their salsa is great too. very modest selection, 1 red and 1 green, but id take their salsa over any other place that gives out 10 different variations of watery tasteless crap. sometimes i go on $1 taco night, but i order the regular tacos anyway cuz i think theyre worth it. and the mexico city tacos are awesome! thank you DanFisher and others for the info. ill have to try the california burrito now.  Users/beekergene

20080512 10:48:58 nbsp Best seviche that Ive found in Yolo County Users/ACA

20080530 21:44:59 nbsp I ate their California burrito and it was great. The burrito was huge and it was filled with your choice of meat, potatoes, guac, sour cream, and pico. The potatoes were just at the right amount of mushiness and the chicken was flavor. The salsa bar wasnt too impressive, just chips and a red and green salsa but I liked drizzling the red salsa over my California burrito. For 7.25, it was a big and satisfying meal Users/justinhu

20080721 20:39:02 nbsp All I can say is WOW. The owners are awesome. The super burrito is so much better than Guads. The salsa bar is small but the green sauce has lime in it which makes it fresh. Like I said, the owners are really really nice.  Users/Rbbie2x

20081010 09:06:57 nbsp This place is AWESOME! Apart from their great service and delicious food, you make a lasting friendship with the owners, who are very caring and helpful. It should be noted that due to the size of the restaurant, they are unable to continue with their Happy Hour. I know we will all miss it, but its understandable that they would decide this. Taqueria Davis is more than worth checking out... Users/keeks

20081027 19:00:58 nbsp I just had an amazing pork burrito here, they are so much better than at Taqueria Guadalajara. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20081207 15:27:12 nbsp Friendly service, good food, but kinda pricey.  Davis Taqueria is a good restaurant, but gets more praise than it deserves. People who say that Davis Taqueria is the best/most authentic Mexican food in Davis have clearly not eaten at many Mexican restaurants around here. Davis Taqueria, Guadalajaras, and Chuys are all good, while Chuys is the best and most reasonably priced imo. Probably not worth driving all the way across town for a burrito, but neither is Davis Taqueria. Users/holag

20090112 21:17:23 nbsp More praise than it deserves? They deserve way more praise than we could ever come up with. Of course most of us have eaten at other restaurants in town, thats how weve formed our opinion abou this place, Duh!

Hands down, the best carnitas Ive ever had anywhere. I grew up eating Mexican food every day (I wonder why) and this is the real deal.  Users/DavidFeliz

20090209 03:04:39 nbsp This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Davis. The staff are all warm and welcoming, and they seem to have a lot of regulars, knowing them by name. Unlike many other restaurants, the meat in the burrito actually is tasty and your burrito doesnt drip all crazy. The salsa is limited, but definitely yummy! Users/TonyaNN

20090210 12:20:26 nbsp NOTE:
Taqueria Davis is open 11 AM  9 PM on Saturdays.  They have it posted as 114 but its the same hours during the week, you can call to confirm this.  They are also open 11 AM  4 PM on Sundays as far as I know. Users/campbellb

20090220 19:11:37 nbsp This is the first time I have ever left a Wiki comment, but I felt compelled after my experience tonight.  The NICEST people run this place, and the food is so very good.  You can buy meat by the pound and it comes with all the fixings (tortillas, onions, salsa, limes) and it is very affordable, great for entertaining!  It reminds me of the food I ate when I was a kid growing up in a small border town.  great place!!! Users/kissylizzer

20090407 19:41:28 nbsp I recently tried an egg burrito w/the ultra spicy sauce (which does contain habanero, wooo)  spectacularly delicious as always. Actually, I dont think Ive ever had a bad Taqueria Davis experience. I was very happy to learn that they are actually open on Saturdays till 9pm during the school year.  Users/YuanNiu

20090531 01:00:37 nbsp the lady here was superduper nice and accommodating of my vegan needs. when i asked about the status of rice and beans she also suggested that for those who dont do dairy and animal that she could fix something up nice for me anyway. this ended up being a veggie burrito minus rice (which is made with chicken i believe) and cheese, (though the beans are made WITHOUT lard and are vegetarian friendly) plus potatoes, onions and mushrooms (i have no idea why they have fresh mushrooms as i didnt see it as an ingredient in anything on the menu, cant complain). even though i have another preference for mexican food in davis, id come back here for the service <3.   Users/MiranPark

20090606 21:34:59 nbsp Echoing everyone else here: nice people, great food, etc. It was really busy tonight (Saturday) and food took a long time but they warned everyone before taking the orders. I had the egg burrito and friend had asada fries. Both were excellent and I thought tasty better than Guadalajara.  Users/Sar58

20090607 11:44:42 nbsp This place is sofa king good, Tarcisio is the bomb. Even with my terrible Spanish he always says when we going to mexico boss??. Their carnitas are awesome; these guys are from a little place outside of Jalisco so they really know it well.  Users/YesItsMe

20090609 14:54:30 nbsp I ate here for the first time today and I was not impressed. Guad is so much better for a couple of reasons.

1. Guads burritos are bigger
2. At Guad there are more flavors of salsa and the chips are way better (the chips at Davis Taqueria are not good at all really)
3. Guad is cheaper
4. Guad taste much much better.

I ordered a beef super burrito.  Users/RealComputers

20090719 13:34:07 nbsp My husband and I go here all the time for their excellent enchiladas (mole  ask for it! and suizas).  We like them so much, that we have never had anything else.   The fact that the owners are so friendly and welcoming is a great plus.  We really love this place! Users/lemurific

20090815 23:34:41 nbsp I cant say anything but great about this establishment. Great food, generous portions, friendly service, and for where it is located, great atmosphere. Get the carnitas super burrito, they are awesome! This is one of the Davis establishments that is in the top 10 in my opinion. Users/Darren22

20090824 17:25:40 nbsp Owners are really friendly and nice. I have no idea how they manage to remember everyone who enters the restaurant. You feel really welcomed everytime you stop by. Food is very authentic, very well served and delicious. There is no sauce that matches their green one and their burritos are really good. Prices are very fair and service is excelent. Users/Maga

20090826 13:56:08 nbsp Love the service and the food here. The people are soooo sweet, and that justifies paying $7.88 for the super burrito. Ive also had the soft chicken tacos...so delicious. My only issue was that my super burrito with chicken smelled very fishy...Im assuming that means the meats are all cooked in the same place, which isnt a huge issue for me but may be for other people. Definitely worth going to...and much better than chipotle (Ive never tried guad). Users/Kiran

20090923 13:14:50 nbsp My wife and I just ordered a chicken supreme burrito and a steak burrito (asada). We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the meat in both items. The chicken was all white meat. The steak was high quality. No fatty pieces of meat were in either burrito. Well certainly eat here again. In my opinion, no other Taqueria in Davis serves larger burritos. The staff are quite friendly and I wish them well. Users/Buckeye44

20091010 14:40:39 nbsp They are always super friendly. They have great food. Wish they were open Sundays! Users/DamarisTobar

20091016 14:18:01 nbsp Wow...possibly one of the most over priced veggie burritos Ive ever had.  It was basically a BRC + lettuce for $5.90!? AND their salsas were awful.  Really bad.  The red tasted like Pace and the tomatillo (though better) was too sweet and bland. Sure, they were friendly, but who wouldnt be if gringos were lining up to empty their pockets for you. Also...I counted 2 Mexicans in there and they were both behind the counter!  Granted there is a striking absence of Latinos in Davis, but still!   Users/AndyChuck
  Perhaps you went there during gringo time when they serve the gringo (vegetarian burrito) food.  They have great and reasonably priced (for Davis) meat burritos, and if youre there during lunch time, there are lots of Latinos eating there.  It actually appears to be the most frequented of the taquerias among the local workingclass Latinos, and there are lots in Davis (either living or working during the day), despite peoples blinders. Users/ScottLay

20091021 00:44:27 nbsp CARNE ASADA FRIES! SO DELICIOUS.
Also beef tongue soft tacos are my favorite too. Mmmm. Users/JenniferGiang

20091110 22:05:56 nbsp Best Mexican place in town. The carnitas are legendary. I have hardly strayed from the carnitas in the sixodd years I have been coming here tacos, burritos, tostadas, and dinner plates are all amazing. The beans and rice are fabulous and the red salsa always hits the spot. Everyone here is extremely nice as well, I wish they were open Sundays too. Dont pass it up! Users/EricWecker

20091117 16:53:06 nbsp Man, the other day Tarcisio slipped a tamale into my chile relleno burrito. Awesome! There is no better place in town.  Users/DavidFeliz

20100113 17:29:35 nbsp by far the best mexican food you can get in town and ive pretty much sampled all of the other taquerias.  the carne asada super burrito is the best ive ever had and it is huge, so one burrito could be for lunch and dinner.  the owners are very nice and friendly. if you live in davis, this is a must to eat at.  Users/OpticalOut

20100114 19:01:43 nbsp Best tacos in Davis! After living in Davis for a few years I finally went to TD for the first time. I had a carnitas taco at the behest of a friend, and was not disappointed. A little greasy, but thats what a crispy taco with fried pork should be. Later, ended up getting a chile relleno burrito and was more than impressed. Only downside (for vegetarian/vegan eaters) is that the rice appears to be cooked using chicken stock (just like Guad). The staff is unbelievably nice and Im definitely going back. A+ Users/Bob413

20100117 13:41:31 nbsp Where to begin? I have been meaning to leave commentary on this page for a while. Taqueria Davis is FANTASTIC! The owners are quite possibly the nicest people on the planet, and the food is DELICIOUS! Their tacos are amazing, and just thinking about them makes my mouth water. The carnitas or lengua tacos are the way to go. I have been to all of the other Mexican restaurants in town and this one is the most authentic. Their food tastes just like the food in Mexico. I will NEVER go to any other Mexican food joint in Davis. The food here is consistently delicious! Thanks Sara and Tarcisio for the delicious food!! Users/AndreaG

20100117 18:13:45 nbsp Does anyone know whats going on with Taqueria Davis?  I went by today and it looked as if it was under renovation or closed!  I hope its not the latter.  This is the best Mexican food restaurant in Davis!!! Users/spindle

20100119 16:32:27 nbsp I havent been by in a few weeks, but Sara and Tarcisio often take family vacations.  If it was closed, it was probably for the holiday weekend or something.  More power to them!

Ive been going here for many years.  The food is fantastic, and I absolutely love the owners.  They always ask after my wife by name if shes not with me.  They always want to catch up when we drop by, and of course they know our favorites.  I recommend the carnitas super burrito.

The prices arent the lowest in town, and the burritos arent quite as big as Guad, but theyre more than big enough for a meal, and in my opinion the quality easily makes up for the price.  I hope everythings well with the business!  Ill have to drop by this week and see :) Users/TomGarberson

20100128 12:35:11 nbsp Having lived directly down the block from them for a few years I now regret not having dined here before.

It is a small, humble location, located between Aggie Liquor and Pizza Guys on the corner of 5th and L Street. Once inside you will see small tables set up more for small familiar gatherings than for the large dinner parties. The walls are plastered with gems from history on one side including photos of famous actors and actresses of Latin film along with photos of old Missions and even a wanted poster for Fransisco (Pancho) Villa while on the other are true pieces of fine Mexican Art work. Its auburn interior brings about a comfort that is surprising when blended with the natural lighting from the front windows.

The staff, a young woman and man, a very friendly and fluent in both Spanish and English to make it easy for everyone to convey their order requests. I went with my girlfriend and she immediately hit it off with them which only made things nicer.

As for the portions:

1) Price was reasonable and bordered on the lowend.
2) Servings are large for the cost.
3) The quality of the food was superb with a truly authentic taste, unlike El Mariachi or others I have eaten in Davis. Seemed much more like sitting down to a Mexican family meal than being in a restaurant.

The girlfriend had three tacos and an Horchata (freshly made rice/cinnamon drink)while I had Steak Fries. The Tacos were well presented, not flashy but tasty, and were made exactly as requested. The Steak fries, something I have never had before this, were a rather interesting blend of American style French Fries with Mexican Style Steak, Guacamole (which I normally hate but loved theirs) Spanish Fried Rice, Sour cream, Tomatoes and Cilantro along with other ingredients I am not sure of... It was amazing. Overall I would rate the place 4/5 stars just because of the location. Move to a better location and this establishment easily garners 5/5. Users/WesOne

20100221 00:30:01 nbsp A couple years later and this is by far my favorite burrito place in Davis.  Guad doesnt even come close for me.  Their tacos (both crispy and soft) and carne asada fries are awesome as well.  This place is one of the things Im going to miss most about Davis. Users/BrandonWong

20100225 14:14:51 nbsp This is the best place in town to get Tacos. Their California Burrito is good too and so are the Carne Asada Fries. They recently launched a new website. You can view their menu on there and find out more about them using the website at the top of this page. http://www.taqueriadavis.infoUsers/jlc1988

20100316 16:45:10 nbsp Being from Southern California, I miss good, authentic Mexican food more than anything else. So glad I finally decided to try this place  its amazing!! Now when my boyfriend and I decide to go there for dinner, I look forward to it all day...cant say enough good things about the employees/owners, food, and atmosphere. The pictures on the walls are awesome and I want to steal them :) Users/mooodavis

20100329 10:54:09 nbsp If you really want to compare TD with El Mariachi, heres how: TD: only two salsas, excellent food. EM: A million salsas, extremely low quality food. The measure of a Mexi restaurant is not in their salsa bar, despite what Guad and EM seem to think recently. Its in their carnitas! lol Users/YesItsMe

20100331 23:58:10 nbsp om nom nom nom. so delicious! i frickin love this place. :) im a selfconfessed burrito addict, and ive been to every single burrito joint in davis, save for dos coyotes & chuys (i keep meaning to check these two out, but...). seriously. i get mad cravings for their super burritos at night... mmm.

as for the food, i recommend the pastor. idk why (maybe just that day was off?) but when i got the carnitas, it was super dry for me for some reason. :( which made me sad. but it was ok because the pastor  delicious! :3; and yes, the food tends to be greasy, but thats probably why its so delicious! and yeah, not the cheapest burritos in town, but you get what you pay for. ^^

i sound like a babbling idiot, so im just going to stop now. ~_~; but like i said, this place seriously has the best burritos in davis. plus the owners are really nice... i think theyve seen me come in enough that they recognize me now. :) Users/sugarpop

20100407 00:07:18 nbsp taqueria davis is the best mexican restaurant in town. Guad super burrito is full of tasteless rice and the flavor its average. even though guad has more salsas, the chips taste awful, like a cardboard craker.
i dont know about you guys, but were else can you get fries, meat, guacamole, cheese, sour cream and salsa all mixed together in a beatiful bowl.
 Users/Alekhine

20100419 20:08:39 nbsp After reading all the reviews on Davis Wiki, I decided to give this place a try. Prior to trying them out, Ive been content with Guads. The California burrito was really good. The price, well lets just say $7.50 was a little steep for the size of the burrito especially since Guads burritos are only $5 and pack a bigger punch like Mike Tyson. Their salsa was definitely more flavorful than Guads. Would I go back? Yeah probably if I had a spare $2.50 to spend.  Users/103

20100605 17:32:26 nbsp Taq Davis is fantastic! A guy at the Coop sent us tourons over and Ive been back a bunch whenever Im in town. The mole, usually with enchiladas, is killer. I always try a new mexi restaurants mole as a true measure of its authenticity and Taq Davis passed in the top 3 of best mole Ive had period. Dont miss it.  Users/barBranch

20100607 01:39:01 nbsp Probably my favorite burritos. Lets be realistic, burritos arent something you should eat every day (as much as i wish i could), so i dont mind spending a couple dollars more for something i prefer. I was a guads believer for the first two years here at davis, but since trying TD out (initially just for the carne asada fries, PS delicious) Ive been coming here almost exclusively. crunchy tacos are great (favorite meats are the lengua, cabeza, and asada. carnitas was dry the one time i had it, the one fault ive had), nachos are good, CA fries and cali burrito are awesome. Also the green enchiladas special was great.

their horchata is probably the best in davis, doesnt have that powdered mix taste (because, from what i can tell, it isnt powdered mix)

Salsa bar is small. But im here for food, not sauce (imo its just a garnish anyways, not really the measure of a restauraunt). chips are passable, but I havent found any place with chips that I really like here in davis. they work well for nachos and adding crunch while eating a burrito.

Last but not least, the people working here are all really nice. the cooks bring out your food with a smile, the lady who works the cash register is always really nice and smiling and easygoing. Highly recommended establishment  Users/EugeneB
  Follow up to my review: I feel like i need to find an anonymous support group for that red salsa. Its so amazingly delicious. Between that salsa, their amazing chile verde, and the california burrito/carne asada fries, I could happily eat myself into a coma here. Users/EugeneB

20100608 20:21:11 nbsp My best friend´s brother is the owner of this place, but I live in Mexico City :´( and I wish I could visit TD someday and eat one of those famous burritos!! Users/DiegoAbreu

20100615 20:31:49 nbsp The best Mexican food in Davis, hands down!  I love that the couple that owns/operates this place is so friendly and welcoming. Its a winwin, I love giving them the business, and they give me excellent quesadillas! Users/npguistino

20100624 11:11:07 nbsp Great little place, very nice owners, really good food.  I always just get whatever the special is and it is always good.  My favorite are the Mexico City Tacos.  Salsa bar is small, but their one main salsa is the best in town. Users/advogt

20100713 23:03:53 nbsp The food is great and the customer service is fantastic.  Tarcisio and Sara treat all of their customers like family.   Users/SuperDave

20100820 01:52:02 nbsp Friendliest service of any business in Davis. Amazing homemade hard tacos and the most unique burrito in town; the California burrito. Do not skip over this taqueria. A must for any local or visitor alike.

20101005 21:58:52 nbsp Had this for the first time the other day with my friend, she was raving about the carne asada fries, which by the way are amazing! Delicious burritos that are huge and super nice owners/employees! Users/NorCalFoodLover

20110303 15:15:41 nbsp This is my favorite place to eat in Davis!  I always bring my friends and family here when they visit and they love it too.  I eat here about once a week and I have a usual.  When you walk in you are warmly greeted and the owners are very friendly.  They always know exactly what I want when I come in and always greet me with Hola, mija!  The crispy tacos al pastor taste so good and the cheese is very tasty.  The chips and salsa are way better than the kind you get at larger restaurants and corporate restaurants.  Best food in Davis. Users/LoriOrf

20110306 22:13:24 nbsp On Friday I had the mole enchiladas which were the special, and they were excellent. The horchata and salsa were also very good as usual. <3 Users/NickSchmalenberger
 Those mole enchiladas are the only thing that can pull me away from my usual these days (carnitas super burrito). Users/TomGarberson

20110405 12:22:07 nbsp I was craving my Santa Cruz favorite, Taqueria Vallarta, and decided to give this place a try. It was amazing! I had their pastor (pork) burrito and it was fantastic! I got it 49 style with the enchilada sauce on the side. I have never had better enchilada sauce it is the perfect combination of rich tomato and smokey peppers. The chips so crisp and light and the green salsa is wonderful. I will be back!  Users/DanielleC

20110406 19:21:10 nbsp Probably the best burritos in Davis. They are the only place Ive found that have vegetarian burritos that arent completely bland. Even though they only have 2 kinds of salsa, both are loads better than what youd find anywhere else. And the owners are super nice!! Users/pacstuck

20110406 21:01:06 nbsp Looooooove the chicken nachos and carne asada fries here. Cant be beat. This is my favourite Mexican restaurant in Davis. :) Users/Morganna

20110505 01:39:54 nbsp By FAR the best Mexican food in Davis. Originally from SoCal, Im a selfproclaimed Mexican food snob and this place has impressed me. The owners are so friendly and the food is delicious and reasonably priced. I live across the street from another taqueria and I still choose to drive across town to get TaqDavis food. If you like El Mariachi, Chipotle, Dos Coyotes, or Guads, give this place a try, you wont regret it. Users/alissaw995

Its just OK...kinda overpriced. Users/JoshLawson

20110518 01:39:43 nbsp Best Mexican food in davis. Love their Carnitas.  Users/CarlosOverstreet

20110612 22:48:18 nbsp This place is awesome!! Best Chile Rellano and Tostadas de Ceviche, in Davis!!! They also dont load the dishes with extreme tomato sauce like Guads, which is a plus. Really great service and atmosphere.  Users/TraNgu

20110627 17:41:30 nbsp Its fun (and very tasty) to get a burrito with egg and potato in it, plus meat, rice, beans, cheese, and salsa. Users/CovertProfessor

20110728 00:01:04 nbsp This place is the bomb. Sara and Tarcisio are the coolest people, incredibly friendly. Their carnitas are incredible. The best Mexican Ive ever been too, and extremely good prices. Maybe the Guads burritos are bigger, maybe not, but all I know is that a Super is very filling. Users/FredericChristie

20111117 14:29:29 nbsp This is the best Mexican food in Davis! The prices are good and the portions are huge. Not to mention, the owners are the sweetest people ever. My friend forgot her wallet once and they let her order and pay the next time she came in. I always get the california burrito, but ive tried their enchiladas and super burrito as well. plus, homemade salsas and horchata! Users/nsjung

20111218 19:04:27 nbsp I tried the super burrito with asada, horchata, and carne asada fries on two separate days last week because of the reviews on DavisWiki. The burrito was good, it tasted like genuine Mexican food and it had a lot of flavor. The horchata is amazing! I wasnt that impressed with the carne asada fries because of the fries. It reminds me of frozen packaged fries. The lady behind the counter is very nice and friendly. The second time I ordered, I called it in because I didnt want to wait inside. I was told it would be ready in 15 minutes. I arrived on time, but my order wasnt ready and I had to wait a little bit more. They had a line, so no biggie. Both salsas they offer are good. Next up, tacos! Users/VKC

20120404 19:41:23 nbsp Taqueria Davis has officially become my favorite Mexican restaurant! I love the Pastor Super Burrito without beans, if I could eat this for every meal every day for the rest of my life, I would. Its that good!  Users/VKC

20120425 09:58:40 nbsp Came here with my roommate for the first time because she swore it was the best Mexican place in town. I ordered the California Burrito because I hadnt been able to taste one since I traveled to San Diego last year. While not quite as good as what I remembered from my trip, this was still an amazing burrito. It was huge and stuffed with meat, potatoes, and guacamole. Definitely the most authentic burrito Ive had in Davis. Their tortilla chips are really tasty too. The salsa bar selection is limited to a mild green and a spicy red. The green salsa was bland, but the spicy red salsa was addictive and had me returning for more. This is now my goto place in Davis when Im hungry for delicious, authentic Mexican food. Users/AlexHirsch

20130611 21:50:21 nbsp People, do not judge this restaurant by its location or store front. If you do, you will miss not only a supertasty experience but two of the nicest people in the Davis restaurant business. We recently moved to Central Davis and wanted to try out Taqueria Davis based on its close proximity to us as well as the excellent Wiki and Yelp reviews. My family and I came here on a stinkin, hot Friday night looking to keep from cooking in our kitchen and to have a cold beer. Being vegetarian, we are wary of trying new Mexican places as many use chicken stock in their rice or pork in their beans. Not only does Taqueria Davis have a vegan burrito but Sara went out of her way to point out all the other menu items that are vegetarian, including the rice and beans. In addition, after only meeting us once, we were welcomed into her Hon family. It was an absolute pleasure to eat at Taqueria Davis and we enjoyed making new neighborhood friends. I encourage you try them out yourself as I highly recommend their hospitality and their food! Users/DebWestergaard

20130824 08:39:38 nbsp Friendly service, AMAZING food, awkward hours for fulltime students with internships and jobs (though it looks like its open later now? I thought it was only open til 8pm). The carne asada fries here are so good, but I go to El Burrito more  often by sheer virtue of the fact that its open later. Anyway, definitely  make it out here when you can and when it is open, it will be more than worth it. I recommend california burrito or the carne asada fries. The carne asada here is very moist and flavorful.  Users/HannahToru

20131205 16:38:06 nbsp My favorite place to get a burrito or carne asada fries in Davis.  The employees are always super friendly and the food is great.  I recommend trying the taekwondo meat which can be substituted for the meat in any item for something like $1.25.  Its sort of sweet korean bbq style beef. Users/RyanMeyerhoff

20140501 14:58:37 nbsp I was really excited for their vegan burrito, but then I saw them dump the veggies on the grill where the meat just was (could see meat bits still there) and had to take my burrito home and give it to a friend. Even though they call the burrito vegan, they defeat their purpose by cooking it on the same surface as the meat. :(  I havent been back since, but if they changed their procedures Id be a regular.
