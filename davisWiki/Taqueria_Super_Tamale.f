Many Davis residents have never heard of this Mexican restaurant.  They dont advertise other than the sign on their store front.  They arent even in the phone book.  Many people whove been here think this is the most authentically Mexican restaurant in Davis.

Theyre pretty vegetarianfriendly, as they dont use lard or meat broth in their refried beans or rice.

The owner is a very friendly guy.  He calls many of his customers amigo.  Hola mi amigo! How are you doing?  The other people who work there seem to be his family; they arent as friendly.

They have varied menu options including breakfast selections (served from 8am to 11:30am all six days), traditional a la carte items in addition to 25 combination platters, daily specials, childrens plates, group meal options, some salads, and both Mexican and American beverages.  On Saturdays they specialize in Menudo and Posole, although this reviewer has yet to sample either dish.

They offer a small salsa bar; although the choice selection cant compare to larger restaurants such as El Mariachi, the salsas are homemade and delicious.


  When my friends and I were regulars here, the owner would usually give us free drinks. Users/RishiTrivedi

20050308 22:08:07 nbsp I dont understand how this place stays in business.  Everytime I walk by they are either closed or completely devoid of customers.  It may be a money laundering operation for the Mexican Mafia. Users/KilgoreTrout

20050309 22:23:10 nbsp Everytime Ive eaten a burrito here I got sick.  Dont waste your time.  Go to Guad or Taqueria Davis instead. Users/JeremySmith

20050309 23:17:19 nbsp Well, I dont think a place has to do much business to make a profit.  As long as you have a little lunch and dinner rush, all you need to do is break even during the other hours.  But you stay open during those hours just in case you get a small crowd where you do make some decent money.  Ive eaten here, and I dont think its as shady as people suggest.  However, theres no reason to go out of your way if El Mariachi, Taqueria Davis or Guad are closer (my order of preference). Users/JaimeRaba

20050421 14:12:59 nbsp Never open, unfortunately, but if you chance upon their open door, dont miss out. Users/DanielMedinaCleghorn

20050731 00:15:08 nbsp Im from Texas and its refreshing not to have Baja Fresh all the time.  This place rules... always friendly service... just try out your limited Spanish vocab... never been sick after eating here... always cool Spanish soap operas playinng... get the enchiladas, the sauce is friggin for real... and they have Negro Modelos...

20050825 21:01:52 nbsp I had to try this place, as part of my mission to try evey burrito in Davis. I went on a Thursday at 8PM and the place was empty; not a good sign. The very friendly owner/cashier/cook took my order, my money, and then walked right back to the dining area where he was watching Spanish television. I thought this was strange, but thought perhaps I was missing something. Nope. After five minutes he got up, walked back to the kitchen and made my tamale and burrito. Based on Carl McCabes recommendation, I figured I had to try the namesake tamale.  I hate to say it, but the tamale was flavorless, and the burrito had a heavy, chewy quality. The burrito had almost no vegetables in it. I had to force it down. The salsa bar had two containers of something which looked anything but fresh; I avoided them.  Overall, I give this place (and the burrito) a rating of: 3. Sorry, but the only redeeming quality of this dive is its friendly owner. P.S. I used to live in Austin, and I really miss Baha Fresh.
