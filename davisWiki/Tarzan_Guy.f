Dr. Dave Pyles (aka Rex David Pyles, aka Dave Pyles, Dr. Dave, DaveO) is Tarzan Guy, one of the town characters more distinctive individuals who wears a full fledged Tarzanlike outfit.  He can often be seen biking or walking running around the downtown and campus areas on weekends.  Rumors that he is a post doc in plant biology are false; Users/SharonZimmerman Sharon pointed out that hes an atmospheric science postdoc.

He used to live at one of the on campus coops, but now he spends much of his time at Elusis, a commune up in the Coast Range.

He is a postdoc in the Biomicrometeorology group, where he developed the Advanced CanopyAtmosphereSoil Algorithm (http://scholar.google.com/scholar?qACASA+model&hlen&lr&btnGSearch ACASA) to model the atmosphere near the Earths surface.

The fur, as Dave usually calls it, was originally an costume of Cutter from the comic wiki:wikipedia:Elfquest. He made a suit for Burning Man (2004?). Afterwards, he liked it so much he made a couple more and started wearing them as regular fashion. Users/rickyspeak tried to talk him out of it.

Contrary to the costume, hes actually fairly shy.



20070602 17:44:10 nbsp I see him in the east Davis area around Lehigh a lot. He wears what looks like furry underwear with furry boots and rides a bike.  Users/HeatherFlood

20070602 17:59:23 nbsp This guy is really smart, nice and open.  He hangs out around the Domes.  Hes a graduate student / postdoc, for sure, but I forget which major.  He explained to me and Dan Masiel why the http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/solarsystem/voyager_agu.html heliosheath around the solar system caused the voyager to unexpectedly change velocity.  Im sure hell see this and comment :) Users/PhilipNeustrom

20070602 19:45:11 nbsp I have seen this fellow at the Coop near Rienda Hall Rienda and at Whole Earth Festival WEF this year. Users/JoseBleckman,

20070809 04:29:08 nbsp his name is Dave Pyles, but some people call him Caveman Dave. Hes an atmospheric science postdoc. Users/SharonZimmerman

20070918 21:03:50 nbsp weird seeing myself up on this page...one can consider all this fur a 4D art project.
corregna: Eleusis is not a commune, but a realm (communes dont exist). Presently the only large
animal inhabitants at Eleusis are bears, mountain lions, lynx, and coyote).
also: there is underwear folks, and its not on the outside.
heliosheath?  did I really say that? not heliopause?

RDPyles

ps: usually people who yell caveman! are too far away to know the difference, or if they are close
and still do it they are also likely to be found near the Delta of Venus...otherwise...ugetit.

pps: i have no relation to Geico, inc., though it is possible that both of us have
enhanced each others crossrecognition, particularly when traveling through airports.

ppps: if i did this for the money, i would be a billionaire. this statement begs its own negation. Users/rdpyles

20080101 03:07:12 nbsp Do you wear that to work, or just on the weekends? :) Just wondering. Users/HeatherBeck

20080108 16:03:23 nbsp In answer to your question Heather, yes, he does wear that to work occasionally. I work with him. Last quarter he introduced himself to a class I was TAing while wearing the fur. It was the highlight of my quarter. He once traveled by air from Bolder to Sacramento in the fur. He even changed airplanes somewhere.
I know him well enough to be able to say that the fur is only an external manifestation of a man who is truly trying to live a life unaffected by the more mundane pressures that society places on us. We should salute him as he cruises around town on his business, or at least give him a thumbs up or an appreciative smile. Users/JohnKochendorfer

20080226 09:36:08 nbsp Maybe I just have the weirdest crush on Dave <3 Users/JJBaker

20080828 10:02:42 nbsp Speaking with him on occasion, he is damn brilliant. Users/DavidPoole

20090921 22:02:42 nbsp Rex is one of my dearest friends.  Not only is Daveman a hyperintelligent Biomicrometeorologist, but he is also a talented dancer and painter.  His understanding of the complexities within our surroundings transcends into his art or perhaps it is his art that fuels his understanding of nature... either way, he loves cats; furry, fuzzy, floppy, cozy, cuddly, kitties.  RDP, if anyone, could survive an apocalypse.  As of recent, you might find Mr. Dave foraging in order to find local consumable vegetation so that people will be able to survive an apocalypse. Users/NCHogan

20101103 17:14:21 nbsp Dave has been my friend for 12 years now.  Ive lived with him in some manner for 8 years of that.  That being said I thought I should add something to this page.  My prior edits seem to have disappeared, but at least the picture I posted is still here.  Yay.

Rex David Pyles, aka Dave Pyles, Dr. Dave, DaveO, etc. really is a Doctor in Atmospheric Science from here at UC Davis.  Hes currently a post doc in the Atmospheric Science Department, though in a partially unofficial way.

The fur, as Dave usually calls it, was originally an costume of Cutter from the comic Elfquest (Google it).  He made a suit for Burning Man (2004, I think).  Afterwards, he liked it so much he made a couple more and started wearing them as regular fashion.   I tried to talk him out of it.

Contrary to the costume, hes actually fairly shy and will start to ramble incoherently because of this.  Once he gets to know you hell settle down.

I hope this clears things up to people have been wanting more info. Users/rickyspeak

20110207 02:20:56 nbsp I met Dave face to face for the first time today. He was wearing a regular sweatshirt paired with a womens skirt, and he was talking about Plutonium while drinking a handle of Jaagermeister. Good times. Users/EliseKane

20110913 10:09:50 nbsp Dave is one of the sweetest, most caring, most intelligent people you will ever meet, and I feel so so so lucky to call him one of my best friends. He is so brilliant and so funny and THE CUTEST DANCER. Speak to him with your heart and he will protect you through his power of love wave armpit farts.  Users/SharmiBasu
