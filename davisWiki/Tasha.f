Tasha has absolutely no interest in following commands, unless there are large quantities of food involved, and even then she tends to take her time. Were trying.

Tasha was, formerly, a recognizable dog. Apparently her parents are an extremely busy pair, however, and theres now about a million dogs around Davis that look like Tasha. Youve probably seen at least ten of them in the shelter showcases. You also may have seen her littermate, Daisy, who has been in the Davis Enterprise on the grounds that shes a service dog. Im not 100% sure about the names of the other puppies, but the girls all had flower names that start with D. Would love to meet the others. (:


Feb. 3rd Tasha almost got mauled by a Chihuahua in front of Petco today. I think shes scarred for life.
