20071031 19:41:31 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. Would it be ok if the Off Campus Meal Plan page retains historical information about that program, but has a prominent pointer to the current Aggie Cash page? That way the wiki can offer both a historical perspective and current and useful information. Users/JasonAller

20071101 09:31:10 nbsp The Off Campus Meal Plan no longer exists. I wouldnt be opposed to having two separate pages for each, but having the nonexistent OCMP may confuse students. Just a thought. Users/Tatianna
