ive never heard anything about their parties or philanthropy, but i do see their posters featuring Ronnie Reagan everywhere. also, was the above photo taken at the bottom of the ocean? can we do any better than that?  Users/ArlenAbraham

Their iceblocking parties were a frequent event when I was a freshman and had to walk to parties. Imagine 100 strangers putting their mouths on the same indentation on a block of ice and the TKEs pouring Kamikazes down the channel. Console your fears of salivaborne diseases with the ideas that alcohol kills everything and that hopefully the ice has melted sufficiently since the last person put their mouth there that youve got fresh ice. Also dont expect to feel your mouth again for a while.    Users/DanielMedinaCleghorn
