Cold food is not taxed. Only hot food is taxed. Hot food is food that is heated such as food served in restaurants, fast food restaurants, a deli of a supermarket, or take out cart. For example, if you buy a hot sandwich at a deli it will be taxed. However, if you bought a cold sandwich at a deli, it should not be taxed. If the deli puts the cold sandwich into a microwave for a few seconds, it would then be taxed. The same goes for sandwiches at a place like a subway sandwich shop. If they toast any ingredient of the sandwich or the bread, it will be taxed.

Pet food that is manufactured to be eaten only by pets is taxed. The reason is that pet food is not to be consumed by humans. Fish bait is also taxed.

Prescriptions are not taxed. However, medications that do not require a prescription are taxed. These are called overthecounter or OTC medications. Vitamins are taxed as they are not considered food.

Items that are downloaded on the internet are not taxed in California. For example, online purchases of downloadable music and downloadable software are not taxed.
