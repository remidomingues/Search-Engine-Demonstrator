Physically, Tay has brown skin (one might assume she is black) (one will PROBABLY assume she is black), brown hair, dark eyes, is 54, wont divulge her weight to the public, and will soon have three piercings in each ear. Mentally, she is generally intelligent, yet mathretarded. Great at memorization, terrible at project planning.
She LOVES anime and video games (but loves anime more), and LOVES people who love those two things as well. She also has the capacity to simply reciprocate whatever love one pours out to her, regardless of his/her views on anime or video games. But if you like DDR, shell REALLY love YOU. Duh, she doesnt like sportsshes too busy with the anime and such. Tay also becomes anxious when sitting in one spot for too long, so this description has arrived at its end  ).
