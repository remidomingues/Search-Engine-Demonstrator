This is Taylor Clark! He plays guitar, and he drives a sweet car. Nice rhyme huh? He plays airsoft with many others. He is part of Team Breakfast, one of the founders in fact. He is known as Pancakes on the battle field, yet he has recently taken on the name of Toaster, which also fits the team breakfast code.

Taylor is also a ninja. You may have seen him around downtown climbing things or killing robots. Or yelling at pirates.

eggnog is one of his favorite drinks this time of year.
