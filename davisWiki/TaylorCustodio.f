Hello!

My name is Taylor and I am transferring to UCD this Fall. I am currently a liveinnanny and looking for families in Davis who are in need of child care. I have 10+ years of babysitting experience and have been a liveinnanny since April 2013. I have experience with ages 2 months to 15 years young. I am equipped with a long list of references!

Thank you,
Taylor Custodio
