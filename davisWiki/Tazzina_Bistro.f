Tazzina Bistro is a restaurant located in nearby Woodland.  It is a relatively new restaurant in the Historic Cranstons Building.  Mostly California cuisine style with a bit of a French influence.

Yolo County native, Rebecca Reichardt has enlivened downtown Woodlands dull dining scene with Tazzina Bistro. Rebecca began her culinary career at Redrum Burger Murder Burger while studying accounting. She took a few cooking classes and discovered her lifes passion. She focused her skills, and in September, 2004, her dream came true with the opening of Tazzina Bistro.

The restaurant is a bit eclectic, with twinkly lights hung in front, lots of art on the walls, a giant espresso cup inscribed with the restaurants name above the open kitchen. Servers are genuinely enthusiastic about the restaurant and food, so service is warm and friendly.  The food is pricey on a college budget ($1520 per meal), being that most, if not all produce is organic and locally grown. Overall is it worth a trip since its better than the food in Davis.

Tazzina means little cup in Italian

Beer and Wine and Alcohol


Tazzina Bistro features about ten wines by the glass that is rotated on a frequent basis.  They have over thirty beer selections, although you will not find very many domestic selections.  Bud and Bud light are your best options.  They do feature most of the Stone beers; a brewery down in San Diego which is probably most famous for their Arrogant Bastard Ale.  If you want something big, try the Avery Mephistopheles Stout.  As far as their Alcohol selection, you will not find one better for the size of restaurant that they are.  Most of the mixes are housemade, such as the sweet and sour and the margarita mix

This is generally an older person (read: age 50+) spot as opposed to a student hangout.  This may have to do with the price of the entres and the type of food.  I went on datenight with the boyfriend and found the restaurant to be absolutely charming.  Not too many tables, exposed brick walls, soft music.  The food was excellently prepared.  We got the chestnut risotto.  This is a heavy creamy dish but full of subtle flavor.  Also had a dish called something like Veggies 5 Ways.  This involved a quiche, some salad, endives, some sauteed veggies.  Everything was great.  This is a nice special occasion spot.  Would be a good place to go with a new date if you didnt want to run into random Davis people but you did want great food and the chance to talk.

20060523 22:39:46 nbsp Ummm Im quite a bit younger than 50+ and I dont feel out of place there.  I think you are giving the wrong impression.  Not a student hangout, I agree.  Maybe 30+ would be better.  In any case, excellent food.  Some of the best in the Sacramento area.  Service can be unprofessional (mostly overly enthusiastic).  Definitely worth checking out.

20060809 17:59:22 nbsp I had a wonderful experience here! The prices are very reasonable for the quality of food, the atmosphere is tasteful & relaxing, and the waitservice very pleasant. Went with a few friends so we all got to trade tastes  everything was great and in perfectly sized portions. I believe the menu changes seasonally, so check Tazzinas website for the current menu.

20060810 07:54:39 nbsp A friend of mine says the Kobe burger (lunch menu) is fantastic (though not cheap). Users/AlexPomeranz

20070523 13:29:20 nbsp I just went here for lunch for the first time.  The place is very nice looking  almost out of place in downtown Woodland.  They have a full bar, and the waiters and waitresses were all dressed nicely.  Seemed like a good place to go on a date, though the service wasnt all that good.  Portions were on the small side compared to typical restaurant fare, but they were sufficient, and generally in the $810 or so range for lunch.

I had a seared rare ahi tuni sandwich that had avacado, pickled onions, and a curry aioli sauce on focaccia bread.  It was seriously the best sandwich I think I have ever eaten.  The flavor was phenomenal. Users/AlexPomeranz

20070523 13:32:12 nbsp I just ate here and had a seared ahi salad and almost died it was so good. Well worth the money. Users/JoshFernandez

20090113 08:54:46 nbsp I would have commented on this page long ago if I knew it exitsted! As a recent Woodland transplant from Davis, Tazzina Bistro is my absolute favorite place to eat in Woodland. Though it may seem out of place, as others have said, I think it is exacltly what downtown Woodland needs more of. My husband and I (who are NOT old, 25 to be exact) go there about twice a month for a nice dinner, and always take friends and family out there for special occasions. Their food and staff is fantastic! I love the seasonal changes in their menu. My top picks are the kobe burger, meatloaf, crab croquettes, risotto, and of course, in the Summer their fried green tomatoes are the best! They just added a swanky new bar and lounge, and I definitely think this place should not be reserved for the older crowd.  Users/AmLin

20090228 01:14:33 nbsp I went here for dinner today and it was fantastic! My bf and I were looking for a great place to celebrate our 3 yr anniversary and I decided to try Tazzina bc of all the great reviews. It did not disappoint. For starters we had the fromage a trois and the special smoked salmon on crostini. The salmon was great but the cheese selection was just okay. I wished it came with more than just olives and the baguettes. Some candied nuts and fresh fruit would have been nice. For the entrees he had the grilled ahi tuna and I had the pork sugo. The pork was tasty but the ahi tuna was even better. It came with a mushroom ragout that was extremely flavorful. we ended up switching dishes halfway through bc i really wanted those mushrooms. I was also surprised at how much I liked the side of polenta bc I just recently declared how much I detested it. For dessert we got the trio of sorbetpomegranate, mango and pineapple. It was refreshing and perfect. Our waitress Katy was funny and entertaining, she even gave us samples of these squished pecan bars. Yes, the place was rather full of folks in their 50s with a few in their 20s. However thats fine with me, I didnt feel out of place and good food is good food. Well definitely be returning.

20100801 12:02:15 nbsp Jest went there last night for our Wedding Anniversary dinner.  Was really quite excellent.  Nice setting.  Music in the background but not too loud.  Shared nice appetizer  goat cheese and squash bottom fritters.  Warm with a smoky/dipping sauce.  Had the fried green tomato salad which was excellent.  My wife had the gazpacho which was also very good.  For dinner I had the Herbed Ricotta Gnocchi  it was almost perfect.  Nice balance of sauce, veggies, gnocci, flavors.  My wife had the sea bass special which she said was good but I did not try.  Then we had the Tazzina sampler dessert  three expresso cups filled with something.  All quite good.  Service was excellent too.  Definitely best dining experience I have had in Woodland and food was better than any of the places I have been in Davis.  Definitely will be going back for special dinners.  Not cheap mind you, but worth the price w/o a doubt.  Users/JonathanEisen
