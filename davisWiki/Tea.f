Has anyone perfected brewing tea with Davis Tap Water municipal water at home?  In my experience, the color and tannins come through very well, but the tea flavor doesnt come out at all.  I get weakly tea flavored strongly tannic dark liquid.  Over the next month or so, Im going to try brewing with a variety of bottled water.  If I can figure out how to post them here, I shall do so.  There has to be something I can do to get good tea besides import municipal water from the East Bay.   Users/JudithTruman

 Hit a chem lab and steal some of their deionized water?  Just tossing it out as an idea.  ct

 I would suggest getting a Brita filter (the pitcher type).  When I lived in Davis, I brewed tea with filtered tap water, and it came out all right.  And Im a tea snob. Users/MikeIvanov

  MikeIm not happy with the Brita filtered water for tea.  Im trying for decent Irish Breakfast.  Brita water is just fine for drinking plain, though. Users/JudithTruman

  Interesting, let me know what works the best for you.  Good tea choice, by the way! Users/MikeIvanov

 Tea Snob Warning...I dont trust Davis water at all and didnt even try. I take the water out from the supermarket purification machines. Its reasonably tasteless but maintains a minimal character of water in the form of trace particles. Brita just doesnt cut it. The notion of using DI water kinda scares me though. Rumors of DI water leaching your soul out gives me the shivers. In the end, if Im gonna pay $200/lb for tea, I better have water that at least wont come with other stuff. I do admit to bringing a 5gallon bottle up to Tahoe and using that water down here; most wonderful H2O experience in my life, if such an experience could be had. Users/EricWu

 For my water, I import extra virgin ice melt water from high in the Himalayas. This can only be captured the first week of spring, by yak back. After shipping in pure quartz bottles back to the States, it is tripledistilled, deionized, and then checked via NMR for the right proportion of double, triple, and quadruple water molecule clusters. Only then, is it ready for the perfect cup of tea. My tea? I buy whatevers on sale. Users/SteveDavison

Does anybody know of a place in town that sells Thai tea (leaf)?  The CoOp doesnt have it. Users/KenjiYamada
   Try the supermarkets.  I know one of them (Safeway or Nugget) have sold it in the past, and likely still do, somewhere on the wall of teas.  It took a bit of finding when I went looking for it.  Users/JabberWokky jw
  If youre looking for the type of Thai leaf tea used for Thai Iced Tea, try Kims Mart or one of the Ethnic Markets Asian markets in Sacramento. Otherwise, I believe Cost Plus World Market as well as Peets Coffee have pretty good selections. Users/AlphaDog

20070522 11:04:39 nbsp As far as I know, the best pricetoquality ratio to be got in Davis is the Brooke Bond Red Label at International Food Market. Its only $4.75 for a 450 g box, and nigh indistinguishable to this nonconnoisseur from the Barrys bags you can get at Cost Plus World Market (in spite of the fact that IIRC Barrys Gold is a blend of Assam and Kenyan). Users/RaghavKrishnapriyan

20080906 16:24:44 nbsp Peets has the best black tea, but i love the green tea kims sells. The hojicha they sell is delcious over ice, and it is only 1.50 for 16 tea bags.  the lapsang souchong blend at peets is very good as well, as well as the russian caravan and the green tea with rice in it whose name i have forgotten (all loose leaf, of course).
ive also found no problem in making my tea out of Davis water, but then again, it seems to be popular to hate the Davis tap water, so whatever. water is water and i love tea.
also, if you bring your own tea bag and cup, you can get free hot water at the MU for your tea (or 15 cents if you forget your cup). super cheap. Users/ascapoccia

20091022 20:54:20 nbsp The Tea List has a great selection of fine loose leaf teas from all around the world.  They are at 222 D St (behind The Mustard Seed).   Users/ibirdie
