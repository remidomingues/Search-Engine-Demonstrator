20100318 13:09:39 nbsp Owner is super nice, lowkey. I was looking for a Bananagrams game and though out of stock, he ordered it for me and called me to let me know when it was in. Maybe a little slower than buying it on Amazon.com, but you gotta support your small downtown business or you dont get to have a downtown. Users/Virginia
