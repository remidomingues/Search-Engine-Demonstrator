 >What does it take to be a Davis Peoples Free School teacher?< 

The Davis Peoples Free School is an opportunity for people of ALL AGES to come together to share knowledge in a noncommercial setting to strengthen community. We believe education is a way to achieve equality and freedom. Everybody has something to teach and something to learn. By stepping out of our traditional teacher/pupil roles, we can strengthen selfreliance and the DIY (doityourself) ethic. Only by sharing our skills and talents can we break away from the commodification and hierarchy of society.

 Anyone can teach a class in anything they want! 

The instructor finds a space in house, park, or community center, or gets help finding a space from people who help with organizing the free school.

You dont have to be an expert to hold a workshop!

Being a teacher can just means that you facilitate the workshop.
