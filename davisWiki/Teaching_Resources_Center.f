The http://trc.ucdavis.edu/trc/ Teaching Resources Center is located in 17 Wellman Hall. It provides resources for instructors on campus who are looking to improve their teaching. For example, a teaching assistant or professor can request them to video tape a lecture, and they will provide constructive feedback. They also offer Freshman Seminars which offer the opportunity to study with faculty members in a small group.

The TRC houses many Scantron machines, which are rarely found elsewhere on campus.
