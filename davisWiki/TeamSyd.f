20100331 15:10:12 nbsp ? You keep deleting a personal page of a public davis figure moving comments having to do with that figure to their personal page seems appropriate. Also, why arent relevant 2010 updates ok? just antiquated 2008 information is relevant on the wiki? 2010 additions are not removals. Users/TeamSyd
 The issue is that Im really not feeling motivated to help integrate the information youre adding with the information youre deleting. Maybe someone else will be willing to expend the effort, but I really dont feel like helping someone who is hiding behind the veil of anonymity and is here solely to promote something at the expense of our community. William

What exactly do you think is deleted? Information is simply being added that is consistent with the substance of the 2008 information currently posted. Comments on another public (state) figure is being shifted to that persons page.

20100331 15:13:01 nbsp edits and comments to pages under other pseudonyms seems to be all over this wiki..? Users/TeamSyd
 Those people have ignored our requests that they use their real name. Like I said, close this account and edit under your real name and well talk William
 Yes.  People also spit on the sidewalk and yell profanity at each other in traffic.  That kind of behavior doesnt make for good neighbors either.  Its does not promote trust  unless theres a particular reason  when you go by a strange name to hide behind.  Your neighbors (like William) are understandably loathe to help somebody out when they are intriducing themselves as MassiveToodleBum or TeamGriffin or CheerCheerForSydney... or TeamSyd.  Its just a matter of it being socially offputting and making it difficult to actually communicate with another human being.  Imagine if you walked up to somebody at the Farmers Market and said Hi, my name is TeamSyd!  Even I tend to first introduce myself with Evan before people pick up on my odd nickname.
