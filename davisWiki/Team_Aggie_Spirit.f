Team Aggie Spirit is a group of dedicated engineering, science and business students competing in the http://www.darpa.mil/grandchallenge/  DARPA Grand Challenge.  The Grand Challenge is to design a vehicle capable of traversing up to 175 miles through rough desert terrain in under 10 hours entirely autonomously.  wiki:WikiPedia:Defense_Advanced_Research_Projects_Agency  DARPA gives only a series of GPS points, speed limits and outer boundaries 2 hours before the race.  It is the responsibility of the team to design a vehicle capable of navigating between these points without driving itself off a cliff, getting scared of a bush or any of a thousand http://www.golemgroup.com/results.html other potential problems.
