Team in Training claims to be the worlds largest endurance sports training program. Part of the http://www.lls.org/ Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Team in Training provides running and cycling training to local athletes so they can participate in endurance events such as marathons, centuries or double centuries and triathlons. TNT provides professional coaches and assigns each participant a mentor who has previously participated in an endurance event with the organization; the organization also covers registration and travel costs to events. In exchange for this support, athletes promise to solicit donations for the organization, which funds research to cure blood cancers and aid patients battling those Cancer cancers. There are several opportunities throughout the training to meet team honorees, who are either patients with a blood cancer or cancer survivors.

Most team practices are typically in Sacramento, but you may see some of these people running or biking around Davis as they train for their event, or one might even ask you for a donation.

See our Gyms & Fitness page as well as our Running, Bicycling Advocacy, Swimming and Triathlons pages to find out about other exercise opportunities in the Davis area.
