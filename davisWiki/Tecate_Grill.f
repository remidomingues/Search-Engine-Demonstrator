Tecate Grill Departed Businesses was a Mexican restaurant at 425 2nd Street. Previously Chicos Tacos. A larger taqueriastyle place on the corner of 2nd & D that was busted for serving liquor to minors, lost their liquor license, and soon went belly up. Early supporter of the Aggie Pack. The location is now a financial services place.

Tecate grill closed abruptly in January of 2001 as the franchise owner, Brett Cochran, came upon hard financial times.  Mr. Cochran closed three (Davis, East Sacramento, Roseville) of his four locations (Folsom remained open).  Later that month, Chicos International of Temecula announced that they would be reopening these locations later in the year.  Tecate Grill reopened in the summer of 2001, but the opening was shortlived.


Anyone know exactly when this place closed? I remember going here in 2003.  Users/PhilipNeustrom
  Late 2003 I believe... Users/DavidGrundler
  Doors were locked by June 03, later a note appeared that said it would reopen in a month, the month came and went, the plants dried up, cobwebs covered everything, then they demolished the Mexican murals and put in a law office :^P (I moved here in May 2003, I had visited Tecate Grill regularly when I lived in Folsom and came here for to use the library.  I looked forward to many happy evenings of salsatasting and black bean tacos, but alas my timing was a little too late). Users/TedBuehler
