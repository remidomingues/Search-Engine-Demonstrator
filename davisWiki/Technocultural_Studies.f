The Program in Technocultural Studies (TCS), a new addition to the UC Davis University of California at Davis, is based among the fine and performing arts, literature and cultural studies in the Division of Humanities, Arts and Cultural Studies, and is designed to be open to a diverse range of interests from across the campus.

We concentrate on transdisciplinary approaches to artistic, cultural and scholarly production in contemporary media and digital arts, community media, and mutual concerns of the arts with the scientific and technological disciplines. In contrast to programs which see technology as the primary driving force, we place questions of poetics, aesthetics, history, politics and the environment at the core of our mission. In other words, we emphasize the culture in Technoculture.  http://technoculture.ucdavis.edu/ Source

Vector Webcast Radio was one of the area streaming audio sites. The Technocultural Studies TCS Dept. at UC Davis is responsible for inspiring this work and also for supplying the production workshops which made this possible. Basic HTML will be covered stepbystep in order to demonstrate to the curious novice how to accomplish basic website design using FTP protocol, CSS style sheets, flash animation installation and of course streaming audio.

It was a nonpolitical, demonstrative stream hosted at the nowdefunct carlissimoe.com.  It was part of class TCS 2008.

Students have recently reinstated the Technocultural Studies Club to foster conversations and art beyond the classrooms.

Previously residing in the Art Building, in 2007, the department moved into the remodeled Art Annex building, now known as the Technocultural Studies Building.
