Teds Big Move
  On Feb 25, 2008 Ted shoved off for points north, now residing in Vancouver WA, just north of Portland OR.  Its been good, its been fun, keep bicycling!  And thanks to all my friends who helped me sort stuff/give stuff away when I was packing, and for Morgan for helping me sort, pack, drive (almost all of it), and land this great little house in Vancouver.  (NoteVancouver WA should not be confused with my past residence of http://vancouver.wikispot.org/Front_Page Vancouver BC)

I miss the curry soup and sushi buffets, but theres a 24 hr Mexican shack just down the street, a busy RR yard and Amtrak station a mile away, and lots of gastronomic delights in Portland (hey, wikifairies, wheres the Portland wikispot, BTW?)

Teds Favorite Eats

  Coho  curry soup, tacos, meat chili.  I live for the Thai curry soup.  With all toppings and chicken.  And the meat chili or black bean tacos are the best deal in town.
  Jusco  Lunch.  Buffet.  Sushi.  (my favorite is white tuna, avocado rolls and Philadelphia rolls)
  Sunrise Restaurant #22 (pork over rice$5.25), milkshakes (the best in townI prefer jack fruit, mango, coconut, or durian $23) and possibly an appetizer of pork and shrimp spring rolls.
  Crepeville Bring a friend or two, get the daily special, upgrade the salad to a large salad (Fuji, with blue cheese replaced by feta cheese).  A huge mealits big enough for three, for only $17.  Very macrobiotic.
  InNOut Burger I recommend a double double protein style with grilled onions, extra onions, extra tomatoes, and fries.  Squeeze a fresh lemon on the fries.  $4.35 or so.

Honorable Mentions
  Ali Baba Daily specialsgood for a quick, substantial, reasonably healthy dinner.
  Nobu Hiro  Sushi lunch buffet
  The Old Teahouse  Everything is good, everything kinda tastes the same, but cant go wrong with pork and eggplant or tofu and eggplant.  Open till midnight :^)
  Farmers Kitchen Cafe  Everything on the menu.  The food is as good as the service is bad.  Being wheatfree, the glutenfree sandwiches, tarts, pies and pizzas are a real treat.
  Davis Food Coop hot soup, esp. black bean.  Veggie sushi is good to tide over ones hunger without spoiling your appetite.
  Any of the Thai Restaurants, all seem about the same to me.
  Kathmandu Kitchen  Lunch buffet!
  Yummy Guide Cafe Authentic modern south Asian food.  Rice with fried eggs and ham, mango dessert with tapioca and strawberries.  Its not all good to the North American palate, but its all authentic.

Dearly missed
  Tecate Grill :^(



20070606 08:59:53 nbsp Would it be feasible for you to upload your presentation in its original format (i.e. PowerPoint or whatever). Users/WilliamLewis

20070606 10:55:28 nbsp Simply awesome presentation, Ted! Users/PhilipNeustrom

20070606 16:29:50 nbsp I could upload it as a single document, but I think the individual slide thumbnails work well as a teaser to get people interested.  Its less intimidating to pull up a couple slides than it is to wade through a 50 page Power point presentation.  The slides look good at the 300 pixel size.

Glad you liked the presentation, Phillip, I had a great time putting it together.  Join Davis Bicycles if you want to be part of the change!   Users/TedBuehler

20070606 18:13:25 nbsp the things you and your comrades are doing for the bike community are truly awesome and making a significant impact. thanks for making the slides easily accessible. peace. Users/JessicaRockwell

Daubertthe Mobile Bike Church with the Dr. Seuss style unicycle is great!  Easy and fun to ride, but it goes really slow (nonstandard ergonomics).  Give it a whirl and see what you think.  Peter is indeed the master.  Channelling Theodore Giessel in 3D, reallife, realtime.   Users/TedBuehler

20070904 22:59:01 nbsp Ted, help us out with the Davis Bike Loop page.  Did you pull this off? Users/jefftolentino

20070923 17:57:57 nbsp Great scans!  Just FYI: typically black and white (nongrayscale) images compress better when formatted as a PNG, not a JPEG, file.  This is because PNG is good at noticing the large amount of repeated colors in the image. Users/PhilipNeustrom

20071012 09:30:58 nbsp if you want mike star child to be on the show on monday, hes down. I guess hes at Cristofs if you want to get ahold of him. me and mike can talk about our trip any time, but i think mike is leaving soon... Users/PxlAted

20071229 10:09:26 nbsp Hey, what aspect of the Davis bike lanes became standard across the US?  They certainly vary in traffic pattern from state to state and look visually different.  Im guessing its some sort of civil standard for width versus mph on the vehicle lane?  We had a conversation about bike lanes in IRCFootnote(Which does not indicate plurality; edits are my own!) as a result of trying to figure out the best way to word it; I added some info (basically dropped Bobs name in) and removed some blanket claims just to get clarification (i.e., theres no dispute that the Davis lanes were important in the modern history of bike lanes, just trying to figure out what the particulars are).  It would probably be worth it to have an entire entry on the history of bike lanes in town, as its an interesting (and rather intricate) subject. Users/JabberWokky

Davis had the first bike lanes on streetsin the early 1900s there were lots of bikeways, essentially bicycle highwaysroads built for bikes.  Apparently they were all taken over by cars or met some other unfortunate end.  In the 1960s Davis residents clamored for bikeways on or adjacent to city streets.  There was no precedent for this in the US, and the European model had the bike lanes between parked cars and sidewalks.  The bike lanes built on Sycamore and East 8th were, as far as anyone seems to know, the first bike lanes in the country, and whether they were the first or not, it was the engineering standards developed around these and subsequent bike lanes in Davis that became the national standard.

Ill try to put together a page.

Who were you chatting with in IRC?  Im always interested in what other folks have to say about bike lanes. Users/TedBuehler

20080215 16:36:04 nbsp yaaayyyyyy thanks for putting up the Davis Enterprise link Users/JeremyOgul

20080216 03:41:12 nbsp Hi, sorry I reverted your link to newsbank from the enterprise page. While the Enterprise seems to have an exclusive arrangement with newsbank (I dont know the terms), newsbank has many other sources also and is not what I would call the electronic archive of the enterprise. I expect and hope that the enterprise has some other archive server in their office with whatever prepress electronic file was used to print the paper originally, preserving layout and ads, and allowing them to go away from newsbank in the future. Anyway, I think because that url is so long, it shouldnt be that way in the table at the top of the page and because access to newsbank is complicated as you mentioned, it is better explained in the body of the article. I wrote some more about how to access it and feel free to add your own information. Thanks! Users/NickSchmalenberger

20090529 18:27:34 nbsp Hey, great picture of the California Zephyr. I really enjoyed riding it in September, here are some of my pictures from the trip http://www.flickr.com/photos/stoat50/sets/72157612136712505/ . Did you ride the Zephyr or another train? I also rode the Coast Starlight to Spokane (actually riding a bus from Klamath Falls, ew) and then the Empire Builder to St. Paul, and that was really beautiful too. Users/NickSchmalenberger
