Teen Street Gang was founded on July 1st, 2005, with the intent and mission of getting really drunk amidst the bars in the Mission District in San Francisco.

Needless to say, they succeeded in their endeavours.

(You get the point)


Their adventures are also chronicled in the following photogalleries:
