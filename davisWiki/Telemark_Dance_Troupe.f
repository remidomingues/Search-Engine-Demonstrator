Telemark Dance Troupe is in its 22nd year of choreographed dance performances. Telemark was originally formed from within the UC Davis Ballroom Dance Club and has since become its own group, changing its official name in 1999. Each year Telemark members work with student and professional choreographers on over a dozen ballroom routines in anticipation of our annual spring showcase! Telemark welcomes all dance levels, as all members in a piece will learn the choreography together. As long as you are willing to put in a weekly commitment, no dancing experience is required. Members are allowed to sign up for whichever pieces they are interested in and have time for.

As a nonprofit organization, Telemark members contribute quarterly dues to help offset theater rental costs, thus allowing this student run group to survive and thrive. Dues are $75 a year. Most Telemark members spend anywhere from two to fifteen hours a week practicing for this performance and are extremely dedicated and passionate about social dance. Each years showcase combines many forms of ballroom dance such as swing, salsa, tango, waltz, fox trot, and quick step, as well as lyrical and more modern dance pieces. With over forty active members ranging from beginning dancers to those at a competitive level, Telemark Dance Troupe is an eclectic group of individuals who share a sincere love of dance. We encourage all UCD students and faculty, as well as Davis community members, to attend our showcase and help support our wonderful group of dancers!

We are now recruiting for 20132014, please see our facebook group for more information. Our first meeting of 20132014 will be held on October 8th from 79pm in TCS 107 on campus.


No experience or partner is required, but friends are always welcome.

Ive seen a couple of Telemarks showcase performances, as Ive had friends in the troupe, and they are always very well done.  Im not a huge fan of dance, but Ive always been well entertained.  Users/AlexPomeranz
