 Public Directories 
Generalpurpose telephone directories. The emphasis is on the yellow pages since thats where the publishers make their money (by selling ads). The white pages are just there to induce people to use the directories. If they had their way, theyd eliminate the white pages altogether. With peoples privacy paranoia, this is happening already.
