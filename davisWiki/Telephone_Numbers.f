Davis Telephones Telephone Numbers have certain commonalities.

 Trunk Code 

The trunk code for Davis is 1, which does not have to be dialed locally.

 Area Code 

The Area Codes area code for Davis is 530, which does not have to be dialed locally. However, 530 goes all the way to the Oregon border and a call within the area code is not necessarily local. See http://localcalling.sbc.com/ to see if a  call is local or not, or use the table in the front of the AT&T Telephone Directories phone book. Before 1997, Davis and the rest of the 530 area code were part of 916.

 Exchange Codes 


In the North American phone system the exchange is a block of 10000 phone numbers identified by the 3 digit prefix. Internationally, where phone numbers may be split up differently, exchange may simply refer to a building with phone switches.
Davis landline based exchange codes are:

  297
  750
  753
  756
  757 (City numbers are in the 757 exchange)
  758
  759
  792

Additionally, UC Davis assigned exchange codes are:

  752
  754
  757

 Wireless Carrier Exchange Codes 

  220 TMobile
  400 AT&T (Cingular)
  574 AT&T
  554 (not sure which carrier)
  902 Verizon
  848 Sprint and Boost Mobile

Due to laws governing number portability, consumers have the ability to keep their phone number when switching to a new provider.  Hence, there maybe some observed discrepancies with this list.

 FiveDigit Numbers 
In Davis as late as the 1990s, most phone numbers began with 75, so many people would only write the last 5 digits. This may still be possible within UC Davis. The phone number for the Office of the University Registrar registrar, for example, might be written as 22973. The full number would be (530) 7522973.

20070405 11:45:58 nbsp Anybody know what system UC Davis uses to process and route calls on campus? Users/JabberWokky
  One way to tell is to look at an ISDN modem thats connected to them.  Assuming the modem is working, the configuration will say what kind of switch is in the central office.
