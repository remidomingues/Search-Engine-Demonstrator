 CoHo Telescreen 
On February 3, 2005 the ASUCD Senate passed a bill allocating $33,000 to Creative Media for the purchase of two large flatpanel TV screens to be placed in the Memorial Union.  The purchase was largely at the request of AGTV, which wanted to show its programming on the screens as well as display ads.

This advertisementtvscreen bill caused uproar in the student community, and many complained about the purchase and the fact it would doubtlessly be annoying.  It also sparked interest in the lack of ASUCD open government open government processes in ASUCD, and provided some rage for the creation of the Friends Urging Campus Kindness slate.

The $33,000 ASUCD telescreen ended up in the east end of the Coffee House dining area, hanging above the lounge area where there is a couch, a coffee table and some semicomfortable chairs.
