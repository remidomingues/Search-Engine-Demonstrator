 Alternatives to Traditional TV 
There are a growing number of alternatives to standard television services, usually involving streaming shows over the Internet.  If youre using Mobile Phones data on your cell phone, this can burn through a capped data plan in no time flat.  For a normal Internet Service Providers internet connection, however, its very feasible.  Note that most of the streaming services can be enjoyed through various internetconnected media devices, ranging from BluRay Players to video game systems to smart phones to internetconnected TVs.

  http://netflix.com Netflix  good selection of older shows, mediocre on current programs. Streaming is $8/mo; you can also get DVDs and/or BluRays by mail for $8+/mo
  http://hulu.com Hulu Plus  Hulus basic service isnt stellar, but their paid Hulu Plus has a good selection of current programs. Unfortunately, streaming continues to be adsupported for the premium subscription, which runs around $8/mo. Stuff more than a few seasons old tends to get phased out as well.
  http://Amazon.com Amazon  Free streaming of select videos and TV shows is included with an Amazon Prime membership (does this include Student memberships? Nope, paid Prime only.). The selection is limited but growing.  There are also streaming video rentals and outright purchases available for most new releases of movies and recently aired television episodes.
  http://www.hbogoi.com HBOGo  HBOs streaming service. It is only available with a subscription to HBO through your television service. HBO has some absolutely spectacular series which put most television (and most movies, for that matter) to shame. It aint cheap, though.
