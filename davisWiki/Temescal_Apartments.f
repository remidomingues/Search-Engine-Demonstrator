20070222 18:12:25 nbsp The 2bedroom apartments seem to be very high in demand. I went with my roommate to check out the 1 and 3bedroom units. The layouts are not as thoughtful as we had hoped and the woodburning stove near the foyer continues to boggle me. I suppose if you enjoy burning wood during the 3 weeks that Davis is actually cold enough to warrant it, the stove is a nice amenity in the larger units. AbbYu

20070412 16:32:04 nbsp Stupid 1000character limit!  Temescal is great.  Ive lived in a 3BR/1.5Ba for 3 years and am now in a 2/1.  Prices are reasonable, locations are good.  Great management and maintenance.  The wireless is very slow, but works when SBC goes down.  Great floorplan in the 2BR, decent in the 3BR.  Tons of cabinet space in both.  Big closets.  All in all, great place. Users/TomGarberson

20070921 23:40:05 nbsp Just moved in and internet sucks, anyone know what internet to get that has the best deal? Users/ChrisChen

20070922 00:02:45 nbsp Chris, you might want to take a look at the Broadband page. Users/Graham.Freeman

20070922 02:15:19 nbsp Yeah the internet at Temescal is not reliable. Definitely want to get your own ISP, especially if you like to procrastinate on research papers and whatnot. Users/KaiWan

20090331 11:46:04 nbsp The initial system that was installed did have problems and management has changed the system to accomodate to number of residents using the internet.  Temescal has installed 2 DSL lines with 8 meraki repeaters.  There have been no complaints from our residents since upgrading last year.  The management encourages residents to notify them if they do experience problems.   Users/Management

20100706 02:14:07 nbsp I hate the parking lot here at Temescal. Theres ALWAYS (except during summer when its empty) at least 3 cars who do not have a parking permit to be found parked in the lot. Its so frustrating when I, being at tenant, cannot park in my own parking lot because other people visiting are taking up spaces. Its not like I could park on the street, theres never any spaces! They definitely do not enforce the parking permit requirement, so why should I even have given the office the information on my car and stuck some sticker on my windshield if theres absolutely no risk of being towed? Users/KaprilWooley

20100819 21:30:14 nbsp The wood burning stove is tacky and oddly placed, as are some random alcoves of the 3br that I live in. Management has been reliable and helpful the few times there were problems. The apartments are older and yeah, if you want to watch movies or tv online get your own internet. Its a nice place to live though the apartments are kinda old. Users/argyle

20110304 17:06:03 nbsp Over the December break temescal upgraded the internet again they now have a 20 meg system. I have lived here for several years and I still like it. Users/kenbrown
      FYI, Ken Brown is the assistant manager at Temescal  Users/argyle

20110524 16:16:29 nbsp Awesome place, the managers are very nice people! Just a heads for you people who tend to get packages a lot, they will not sign for packages. Not their fault, more of the parent management company. >.< Users/TheO

20110714 17:03:03 nbsp Temescal Apartments is really old and run down. The managers here are incompetent and really rude towards students. Users/LukeShiver

20140515 12:47:46 nbsp This is my third year living in a four bedroom apartment here. I love it. The managers are nice, the location is great. In general a nice pace for a student to live, much better than half of the other apartment complexes in Davis. Users/sosoli

20140617 00:10:39 nbsp Lived in a 4 Bedroom Townhouse: the managers were pretty friendly and easygoing; maintenance was prompt; parking is ample (with gravel overflow, should be asphalt!); buildings are on the older side; the whole house fan was actually really useful; Temescal wifi sucked; Comcast was great because since the complex includes cable TV, our Blast Plus connection was heavily discounted; right in front of the G and J line; right next to the Marketplace; laundry is $1 Dry/Wash; kitchen stove was gas fueled; afterhours clubhouse access is annoying to deal with (you have to check in every week).
7.5/10 would recommend. Users/compmix
