As of late, I have been converting the information tables at the top of pages from a http://daviswiki.org/Taqueria_Guadalajara?actionrecall&version147 single column deal to http://daviswiki.org/Taqueria_Guadalajara?actionrecall&version156 multiple columns. The situations where a single column data table is best are the rare exceptions, certainly not the rule. The single column unnecessarily makes the page longer, requiring more scrolling to get to the article text. While the TQ page is a custom job, most pages could start off much better by using two columns. (http://daviswiki.org/Stonegate_Village_Apartments?actionrecall&version23 Before, http://daviswiki.org/Stonegate_Village_Apartments?actionrecall&version24 After). I believe that the templates themselves should be of this new two column design and we can revert back to the old 1 column design where appropriate. However, some objections have been raised. Some people think that the two column templates are too hard for the novice to update. My response is that the two column tables arent significantly more confusing than then one column tables. As always, gnomes will fix the mistakes of the newbies. Also, I think having two templates, Templates/Business one one col, Templates/Business Two Column Layout one two col, is more confusing than editing the two col layout. What do you guys think?

I like the 2 col template a lot; it is easier to read and I dont like scrolling down, especially with the apartment complex pages which include so much information on amenities. If there are a large number of people who want to retain the 1 col standard, why not just use the 2 col as the apartment complex template? It seems to me thats where its most needed.
I do think that when the 2 col template is used for the apartment complexes, its necessary to keep amenities in the same basic order so that its easier to tell when somethings missing, rather than just list them in any order. Users/ElleWeber


Hi folks,
As of late when I make a new page they pretty much always have
{{{
}}}
Can we just include these two includes in templates / new pages so they have them by default?
Another thing that I believe new users would find helpful would be including some form of commenting that explains what they do
Kinda like
{{{
##This include shows that the page is a seed, from which others can help it grow!
## This include signals a request for a photo, and helps photographers know what entries need pics!
}}}
##This shows that the page is a seed, from which others can help it grow!
## This shows a request for a photo, and helps keen photographers know what entries need pictures!
Anyone feel free to adjust the phrasing of the code comment, this is rather rough draft
Thanks Daubert
## Hi JW what do you think? (you dont necessarily have to be JW to provide input)
  Seems like a nobrainer.  Id say, just do it.  cp
  Id just add information to seed saying something like You can expand by taking photos, adding information or telling your personal stories about this topic or something like that.  Basically, if its a seed, adding photos is one way to expand it out.  On the other hand, there are some very complete entries that only need some photos taken.  But thats just a thought.  Either way, adding some helpful guidance text to the seed include is probably a good idea anyway.  jw
    I like the suggestion of adding the text that jw suggests to the seed include.  cp


  Id like to see an area for Handicap Accessible put in the business template. Users/PeteB
   Good idea.  (Should it be Handicapped Accessible?).  Perhaps with a link to the Mobility Impaired Access page.  cp
     How many places in Davis are not?  This isnt the east coast where buildings are old and exempt; the California DA is pretty aggressive about retrofitting.  Might it make sense to do the inverse?   Im certainly not against adding information, especially useful information like this, but if we do, Id propose putting it outside of the header, which is getting quite unwieldy.  Actually, Id like to see several of the items moved down into the prose anyway... if everything is listed in an at a glance tabular format, none of the information is highlighted, nor visible at a glance. jw
      I agree that there are too many items in the header table now.  For example, the owners name and the date founded are probably better off in the text.  (That being said, having the info in the table does encourage its provision).  However, perhaps accessibility is something that people out to be able to see at a glance.  There is need for it, as the MIA page shows.  However, that page also shows that the issue is more complicated than a simple yes or no.  cp, appreciating two sides of issues this evening.
