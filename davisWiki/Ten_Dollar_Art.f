Ten Dollar Art was a comic in The California Aggie drawn by English and Design student Jackson Pritt.  The comic ran for three years, from Fall 2000 until Fall 2003.  The title of the comic, Ten Dollar Art, was a reference to the amount of pay a cartoonist for the aggie got per comic ($10).  The comic featured all sorts of wacky things that didnt make a whole lot of sense, as well as frequently and timely references to UC Davis and Davis life.  The comic was largely considered the best in the paper at the time.
