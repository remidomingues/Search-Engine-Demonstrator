Tenaya Freitas has been cutting and coloring hair since 1993,  and has been working in Davis since 1999. Her motto is Artistic Cuts and Beautiful Color.

As Tenaya puts it, My clients come to me for great hair color, my easytostyle haircuts, and good communication skills (so important when it comes to finding that perfect color or haircut). Whether you have short hair, long hair, curly hair, or straight hair, male, or female... I can work with your hair. I have been trained extensively in color techniques. I have been to many advanced color classes and continue to receive ongoing education.

If youd like color, please call for a free consultation.

20070609 16:13:00 nbsp Tenaya has been my hairstylist for over six years. Not only is she a fabulously talented stylist and colorist, but she is also quick and very personable.  Tenaya and I have become close friends over the years and I can attest to the fact that her integrity is stellar!  She has all the qualities you should look for in a professional: integrity, skill, efficiency, and personality.   Users/Serena

20070624 01:12:54 nbsp Ive worked with Tenaya for almost 10 years. She is not only talented, but HONEST and direct.  She will not steer you wrong.  I recommend her highly, and she does my hair!!  David Martin

20070726 12:21:41 nbsp I was very pleased with my haircut by Tenaya.  It turned out great and it was a fun experience.  If you are scared of haircuts or fashiony things like that, she is a great person to go to. Users/Elise

20070901 20:54:36 nbsp Tenaya is the best!!!  Love the way she cuts and colors my hair, but conversation is always entertaining!  :) Users/Dsigncards

20071205 22:01:36 nbsp I feel beautiful everytime Tenaya does my hair! Everything surrounding her and everything she touches becomes more beautiful. Its interesting how feeling beautiful on the outside can make you feel beautiful on the inside. The world needs more Tenayas. Users/TBOWEN

20080528 23:17 nbsp Tenaya is wonderful! I was there today for the first time and she did a fantasitic job with my hair! Not only that but she kept up a friendly conversation which made me feel comfortable and relaxed with her. Great job with my highlights and great cut! I walked out feeling like my hair looked  really good and felt like it still looks good after I washed it at home and didnt have anyone to style it for me, so that should say something ;) I would definately recommend Tenaya and will definately be going back.

20090630 18:38:57 nbsp Tenaya is amazing!  After trying 7 different salons and my hair growing shorter each time, even though I wanted it to grow longer, I finally found Tenaya. I have too much hair and it can stick out like a frizzy pyramid, if its done wrong.  She listened to me, added her expertise to the mix, and I finally like my hair again!   And she is fantastic at color.  She highlights my hair, (I call it naturalizing) and it looks... natural!  Thank you Tenaya!!! Users/Deer

20110220 21:04:58 nbsp Tenaya is incredible! She always gives me an amazing haircut that doesnt just look great the day of it continues to look wonderful the next day and as it grows back out. I have really thick hair that used to always be poofy and fluffy. But Tenaya somehow brings it under control. She works with your hair so that your hair works with you. Which is nice if you dont want to have to spend half an hour styling everyday... Shes a really nice person, too! Users/SomeOneHere

20120403 09:41:37 nbsp I am so happy with my haircut from Tenaya.  I went with a super short pixie cut from almost shoulder length head of hair.  I originally was going to get allovercolor and do the free haircut.  Since I was cutting so much off, we did that first.  What was left was my natural hair color since I had been growing out my dyed hair.  I couldnt believe how much darker my hair was now.  We decided I didnt need the color and the short cut was enough of a change.  I am so excited about this new style.  Its like a million little pieces, layers upon layers like a work of art!  I also bought some spray on wax for $15 and that has helped me style, spike it the way I like it.  I would definitely recommend the pixie hair cut for anyone looking for something new.  So much potential!  Thanks Tenaya! Users/JenniferStanton

20121004 21:18:48 nbsp Tenaya has cut my hair for 7 years. I have thin, boring hair that has always previously required styling  which I hate doing. With Tenayas haircut, I dont have to do anything other than brush it in the morning and I always get lots of compliments! I cheated and went somewhere else once, and regretted every moment of waiting for that cut to grow out so I could get my easy, manageable haircut back from Tenaya. I would reccomend her to anyone.
