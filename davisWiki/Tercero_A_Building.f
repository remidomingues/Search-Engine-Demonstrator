 Haunted 
According to legend, A building was haunted, which was why residents there host the annual Haunted House for Tercero Residence Halls Tercero every Halloween.  There are several stories about A Buildings strange history. The following are two of the most wellknown:

The Suicide: It is rumored that years ago, a resident hung herself in one of the first floor rooms due to stress with her classes & home environment. Since then, strange events have been reported on the first floor like residents who can hear the faint sound of a sobbing girl late at night.

The FaceofDeath Stories: Before being painted in 2004, the Tercero buildings were all eggshell in color.  On the underside of the third floor sunscreen outside Room 305, there appeared to be the image of a face.  Legend has it that Student Housing repeatedly attempted to paint over the handdrawn face but it continued to mysteriously reappear through the paint! (Apparently, they succeeded in covering the Urban Art graffiti in 2004, when all the Tercero buildings were painted in a darker shade.)  But whos face was it? Who drew it & why?

The main story goes...
Years ago, two identical twin girls lived in that room.  Late one night, one of the sisters was out at her boyfriends residence while the other was asleep in their room. The one asleep suddenly woke up in the middle of the night, opened her window, leaned out from her bed, and began to draw the image of a face on the underside of the sunscreen. She didnt know what possessed her to do it but she couldnt make herself stop. When she finished the drawing, she noticed that the picture resembled her own likeness.  As curious as she was, she shrugged it off and went back to sleep.  Early the next morning, the girl was awakened by the ring of her telephone.  It was her mother, calling to tell her that her twin sister had been killed in a car accident while coming home from her boyfriends house.  Apparently, her sisters death happened at the precise time when she drew the image of the face.
Other versions of the story continue on to say that the surviving twin was so stricken with grief over her sisters death that she lept to her death from the third floor window.

Further variations of this story can be found on the Urban Legends page.
