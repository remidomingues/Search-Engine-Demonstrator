Tercero D Building was a Residence Halls residence hall located in the Thille Hall section of the Tercero Residence Halls Tercero Housing Area until its demolition in March 2012. It was an International Relations/Volunteer Opportunities Community Service based Residence Halls residence hall, although one does not have to be an International Relations major to live there. Besides the official name (Thille D) it was also called wiki:wikipedia:Dag_Hammarskjöld Hammarskjöld House, or Hamm House for short. The building had two Resident Advisors RAs, approximately 7075 freshmen residents, and there was also a Service Programmer.

The universal theme of the house is to broaden awareness of international issues and provide opportunities for involvement in international exchanges and cultures. Activities range from international dinners to gettogethers with professors and teaching assistants. Informal discussions of recent world news, foreign language practice, travel tips, debates, and lectures are the kinds of events sponsored to help residents learn about the world in which we live.

 Service Program Opportunities 
To comply with the community service theme, each year the Service Programmer coordinates several community service events for the residence hall. These include programs like Relay for Life, March of Dimes, volunteering at the ASPCA, and planting trees in the Arboretum. In 2004, for example, 12 residents donated 10 inches of their own hair to the http://www.locksoflove.org Locks of Love foundation that makes wigs from donated hair for children with cancer.

 The Flags 
From the outside of the building, the International Relations theme was not apparent. However, once you stepped inside, the International Relations connection became instantly clear. For years, the flags from countries all over the world lined the hallway walls. Before that, flags were flown from the roof of the building (the holders are still visible from outside). The residents of the 20032004 school year repainted and updated nearly all of the flags (because certain countries no longer existed, many names were misspelled, etc.), and it took them nearly 20 weeks to finish. A new mural of a map of the world was also painted that year by the residents. Each country had its flag painted within its borders and can be found on the second floor. Photo request, 2nd floor mural During summer 2005, Student Housing placed corkboard and drilled holes into the hallways with little regard for the state of the flags. Complaints to the Community Leadership Coordinator of Tercero were answered in late Fall 2005 with the hiring of a professional painter to move and repaint those flags that had been damaged.  During the 20052006 year, the painters moved those flags by repainting them in the hallways of the first and second floors.

All in all, these flags represented 155 nations.  There are 194 nations total in the world (2005). Can you guess which ones were not represented?
In December 2005, a certain nation decided to adopt a new flag, thereby outdating one of the painted flags. Can you guess which nation?

 Other Murals 
The mural of the comfy chair & lamp, which appears on the third floor, was painted in the 20022003 school year by a student with a dream.

 A Cow Haunting 
In the 1980s, a group of DBuilding residents stole a cow late one night from the local The Dairy Dairy Cattle Facility and led it up the stairway to heaven (which refers to the steps leading up to the roof of D Building).  They were attempting to test the fact that it is possible to lead a cow upstairs but impossible to lead it downstairs because a cows knees cannot bend properly to walk back down.  The cow was led onto the roof with little difficulty but sure enough, it could not walk back down. Because student housing Student Housing could not figure out a way to remove the cow from the roof, it was decided that she would have to be killed on location... and so, she was.  Now it is said that on clear nights, if you sit quietly on the stairway to heaven, you can hear the faint moos of dear Betsys ghost... the cow.... that DIED on the roof.

20120619 22:18:53 nbsp I just wanted to correct the information about the comfy chair mural.  My friend Sarah and I painted the mural our freshman year (9697).  We were inspired by a chair Sarah found and was not able to keep in the hallway of the 3rd floor.  We painted the mural to pay homage to the chair we were forced to get rid of.  We were also The center picture of the mural also included an International cow, inspired by our Tercero bovine neighbors. Since we lived in the Hammarskjold House, we made the cows spots in the shape of the continents.   Users/ChristinaOrsi
