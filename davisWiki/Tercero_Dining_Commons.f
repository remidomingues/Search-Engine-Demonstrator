The Tercero Residence Halls Tercero dining commons, operated by Sodexo, serves mostly Freshmen freshmen living in the Tercero Residence Halls Tercero area, though you will occasionally see upperclassmen venture over. The building contains a printing station, convenience store called Trudys (with great smoothies), as well as an Area Service Desk. Supposedly, the Tercero Residence Halls Tercero Dining Commons is the tastiest of the the Residence Halls residence hall cafeterias. Unlike Segundo Dining Commons Segundo DC, lines are fairly short and there is always a place to sit.

There is also an unofficial contest among many Freshmen freshmen to see who can steal the biggest and the best thing from the dining commons. Most only get away with little things like silverware and salt shakers. As to Users/AbbyLawson my knowledge, the largest completed theft was 4 chairs taken at once, and the largest attempted theft was the quesadilla grill while someone stole a DC employee. Anybody beat this?

The existing dining commons were remodeled in 2005, and a new section was University Construction built to meet the increased number of students residing in Tercero following the completion of the new Tercero South Residence Halls Tercero South dorms in late 2005.  However, due to wiki:WikiPedia:asbestos asbestos presence in the flooring and pipe insulation of the building, it was not ready to be reopened for Fall 2005.  This meant that the hundreds of Freshman that were designated to use it were instead directed to the newlyrebuilt Segundo Dining Commons. The dining commons opened again for full service on Monday, January 2, 2006 for dinner. The remodel included a larger dining area, updated food preparation facilities, an expanded Learning Resource Center, a new Academic Advising Center, and an increase in both recreation and study space.


I thought this place was pretty disgusting. They somehow even managed to screw up breakfast with spoiled milk and soggy fruit. My Freshmen freshman year, I was getting salad and I saw a lady bug crawling around in the lettuce at the salad bar. I tried to warn the guy in front of me, but he didnt listen and scooped up the lady bug. Mmm protein. Another guy ordered a burger from the grill and found a caterpillar in it! When he complained to one of the Sodexho employees, they simply replied, Well, at least you know its organic. Users/AbbyLawson

20060205 16:59:11 nbsp It seems that a fair number of faculty/staff members eat lunch at this; a colleague in the Genome Centre er, Im back in the US; I need to remember that its a Center, not a Centre mentioned that since the food in the Med School part of camups sucks, and its so far from the parts of campus that have restaurants on their border, its practically their default.  Dunno how generally true that is.  The time that I went was nothing special, though at $5.75, its not too expensive. Users/DanielBrown

20061025 22:32:46 nbsp I love Tercero DC, I hate that 50% of the time there is no juice.  I go for the milk though. Users/GregWebb

20070203 21:28:59 nbsp People who work here are very grumpy with the exception of the person who swipes you in. Users/KaiWan

20070204 11:01:33 nbsp Our year (20012002) some students rolled a whole table out of the DC.  I think that should top the largest items stolen from the Tercero DC. Users/RohiniJasavala

20080521 21:56:04 nbsp A COMMENT ABOUT TRUDYS SINCE IT LACKS A COMMENT BOX:
TRUDYS IS A FUCKING SHITHOLE.
EVERYTIME I GO THERE, I COME BACK MORE DEPRESSED AND IT DRAINS MY SOUL OF WHAT LITTLE  JOY AND HAPPINESS MY INSANE CLASSES BRING ME.
Only ONE of the employees there is actually exceptional, all of the others are rude and/or utterly incompetent. Then again, anyone who willingly chooses to work at an establishment like trudys would probably intolerable to begin with. They have the worst vegetarian options IF ANY. Dont even get me started on their price markup.
If Trudys actually tried to appreciate their customers and provide a service that was genuinely interested in the well being of the students maybe I would change my opinion.
As for now and the foreseeable future, it doesnt seem like there is any chance of that happening.  Users/triscuitqueen

20110517 17:35:56 nbsp I hated the structure of tercero dining commons. The lights were too bright, those who sit alone are easily noticed, lots of people go there in enormous packs, and it can be overwhelming to walk through after 30 minutes of opening. The breakfast foods are limited, and the working staff there are analretentive. On the plus side however, they usually play good oldies music, the swipes person Anne is really nice, and sometimes they served good food even though it is all expensive. Users/Chelsea744

20110622 00:15:11 nbsp Great place. In my opinion, better than Segundo (Quarto dining commons are so bad, they arent even considered) because there is less people and better food a majority of times.  Users/JohnathonJosephs
