Tercero F building was often referred to as Farmhouse.  It used to house the Communications Academic Theme Programs Academic Theme Program. Some said its official motto was F all day, F all night, yet this may be dated. There may or may not be sexual connotations involved. The building was demolished in March 2012.

F building also had someone running for ASUCD office every quarter from November 2001February 2004 (please ignore Fall 2004)


 Is this true? I lived there 20022003, and I dont remember anybody running for anything.  Granted, I didnt pay much attention either.  Users/DavidKoppel

Yea I live in Tercero last year and we didnt have any ASUCD candidates.

 Ive never heard that motto, Ill do some research next week during Willing of the Halls  Im an RA 0506 in Tercero F building. Also this building is in Pierce, not Thielle. Users/VinceBuffalo

No, F building is in Thille, but it was spelled Theille or Thielle when I lived there from 7678.  Maybe they changed the spelling to ease pronunciation.  Megan
