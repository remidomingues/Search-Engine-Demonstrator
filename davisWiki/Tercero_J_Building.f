J Building was located closest to the campus core, and one of the farthest from the dairy cattle facility, until its demolition in March 2012. Although freakish east winds gave it a front row seat to the stench of the now relocated Hog Barn.

J building was remodeled during the 9192 school year. Among the changes were any murals (if there were any) were painted over, and it had the first microwave in a common area for Tercero.

The second floor was the all male floor from 9294 at least.  Due to the alternating floor restroom arrangements this meant the only mens showers were on the second floor.  And as floors 1 and 3 were coed, it meant 50 guys shared 1 restroom and 4 shower stalls, while 20 girls had 2 restrooms to choose from.
