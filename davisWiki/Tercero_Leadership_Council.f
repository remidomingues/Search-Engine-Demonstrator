The Tercero Leadership Council, often referred to as TLC, is a group of Tercero residents who get together to plan area wide events. This group is advised by Dominique Beaumonte.

They meet every Monday at 7pm in the Tercero Main Lounge.  Some events that it puts on include a themed dance, baking event and others in addition to volunteer work.

The Tercero Leadership Council also works in coordination with the Segundo Leadership and Activities Council and the Cuarto Leadership Council to put on the residence hall winter formal. The winter formal for this school year will be held on February 8th, 2008 in Freeborn Hall.
