Communities and Buildings

Tercero Living

One of the benefits of living in Tercero is its proximity to the Arboretum  only about a five minute walk until you reach Putah Creek Lodge.

Though debatable, the Tercero Dining Commons Tercero DC is supposedly the best of the four dining commons operated by Sodexho, and was expanded and renovated in 2005. It is far less busy than the Segundo Dining Commons, which was rebuilt in 2004. One can easily walk into the Tercero DC at 6pm, get their food quickly and find a seat... you wont have that same luck at the Segundo DC!

Tercero is also a hot spot for tree climbing, so if you are a monkey at heart, Tercero is the place to be!

Warning: Some people complain about the Essence of Davis cow smell in Tercero. This is because of Terceros proximity to the The Dairy Dairy Cattle Facility, just one street west and a small parking lot away.  Under certain weather conditions the smell can intensify and definitely be disturbing, usually in the early morning or late night hours. On most days, however, it wont be a problem at all. To combat this smell, acquire a potion of Olfactory Suppression, one of the Magic Items of Davis.  But, as much as some people complain about the smell, its usually not that intense and entirely tolerable.

Proximity to the cow barns is convenient for several reasons: a) You can sleep on the hay stacks if your roommate wants to be alone with his/her boyfriend or girlfriend, or you can bring yours out there, b) there is a refrigerator in a lit room that always seems to be unoccupied by any people and that seems to be open all night... it contains a various assortment of food... c) cows are nice and make for good alternatives to humans if your friends are getting on your nerves (and they are less resistant to giving milk).
