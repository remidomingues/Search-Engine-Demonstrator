Tercero South Phase II was the second of three phases in the construction of Tercero South Residence Halls Tercero South. It involved the construction of three fourstory residence hallsWall Hall, Campbell Hall, and Potter Hallproviding beds for 579 freshmen and 12 RAs. It is located south of the Tercero Dining Commons on the corner of Dairy Road and La Rue Road. The total approved budget for Phase II was $55,168,000. The building cost per bed was estimated at $71,244. Funding for the construction came from University of California Housing System revenues and external financing (loans).

Tercero South II opened in Fall 2010, with the first batch of freshmen to grace the three buildings being the graduating class of 2014. The buildings match Laben Hall and Kearney Hall in style and color, and share a small courtyard similar to that between Laben and Kearney.

One of the purely aesthetic features of the new dorms is an incredibly large metalframed awning hanging over the side of Wall hall next to Laben. The awning shelters students from rain and sun, and roofs a large glasswalled lounge for all of Tercero II.

Much like the dorms in Phase One of Tercero South Residence Halls Tercero South, many of these dorms are perfectly situated to catch the best whiff of the Essence of Davis.

    From what Ive been told, they are planning on tearing down either Leach Hall or Thille Hall and Pierce Hall in order to make room for Tercero III (the buildings would be more matches of Laben and Kearney). Users/AshleyMatson
