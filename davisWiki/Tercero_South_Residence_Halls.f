Opened in fall 2005, Tercero South is a $26 million dollar facility; the first class to live there was the incoming freshman class of 2009 during the 20052006 school year. Buildings 1 and 2 are now named Patricia Kearney Hall and Robert Laben Hall, respectively.

During the 20062007 academic year, because of the largest incoming freshmen class in Davis history, 388 rooms in Segundo North and Tercero South were converted from double occupancy rooms (two people per room) to triple occupancy rooms (three people per room).

The Tercero South Residence Halls were University Construction built on the site of the former Tercero IM Field.  The construction was easily noticed by residents in the nearby Tercero B Building. Upon completion, Tercero South became the most Essence of Davis fragrant of all UCD residence halls due to its close proximity to cows.

The new buildings were completed by September 2005. They hold 400 students in double occupancy clusters similar to the infills at Segundo North.

I walked around these dorms at the beginning of the quarter and they seem huge.  The hallways are much wider and the rooms seem more spacious.  The freshmen are living pretty here.  Users/BenWebber
