Prior to closing, this was a cheap place to get some grub, especially if you lived in the Dorms and were tired of the Dining Commons!  This place gave you a bowl full of chicken, beef, shrimp, fried tofu, veggies, or combo of chicken and beef  all covered in teriyaki sauce and over rice. Seriously good stuff. Slathering the meat/rice bowl in Hot Sauce provided a good treat, too. Sushi was also served here, although it was premade and not spectacular.

What was the difference between a bowl and a plate? A plate had a somewhat larger serving of meat, rice, and vegetables, and came with a small salad and an orange wedge. Bowls had no salad or orange. Veggies were steamed cabbage, broccoli, zucchini, and carrot. Chicken was dark meat, beef was tasty and flavorful. Sesame chicken and tofu were pankobreaded and friedit looked like Tofu Nuggets, but it was tasty when dipped in the teriyaki sauce.


 Closure 

In midOctober, 2006, owner Wayne Yu received a 30day eviction notice from University Mall owner Centro Watt, who is trying to make room for Trader Joes by moving Radiological Associates of Sacramento into the building. It is highly unlikely RAS will choose this location, however.Footnote(St. John, Claire. http://www.davisenterprise.com/articles/2006/10/18/news/074new2.txt Council OKs store.

My coworkers at Gottschalks have informed me that Teriyaki Express, along with La Esperanza, will be closing at the end of May 2007. The restaurant is closing because the mall management is going to raise the rent significantly. Rent increases in this shopping center have already driven out Island Inkjet and Max Muscle.

20051205 08:26:08 nbsp Ate here this past Friday for the first time in... 10 years, maybe?  It was better than I remembered.  A decent amount of food for the price, and the service was extremely quick.  Will return when Im craving some quick teriyaki.  I had the combo bowl: the chicken was fair, the beef was excellent. Users/AlexPomeranz

20060107 15:46:31 nbsp Extremely fast and pretty cheap.  Havent been there in several weeks due to winter break, but it should still be $3.93 for a chicken bowl to go ($ includes tax). Users/PatrickSing

20060330 18:30:40 nbsp I love this restaurant. I use to live in Davis and worked at the University Mall. Ive since moved to North Carolina and can find no where else that else that same unique teriyaki sauce that you guys have. I wish I knew the recipe. Users/RyanRuiz

20060330 18:38:09 nbsp Went there for lunch today, and it really hit the spot.  Awesome food for next to nothing! Users/JulienBiewerElstob

20060811 21:40:27 nbsp Had it for the first time today!  Had the chicken teriyaki bowl and really liked it.  I will for sure go back in the future and hopefully with coupons this time!  Good with the hot sauce and I even had leftovers! Users/KatYu

20061003 19:33:12 nbsp I <3 chicken teriyaki bowls. Users/JackWaller

20061009 16:31:01 nbsp Super fast and gives you a LOT. Its not something you can eat everyday and not get tired since there isnt too many choices on the menu. But definitely go if you want something speedy and delicious. Users/KiwiSelina

20061020 15:59:44 nbsp Teriyaki Chicken is great. THE VEGETABles are lacking, watch if the asian kids overcharge your credit card, sometimes they DO! Users/VietnameseStudentAssociation

20061021 12:05:41 nbsp I just ate there yesterday for the first time. I cant believe Ive been missing out on all this cheap goodness. Users/AlJean

20061126 14:57:14 nbsp the rice is not loose! yessss. fast, filling, cheap, good. Users/YooHyunOak

20070126 14:03:29 nbsp love going to this place. At first the people working there were weird with me, but since ive been a customer a few times they remember me and are pretty ok. I love their food because its so cheap and tastes alright considering the low price. Its very very fast. Users/KimberlyMiller

20070206 12:54:15 nbsp Cheap! Fast! cant beat that. Users/AvilaVoom

20070208 23:52:05 nbsp The food is good for the price, and the service is really fast. I love their teriyaki chicken bowl. The place feels a little rundown, but thats probably how the owner keeps the prices low. I do wish they would bring back bowl containers; they now serve their togo teriyaki chicken bowl in a box. The box is awkward to transport, and I inevitably end up with the yummy sauce all over the inside of the bag. But T.E. is definitely one of my favorite onthego lunchtime spots. Users/RobinLaughlin

20070222 22:02:32 nbsp Super fast and really cheap compared to Old Teahouse next door. Definitely recommended if you need some filling food fast. Users/AbbYu

20070227 23:56:39 nbsp Im a regular here, and I come whenever I have lunch breaks from Rite Aid.  Good food, good service, and real speedy; what more could you want? Users/AlexanderHo

20070315 17:34:04 nbsp One of the best eats in Davis. Pricing is very cheap which is good for a student. Health wise it contains a good amount of nutrition. I enjoy getting the Teriyaki Chicken plate with extra sauce.  Users/BrandonToo

20070318 19:07:29 nbsp like everyone is saying, super fast, cheap, and reasonably good, and at least somewhat healthy (although the chicken is not the best quality and the sauce is loaded with sugar).  Over all i was pleasantly surprised.  I will return sometime. Users/MattHh

20070508 07:43:25 nbsp Oh NO!  They shouldnt do that!  Teriyaki Express is the best place in town to get a good healthy meal for a decent price.  All the time freshman year, Id buy a plate and split it so it would be two meals.  And even still today, when I need a quick but fulfilling meal, I just go over to Teriyaki Express.  I guess Ill be heading back one more time to get my free bowl with my card. Users/JoAnnaRich

20070517 19:42:24 nbsp BOOOO, this is where me. Ben Rosenstein and Chris T saw Stack keibler of the WWF... This place shouldnt close Users/StevenDaubert

20070530 13:18:51 nbsp Went there last night, everything was moved out and packed up.  Sad.  JoAnna said it well.  The best place in town for a good cheap meal.  I hope they can find a new Davis location. Users/GrumpyoldGeek

20070531 01:03:59 nbsp As a weight trainer, I used to stop by Terikaki Express for a chicken plate (sometimes salmon plate) to fuel myself up before/after I go to ARC.  The store is closed to ARC.  The food is  cheap with great amount of stuff and nutrition.  Now what, Teriyaki is closed down because of that hungry landlord.  This is the most shocking news in Davis city this year, even the oncampus protest is nothing copmpared to this disastrous incident.  Where else should we get such great deal of food? Users/thebigshow500

20070602 23:17:54 nbsp NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.

Seriously, I went here every lunch break from work to eat.  Where am I supposed to eat now?

God dammit. Users/AlexanderHo

20070602 23:46:06 nbsp I love T.E. and it makes me really sad that theyre closed. Any news of them reopening somewhere else? Where else are we suppose to get cheap and delicious  Teriyaki close to campus  Users/DavidHolcomb

20070603 10:06:28 nbsp I liked Island Inkjet. Now theyre driving the Teriyaki Express away? Culpepper Used Books is probably next. Oh man, Im not liking the University Mall management right now. :( Users/NumiaCairaguas

20070603 11:22:44 nbsp I have heard that the owners of TE want to stay in Davis and are actively searching out a new place to set up shop. No clue on how soon they would be able to do that but a friend of mine who was working there when it shut down was told to expect a phone call when the new location was found. I hope that means they are getting a place soon and not stringing him out too far. Users/CraigFergus

20070610 15:50:33 nbsp awww. today i went here for food and saw it was closed.  (   i liked this place!! Users/JessicaRockwell

20070612 22:43:53 nbsp They were kicked out by the Money Hungry Landlord. Thats what they wrote on the window. Users/AvilaVoom

20071116 07:56:34 nbsp Good riddance.  I went to this place only once.  It was GROSS, complete with blubbery, WET, chicken.  Never went back. Users/AnnieSirrah

20080427 08:02:56 nbsp Besides the Arc, this is my most missed Davis experience ~ I used to get the large with no rice and extra meat. Great eats for an awesome price and nice portions. RiP Teriyaki Express ~  Users/FrankYoung
