The Terminal Hotel was a building in downtown Davis that first opened its doors in 1922. In its heyday (1927), it housed a hotel on the second floor (later known as Hotel Aggie), cafe, meat market, and Greyhound bus station.  For many years, it was the only Davis establishment to be open all night on a regular basis. It was generally seen as the hangout place for all the cool people.  Sadly , the building was demolished in the year 2000 and replaced by the Chen Building. John Lofland wrote a book, Demolishing a Historic Hotel: A Sociology of Preservation Failures in Davis, California Demolishing a Historic Hotel, about the history and demise of the Terminal Building.   The building, along with its Terminal Cafe, can be seen in a http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/tf6z09n9hw/?&brandoac 1944 photo of Davis Main Street from Eastmans Originals Collection.

It was owned by Tingus and Belenis until 1946.

It was home to Natural Food Works and La Esperanza and had the Davis Arch mural painted on the north side.
