20090305 21:23:17 nbsp I have to post something here.  The manager here is completely immoral and abuses her powers (the Caucasian woman, long hair, fake nails).  I had a dispute with my roommate and she ended up kicking me out of the apartment.  I was not on the lease because the manager ADVISED US that I should not be put on the lease or else we wouldnt qualify to live there.  When i approached her for help after the roommate situation, she claimed that she did no such thing (when she was the one who FORGED my other roommates signature).  I even had the management company get involved, but of course, in an effort to avoid a legal suit filed against them, they sided with the manager.  I REALLY wish I had some sort of evidence so that I could get this lady fired and have some serious action taken against the management company.

I am completely over this situation.  I lost about $1000 dollars, and so did my other roommate, but what could we possibly do right?  I really wish justice could be brought to us but it makes me glad that someone will read this.  Maybe that witch will get fired.  Completely inappropriate and unjust.   Users/renee415

20110120 13:59:25 nbsp I wanted to live here for the longest time. These apartments are NICE. Pool, community room, and they even have some 4 bedroom units! Im not sure though if they have a washer/dryer...but if they do, youve hit the jackpot. Users/ucdsunshine

20130911 13:37:11 nbsp We were interested in living in this part of town as well as in the potential for having a washer and dryer in our apartment.  We found this lowincome apartment complex and went in to see an apartment as well as get the run down on pricing, etc.  We ended up leaving very disappointed.  The apartments are very nice, wed move in a heartbeat.  The problem was that the lowincome price for a 2bedroom was over $1200.  Then, on top of the $1200, you had to pay to rent the washer and dryer from a third party or buy your own washer and dryer and have it installed because the apartments were not equipped with the appliances, only the hookups.  If we could afford $1200+/month for an apartment we wouldnt be lowincome...  This is the same price I could pay at a nonlowincome complex. Users/JSilva

20140416 15:45:25 nbsp Been living in this complex for about a year now. Its very good price as I pay $400 for a room in a 4 bed 1.5 bath. As a word of warning the walls are a bit thin, I have the room right next to the living room and can constantly hear the TV. Its no big deal though and Id be willing to move back in. No washer and dryer in your own apartment so you do have to pay about $3 to do laundry. My experience with the management has been pleasant so far though. Users/AndrewCGreen
