20130914 16:51:19 nbsp Terry, as you know, the owner of a business does not have the final say in what the page about the business says.  The wiki is a collaborative effort to document Davis by all citizens of Davis who care to participate.  So, I understand that you have obtained a business license for the name, Fo Paws Pet Grooming.  Thats fine to say that.  But in what sense did you buy Charlenes business, Fo Paws?  Please discuss this issue with other editors here:  Fo Paws Pet Grooming/Talk  Users/CovertProfessor
