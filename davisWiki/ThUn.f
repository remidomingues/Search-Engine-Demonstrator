Background
My name is Justin Louie Lock. I am a 24 year old ChineseAmerican individual who lived in and attended UC Davis for five years. I continue to visit Davis frequently and continue to be engaged in the community as much as possible. I was known as a prominent student advocate for API and Queer issues on the UC Davis campus. My primary involvement on campus has always been with the studentrun organization, Asian & PacificIslander Queers APIQ. I have served as an officer for APIQ for the last several years since transferring into UC Davis from the community college system. I have also affiliated myself with other organizations on campus, such as SAFE, and the Queer People of Color Collective. I had the privilege of helping to plan and organize the 2009 Queer People of Color Conference at UC Davis. I consider myself an advocate for Asian and Queer people alike, especially in regards to fostering a positive societal atmosphere for my respective communities, as well as promoting healthy sexual choices and lifestyles for the LGBTQQIA community which is often plagued by negativity or stigma. Essentially I just want to promote the fact that LGBTQQIA individuals are no different from anyone else, and therefore should not be treated with prejudice or discrimination in any way, shape, or form.

20071023 22:34:46 nbsp Is Bio Brew a Sodhexo establishment, or not? Users/Graham.Freeman


20071023 23:55:05 nbsp I spent years of my life waiting for the darn building to be built, and then spending time in it.  We all knew a coffee shop was going to open inside the building (the open space and counters were obvious), and its no biggy.  I think I made the original wikipage when it was first named.   I dont care much about the whole thing, though most professors (and grad students) arent a fan of the coffee, its not that impressive :P But it gets one through the day. heh.   Users/EdWins


20071024 04:38:02 nbsp Howdy, lets start over, and let me welcome to the wiki welcome you to the wiki.  Last night was the kind of dumb confrontation that pops up now and then, and Im sorry it was your first impression here.  If you did create the WinnieLay account, please disable it (login and choose Disable this account forever in the settings menu), and hopefully everybody can remember that you are new here and simply trying to help edit the Wiki.  The edits may have gone against wiki traditions, but hell, that couldnt have been known until after they were made.  Its okay to make mistakes when youre in a new situation, and the correction could have been a bit more gentle.  Stick around, and youll get the swing of things here.  Were an open group, you just happened to accidentally trip over three major nonos... dont assume that the entry is yours if it is about you, dont delete information (even outdated info is maintained to keep a history of Davis), and dont remove criticism.  All three have subtle in this case it is okay situations, but they are the kind of things it takes awhile to figure out what the established traditions are.  Look at it this way: everybody expended all that energy last night for the exact same reason... everybody wants to improve the Bio Brew entry and improve the wiki in general.  It just takes a week or so to get how the community here works, and it is usually much less confrontational than this.  I hope you calm down (and everybody else calms down) and we can all work on the common goal of making every entry here  including Bio Brew  better.  Maybe even make some friends and enjoy ourselves doing so. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20071026 23:59:41 nbsp Hey, thats cool.  I think people just had an issue with removing the connection to Sodexho.  They want people to be aware of the corporate interest in the business, especially with the controversies related to Sodexho, (poor benefits for workers, unhealthy food).  Unfortunately, I dont think that wasnt really communicated to you in the right way.  It could have been done with a bit more respect and I thought the edit war was pretty lame.  Sorry you got the short end of the stick on that one.  To be fair, if something like that comes up again, try to keep it civil on your end too.  If you start getting a bunch of reverts, ask the editor what the problem is so you can find healthy compromise.  Fighting edit wars with edit wars just makes the problem that much more annoying.  A lot of us follow the recent changes page and nastiness can really make that list a lot less fun to read.  Theres much more effective ways to work out our differences.  That said, welcome to wiki and hope your future edits go smoother.  Users/jefftolentino

20080212 21:51:35 nbsp How about putting some information on the Sodexho page about the renaming? Users/JasonAller

20090730 04:13:01 nbsp I will fix your keyboard for some crepes. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20090730 08:40:47 nbsp Worst case, you need a new keyboard which only costs about 10 or 20 dollars. Labors cost would be small, as there is not much work invloved.  Users/RealComputers

20090730 08:44:09 nbsp If you tell me the model number I can tell you an exact price. Users/RealComputers

20090730 13:45:46 nbsp Its sometimes possible to snap the key back on, if you can line up the notches on the underside properly. Ive done this a couple times with my hp laptops before, and its usually a pretty quick fix. Users/JoePomidor

    I would asume you tried this first, but if not give it a try, they do sometimes snap back on.  Real Computers

20090730 17:57:17 nbsp a new keyboard would cost 11 dollars. They are pretty easy to repace so I would only charge you 10 dollars for labor, so the total would be 21 dollars.  Users/RealComputers

20090730 18:02:52 nbsp If you would like to go ahead with the keyboard replacement let me know and I will order the part.  Users/RealComputers

20090730 18:22:58 nbsp An H is worth 4, as there are only two of them.  Be glad that you are not missing a Q a Z (10 points each).  Super expensive if you happen to be on a triple word space at the time.  Fortunately, if you have a blank key, you can use that anywhere on the keyboard.  :) Users/IDoNotExist

    ThUn, knew that you were working at CHU for a while. I am wondering if I could call you up and talk to you for a bit regarding Sagat. Please call me 5103869088. My name is Patrick Nip. Thanks. BTW you can call me anytime.

20101007 19:22:45 nbsp Sorry to hear about the controversy.  :( Users/CovertProfessor

20101007 19:37:57 nbsp :(  :( Users/CovertProfessor

20101007 22:40:02 nbsp Eh, we both felt very strongly about our views  obviously, it was a hotbutton issue! Users/CovertProfessor

20101008 08:39:52 nbsp I try to live in the world of reason, too, although I have been known to slip from time to time.  :)  As for things being political that shouldnt be... yeah, I run into that a lot, unfortunately.  Academia is very political. Users/CovertProfessor

20101008 20:39:36 nbsp Maybe give a little time for things to cool off and see if you can talk to them again  try to explain things from your point of view.  Sounds like it couldnt hurt. Users/CovertProfessor

20101008 22:43:49 nbsp Good luck.  Hope it works. Users/CovertProfessor

20101117 09:09:14 nbsp We can definitely take out the sentence suggesting a different name for Thai Canteen.  Everyone here is an equal editor, meaning youre more than welcome to make the changes yourself. Users/TomGarberson
  Tom is right  but it was bothering me too, so I took it out myself.  Next time if you see something that needs fixing, though, please go ahead and fix!   Users/CovertProfessor
    Thank you all. :D I just wanted to discuss it before actually making any changes. I like to get approval from the community before acting on my own. Its just kind of my nature. : Users/ThUn
     Thats a good trait.  But when something is just clearly wrong, like Thai Kanteen, you should just go for it.  :)  cp

20111119 14:19:11 nbsp on the whole I would much rather interact with UCD police than DPD. Dont let one instance and one officer spoil what is generally an awesome department Users/StevenDaubert
