Thai Bistro was a Thai restaurants restaurant and Satay Bar with an excellent location on E Street Plaza. They had a pleasant outdoor patio and semielegant decor. One could expect white table cloths and mood lighting.


Often people wrote reviews about HAIR being found in the food.


Many of the dishes were quite unusual and the portions were large. Most of items were not found at any of the other Thai places in town. Not only was the food great but the service was speedy and mostly friendly. You should have tried the black sticky rice dessert. They had good deals on lunch specials which were generous in size and generally included rice and salad. The lunch food was not the same as that served for dinner. At dinner, they charged an extra $1 per person for rice, so you would have to add that to your Pizza: FSI Calculations value calculations.

Drinking water was served from a pitcher that was slightly flavored with apple and mint.

The The California Aggie Aggie voted Thai Bistro as http://www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2004/04/30/Arts/Rating.Thai.Food1317348.shtml?norewrite200605141936&sourcedomainwww.californiaaggie.com Best Thai food in Davis in 2004. They also quite frequently had coupons in the Aggie. For example, they ran at least four of them in the Aggie during October of 2005.  As you may be more inclined to order a pricier special knowing a second dish is covered, it often eneds up being a better meal for less.

20090129 03:08:49 nbsp The food is not the best, but its not bad. The food does come out somewhat slow, but overall a decent place.  Users/JasonKong

20090309 14:16:36 nbsp The dishes which are supposed to be spicy are not spicy at all. It is less authentic than the thai restaurant in Bay area. However, I still like Thai Bistro, especially for lunch. The service is a little slow.     Users/faramita

20090427 20:30:29 nbsp How does this place compare to Thai Nakorn in terms of pricing? Cheaper or more expensive? Users/ArianeMetz

20090628 09:32:22 nbsp I went here for the first time yesterday and got takeout.  I sat outside and had a couple glasses of the apple/minty water while waiting.  It is delicious  Im definitely going to try making something similar at home.  The food arrived quickly and my Pad Thai was tasty.  Im sure its not quite the same style youd get in Thailand, but then American Italian restaurants dont serve things the way they make them in Italy, same with Chinese, Mexican and so on...Americanethnic is a breed of its own.  Users/DanaSullivan

20090806 20:21:56 nbsp i like the pad thai here.  Users/Vi

20090927 20:54:20 nbsp Pad Thai is good, yo. Big portions too Users/LoooongBusRide

20091003 09:04:29 nbsp I love this place. Its my favorite Thai restaurant so far! The service is good and the food was just so delicious. I think the food here has more flavor than 2k... err, I forgot the name of the other restaurant (however 2ks service is absolutely amazing). Not to mention, the proportions are more than enough for ones stomach. Price is right for its proportions. ) Users/YLor

20091120 10:45:47 nbsp My wife and I used to really enjoy Thai Bistro until we discovered that the vegetarian curries that we had been eating for years are all made with fish sauce. The server finally told us that they can not be made vegetarian after years of specifically ordering them fishless. Im sorry to say that we will not be back. Users/ScottWeintraub

20100108 15:22:00 nbsp I went to Thai Bistro for the first time a couple of days ago, and I really enjoyed the experience. The food came out very quickly, and our water was constantly refilled. It wasnt very busy, but sometimes little things like that can get overlooked. Their Thia Iced Tea is fantastic, and the Praram Pak was a tasty vegetarian option.  Users/emmaleanne

20100116 18:19:38 nbsp Let me start off by saying I grew up in the bay area, and ate thai food just about every weekend. I was a regular at a thai place whose owners were relatively recent immigrants from thailand. I just got back from living in thailand for 6 months. I enjoy my thai food. I had an old belief that there was NO good thai food in davis, from eating at Sophias which is horrible and should not be called thai food, and 2K thai which was a hit or miss. Eating at thai bistro for the first time tonight reversed this misconception.
For a good price there is a LOT of good food to be had. I ordered pad thai, and the Pad J which is a fried eggplant dish. While I dont think I would have been able to get the eggplant dish in thailand per se, the flavors are wonderful and authentic to what seasoning should be like. It comes with a wealth of egglant and green beans, and a side of rice. And the pad thai looks like what its supposed to, not bright yellow or pink or all that nonsense its flavored well with a great amount of additional ingredients tofu, shrimp, fried egg etc really just like what I would get at a restaurant in thailand that specialized in pad thai.
I know most people think authentic?.. I dont know if that means its good. Well, it does. The food is not greasy but the noodles do not stick together, the food is wonderfully seasoned but not just salt and spice, this kind of stuff is what I look for in a thai restaurant. I will be coming here when I want thai food.

20100129 11:50:20 nbsp I like this place a lot.  The service is good and the food is excellent.  Try the green curry with chicken and prawns, it is very very good.  They also make a very good duck dish with a salty sweet dark sauce.  the patio is a nice place to sit on a beautiful day.  A very nice date restaurant, my wife and I go there often.  They have a cucumber salad apetizer that is a great price for $2. Users/DagonJones

20100203 14:31:18 nbsp I had the yellow curry and my boyfriend had a dish with noodles, chicken, and green beans (completely forgot the dish name). Im generally not a huge fan of Thai food, but the curry was amazingly good and for a great price (eating the leftovers as I type this!). The only downside was that the potato chunks were a bit undercooked, but otherwise it was delicious. Dinner for the both of us was around $22, pretty good deal. This will definitely be the place I go to from now on when Im in the mood for Thai curry. Users/AliceW

20100211 18:43:39 nbsp I really like Thai Bistro. The food is delicious, and the restaurant feels upscale while not being very pricey. The servers are really friendly, and the outside patio is really nice when the weathers good. Users/bear

20100422 15:18:04 nbsp Delicious food!! I highly recommend this place. I really like the lunch specials here; Ive never been here for dinner.
For lunch, the food portions are huge and the food is quite tasty!
The thai iced teas are great and the service is excellent.  Users/areli00

20100603 16:59:25 nbsp my fav thai spot! the boyfriend and i came here last year and we loved it. the housemate and i came here couple months back and the same. LOVE IT! so good! get the duck something. i love that one Users/Hollen

20100603 20:07:55 nbsp Really big takeout portions and good food. Users/strawberry

20100701 22:23:41 nbsp Tonight was my first time at Thai Bistro, I was craving for Thai food and was disappointed. The waitress forgot about us and we waited really long for our food. the Chicken curry and the pad thai was too sweet. the papaya salad is too americanized, i wanted authentic papaya salad, not papaya in lime juice. the thai fried rice was a bit wet but it was good.  Users/walkingtoclass

20100707 14:06:28 nbsp I think I commented on Thai Bistro sometime in the past, but its been awhile, so time for a refresher anyway.  Weve fallen into a Thai Nakorn rut, so I tend to forget about Thai Bistro.  But with Thai Nakorn on an extended summer holiday, we were motivated to come back and remember how pleasant it can be to sit out on the Bistros patio when a breeze is blowing and there are no incompetent buskers about.  This time I was particularly taken with the Panang Nuer, which was very different from other panangs Ive had (more stewlike) and ohsoflavorful.  It wasnt hot (for you heat fanatics out there), but we didnt ask for hot.  Service was prompt and friendly, as weve always experienced here.  I think well just have to suck it up and eat Thai food more often so that we can frequent both Bistro and Nakorn.  One caveat: We noticed a sign applying for a change in ownership.  Im not sure if that has already occurred yet or not.  More reason to check back again.  :) Users/CovertProfessor

20100718 13:04:24 nbsp when we came a couple months ago the food was good, but one chick was handling the whole floor and looked pretty harried. Things kinda lagged but the food was good! If cp was right then new ownership will probably shake things up Users/StevenDaubert

20101021 20:54:46 nbsp If you want flavor, avoid this place. We ordered it extra spicy, and it was the most bland Thai food weve ever tasted. Users/jsg718

20110617 15:52:20 nbsp This is my favorite Thai restaurant. Anywhere. Davis seems to have a disproportionately large number of Thai restaurants so you probably have to be doing something right to survive. Theyre doing a lot right. When youre standing at the counter you can watch the kitchen and they always seem to be chopping up some fresh produce. You can see why in the picture of Yum Duck above. It seems pretty standard for their non curry dishes to feature a colorful array of fruits and veggies in an acidic dressing, served with whatever meat you chose. Its a safe place to get seafood and their GOONG SCALLOP KATIEM is particularly good. My favorite item here is the lamb kabob. Its the tenderest, juiciest lamb Ive ever had and I love the two sauces it comes with. I dont normally like lamb, but when I do, I really like it.  Users/MikeyCrews

20110618 13:51:33 nbsp This has been my favorite place in Davis for Thai food since I moved here in 2006, but I dont think Ill be able to return after today.  The food itself is tasty, the servers are friendly; it was the following experience that has taken this restaurant off my list.

The first negative was when my friend found a hair in her green curry. But we all agreed, hey, that happens.  Then, during the same meal, my other friend found a piece of plastic in her mango chicken.  Both of those things were forgivable (disregarding that they happened simultaneously, on a very slow evening).  The final straw was today, when I heated up my leftovers: halfway through, I found an INSECT PART, probably the leg of a roach.

Needless to say, thats just unacceptable.  I wont be going to Thai Bistro anymore. Users/LauraGYoung
  I think this place is good enough that I could tolerate up to 1/3 of a cockroach. Users/MikeyCrews

20110719 13:41:42 nbsp Ate there for lunch and got yellow curry. Halfway through my meal, I find a LARGE HAIR. I showed the waitress and she did nothing about it, I told her I had a hard time paying for my lunch that I didnt get to finish and my friend didnt finish hers all well after seeing the GROSS HAIR, she has lost her appetite. She said hair happens, you have hair, I have hair, hair happens. Yes but hair doesnt need to be happening in my food. Her hair was not tied up or even in a hair net. Looking on this site and yelp I have now found 5 posting about hair in food here. Dont go here unless you like Hairy Thai Food! Users/SharesHope

20120214 14:42:46 nbsp Pad Kee Mow with beef is good here.  My friends and I used to love this place until it changed ownership and we noticed food tasted bland.  Recently, my friends and I tried it again and to our surprise, it actually tasted good again.  Its too bad they went through a low period, I think it pushed a lot of loyal customers away to the many other Thai restaurants in town.   Users/BingL

20120317 15:52:49 nbsp This place has gone downhill with the new ownership. I had lunch with a friend today and found the service and food lacking. The cook seemed overwhelmed and took almost 45 minutes to prepare our food. Our server was an older white gentleman who was nice but inexperienced. The water in my pot of green tea was lukewarm, and he forgot the Thai iced tea that my friend ordered. It was the cook who noticed that we had run out of water and refilled our glasses. The restroom was clean, though the toilet lid had a large crack that was only partially covered by a cloth. Looked a little tacky.  Users/nowhereman

20120427 07:08:35 nbsp Unfortunately it looks like they have closed for good. A sign is in the window announcing that an Indian/Nepalese restaurant is replacing it. Users/ScottWong
  Oh, that would be very sad.   Users/CovertProfessor
