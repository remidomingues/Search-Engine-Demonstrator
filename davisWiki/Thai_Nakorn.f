Thai Nakorn is a welcome addition to Davis Davis already good choices in Thai restaurants. It seems almost always full at night time night. Once you get in the door the wait doesnt stop there, for many claim that the service tends to be painfully slow, especially if you are really hungry! Lunch Specials Lunch hours are less busy. Favorite vegetarian options vegetarian dishes include vegetable Tom Yum and eggplant with tofu. A carnivore friend is very fond of the duck curry. Those who actually like eggplant should taste the Eggplant Special (best with pork if meat is desired).  Great place to eat before hitting Regal Cinemas Davis Stadium 5 for a show.

Thai Nakorn allows takeout and does catering.  Lunch specials start at $7.45.  During warm weather, there is lovely outdoor seating in the Plant Plaza.

Planning a big dinner party and bringing your own wine?  Thats fine; however, there is a $6.00 corkage fee per bottle, so factor that into your budget!

20100122 13:21:51 nbsp I just came from lunch there. Both my friend and I found hair (not ours) in our food. After I complained to the waiter, the owner came out and insisted we could not have possibly found hair in our food, not in her restaurant! And yet, there it was.  Users/mnightingale

20100122 13:38:00 nbsp I went to Thai Nakorn with three friends today. The soup that came before our meal looked great, filled with vegetables. And it tasted OK. We were disturbed when one of our party pulled a hair that clearly belonged to the server out of the soup. He threw it on the floor and we decided one hair, no big deal. Then another of us found a hair in our meal. When the girl who filled waters eventually came around to fill our long empty glasses, we mentioned the hairs to her. We also asked for our thai iced coffee refill (says refill on menu).

A woman came storming over looking angry to our table. What is this about hair. We explain...There was no hair in your food. You make it up. It is impossible they wear hair nets. You are wrong. Where are these hairs. Um, OK, we arent asking for free food, were telling you there WAS hair and if we found two, others will find it. And we threw the hair on the floor. She bellows well, what do you want from me. What do you want me to do in a very rude and angry voice and then walked away. The she comes back later with a full pitcher of thai iced coffee and proceeds to refill our glasses exactly 1/3 full. Menu should say partial cheapass refill. And thats my story.

  You cant seriously expect stellar service from some who (maybe wrongfully) is angry with you. I went there recently with a few friends and was surprised at the generous refills they give. (we had quite a few Thai coffee/teas) Users/TusharRawat  TR

20100122 13:56:05 nbsp bfaiathd and mnightingale  I assume you two were from the same party?  Just curious, since thatd be a heck of a bad day for Nakorn if there were two similar incidents. Users/TomGarberson

20100226 23:08:46 nbsp I have now tried eggplant dishes at Thai Recipes, Thai Bistro, and Thai Nakorn, and while all three are quite good, I have to say that Thai Nakorn does the best job. I am looking forward to comparing other dishes. Users/Kyonghwa

20100424 18:33:03 nbsp Just had their Roast Duck curry with my family  YUM.  It was delicious and even though I was full almost halfway through eating it, I couldnt stop. Users/OliviaY

20100604 21:43:05 nbsp Went to Thai Nakorn today and we were amazed by the friendly service!!  we ordered the Spicy Chicken Wings.  at first i was skeptical because they give you six wings for 6.95, but after the nice lady talked me into it, boy was i happy! we also got the Pad Thai, and the pineapple fried rice.  the pineapple fried rice was the bomb.  overall one of my favorite places to get thai food in davis.  BTW the thai iced tea is really good too.  i wish they would have some lettuce wraps or spring rolls on their menu though... Users/dookies

20100614 01:48:38 nbsp I went there at about 7 PM today and the service took a very long time. They were busy, most of the tables were full, but they should have more cooking staff if this is common. Curry comes in a pretty small serving for how expensive it isI cant eat much in one sitting so this is fine for me, but I usually like to take it home to eat latter.

On the plus side, they give free refills of Thai tea, and the food is decent, if not spectacular. The red curry I had tasted a bit off (a bit too sweet?) but thats probably a matter of preference. I dont recall them actually charging for the tea; if that was intentional, it was very kind of them. I drank quite a bit.Users/sundeimasu

Include(Sockpuppet)20100616 16:33:47 nbsp Thai Nakorn is an amazing place to dine in. The atmosphere is pleasant and the service is also decent. The food is amazing and Im loving the free thai ice tea refills. I ate here for lunch and had a very tasty pad thai~ It was well seasoned and the pork with it was delish~ Definitely coming back here again!  Users/Carry

Include(Sockpuppet)20100616 17:05:04 nbsp I had a great time eating here during my graduation. I have been eating here all of the time throughout my time in college and decided to bring my family to come over and eat too. I like the pad thai, roasted duck curry, and pad kee mow very much. These dishes are delicious. For lunch, their specials are of reasonable prices.   Users/Jiahui

20100616 20:27:20 nbsp I was here for my graduation dinner as well...and love love love the roast duck curry.  The silver noodle salad made for a great appetizer for our guests and they were very kind about letting me bring in my own cheesecake for dessert. Users/OliviaY

20100616 20:51:49 nbsp Wow, how is it that I have never commented on my experiences with this restaurant?  I love Thai Nakorn.  It is my favorite Thai restaurant in Davis  and that is saying something, given that are are now... what  7?  8?  (losing count) Thai restaurants here.  The curries are rich and flavorful, veggie dishes come with lots of good fresh vegetables, and the menu has a wide assortment of yummy dishes and appetizers (try the mango curry... yum).  We always get prompt and extremely friendly service here, not to mention, they have a dogs dog friendly outdoor patio.  Definitely recommended. Users/CovertProfessor

20100815 01:30:40 nbsp The food is great, I always get the duck curry, and you can get extra rice with that too, making the proportions very generous. The people there are very friendly, and I would say this is the best Thai restaurant in Davis in terms of the portions for the cost, and the quality of the food. Users/PeterWang

20100827 06:10:14 nbsp I think this place has the best pad thai in town. Users/NorCalFoodLover

20100827 16:22:57 nbsp This is my favorite Thai place in Davis; I go there (or get takeout) probably once a month or so.  But last time I was a little disappointed: the green papaya salad was rather lacking in hotness.  But free refills on Thai iced coffee?  That rocks. Users/DanLawyer

20110405 21:48:05 nbsp Good food, good service.  Would recommend the salmon dish (chu chee?  cant remember the name exactly) and especially the yellow curry, though not if youre a fan of spicy food as theyre both pretty mild.  Thai iced tea was not quite as good as some other places but they do give free refills.  Overall good experience. Users/cmwhit

20110413 13:00:22 nbsp this is the best thai place in town! i keep coming back for more and more Users/anonymousaggie

20110426 16:26:58 nbsp Best thai in town.  I always take my sister here when she comes to visit me in Davis. Yummmm nom nom nom.  Staff is great too, super great service, fast, friendly, clean.     Users/NikiRose

20110908 09:13:10 nbsp Great food, great staff... warm and professional.  My personal favorite is the Fresh Ginger with chicken... very fresh, and not too many @#$% mushrooms.  The chicken satay is also pretty good here. Users/OldDavis73

20110908 10:38:01 nbsp This is by far my favorite Thai restaurant in Davis.  The food is always good and the service is great.  The owners are so nice and make it such a welcoming place.  Best duck curry around, hands down. Users/Aaron.Curtin

20111216 16:50:38 nbsp good food, will go back again. Users/JeffA

20120106 11:45:53 nbsp This is the best Thai place in town hands down. I love everything about this place. The food is always fresh and delicious! Oh I have not had lunch yet. I am on my way! Users/ashleyinthemist

20120112 12:50:36 nbsp I have been to Thai Nakorn several times and they definitely have the best Thai food in town. Service has also been excellent and I will keep coming back!  Users/DrS

20120115 13:39:39 nbsp We got the Roast Duck Curry last night because it had the most positive reviews on the wiki. It had a lot of duck skin. I dont like eating duck skin or any animal skin for that matter. I filled up a Chevys salsa dish with unwanted duck skin. The curry itself and the duck meat were pretty tasty though. Users/MikeyCrews

20120305 23:09:15 nbsp This place is one of our favorite Thai food restaurants. We go here all the time for their pumpkin curry, but I get it with chicken instead of prawns, and this makes it a little cheaper too.  Soooooo Good! We also love their Tom Kah Gai soup! Yummy! Their Thai Iced Teas are also delish, with free refills. :D Users/EmilyHarris

20120322 10:33:20 nbsp The Good:
Good Food (Flavorful, Good Portion for amount charged, Bottomless Thai Tea)
Good Atmosphere: Tastefully done
Good Service:
Clean Restroom!
They dont charge for extra rice. (Anyone that does otherwise should be a crime)
easy to find parking (Parking garage nearby)

The Bad:
Place is a bit small when the place reach capacity.
Food should be brought in together.
Closes a bit early.
You have to go outside for the bathroom

Overall: Like it, would recommend it. Go try it!

20120323 10:53:51 nbsp I love Nakorn, its not just our favorite Thai restaurant, its our favorite restaurant altogether. Were hooked to the food, especially the duck curry and the eggplant dishes. Now that they offer free refills on Thai ice tea, its a bonus. And to top it all off, the boss and the servers are just lovely! Users/NicoleR

20120424 20:21:39 nbsp I finally got a chance to check out this place Picnic Day with a rather large group (while rocking sweet dinosaur hats from the geology department!) We got our food in a prompt and courteous manner save for one dish that took a bit longer to come. Ordered the Pad Thai (hey, it was three in the afternoon and I hadnt eaten anything ALL DAY) and found it somewhat pricey but delicious. Rest of group quite enjoyed food and multiple Thai teas; glasses were filled quickly and often before they were empty. Dishes were a bit too pricey for my liking ($9.75 for Pad Thai?) but I wouldnt say no to another visit.  Users/HarrisonM

20120621 22:28:40 nbsp Out of the hundreds of Thai restaurants that overwhelm Davis (why are there so many and yet not one decent Dim Sum restaurant??) Thai Nakorn is my favorite. The pad thai with tofu and the broccoli delight with your choice of meat are the only things I get and love. Im not one to step out of my comfort zone so once I like a dish Ill continue ordering the same thing at a restaurant. Service has always been nice so nothing to complain about! Go for their lunch specials, its decently priced.   Users/Jujubean

20120702 17:29:35 nbsp This is my favorite of the Thai restaurants in Davis.  Ive been there probably 30 times in the last 10 years.  Great food, delightful service and a nice atmosphere.  It is just like being in Thailand, except the air is not a yellowish broth of humidity and exhaust fumes... Users/sys$hobbit

20120812 14:23:49 nbsp Its too bad their dishes are too expensive for me otherwise I would eat here more often. I love their duck curry. Amazing stuff.  Users/OliviaGlass

20130312 10:05:39 nbsp I come here quite often, averaging 12 times a week for lunch. Around 12:00pm this place fills up rather quickly. They often have larger parties for lunch, so if you can come earlier at 11:30am you will most likely avoid crowds and slow serving time.
The food: I highly recommend the Hot Basil with beef lunch special. The flavor is fantastic, portion is huge, and since Ive cut out carbs I requested extra lettuce to which they obliged with no hassle. The quality is consistent, I can always expect it to taste great. Ive ordered padthai, duck noodle soup, pineapple fried rice, curry, calamari, and eggplant stir fry before. I gotta say the dishes are all above average (flavorful and consistent, no hitormiss).  Users/JessicaYang


20140712 19:05:54 nbsp I really do like this place, but their prices are so high. I normally get the Tom Kha...it is the best Tom Kha Ive ever had but its always been steep at $10 a bowl, with a small side of rice. I called today to order it and was told that the small portion of rice would now be $1.25. The soup itself is not filling enough to justify $10 on its own, and almost $12 for a bowl of soup for lunch is just a little ridiculous. I probably wont be going back much, which is a shame because Ive yet to find Tom Kha that is as good. I guess Ill start looking again.

The rest of their food is hit or miss I like the pineapple fried rice a lot. The pad seew was ok one time I got it and very flavorless the next time. My coworker got some duck noodle soup for lunch about a week ago. It was also in the $1012 range and he said it was so bad he couldnt finish it. Users/KianaFreitas
