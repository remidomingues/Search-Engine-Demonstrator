20080817 13:46:58 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy Thanh... just like everything else in human society, theres not much freshman into to the wiki because nobody is doing it yet.  If youd like to help spread the word, there are wiki fliers, stickers and such available.  Also, theres been some Farmers Market tabling, and it would probably be a good idea to get some fellow volunteers and do a few days worth of tabling now that classes are in.

20091013 14:17:26 nbsp Hi Thanh Users/ThUn


20091223 02:28:56 nbsp What you posted was irrelevant to the page you posted on and your complaints about claims made on wikipedia are irrelevant on this wiki.

What does the UCSA have to do with the size of the ASUCD budget?
Why should we care about the mistakes in wikipedia? We didnt write any of that stuff. Users/WilliamLewis

20100206 14:33:25 nbsp Hey, I restored the joke on the Toad Tunnels entry because I thought you might be unaware that humor is common and encouraged on the Davis Wiki.  Some people confuse wikis with Wikipedia, and assume they are somehow connected (they arent, any more than Twitter is connected to Davis Wiki).  Wikipedia editors might be a bunch of humorless toadlickers, but the Davis Wiki is a community website, and a part of being a community is having some levity in the mix.  On the other hand, maybe you just didnt find it funny, in which case I apologize for assuming you were just removing it because you thought it shouldnt be there.  I couldnt tell because you didnt leave a reason for your removal edit, so I figured Id let you know the reason for my revert. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20100206 14:39:26 nbsp Are you involved with ASUCD? What do you think about the proposal to annex the MUGA? Users/StevenDaubert
