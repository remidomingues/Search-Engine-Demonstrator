All I know is, this Users/JabberWokky Jabberwokky character comes out of thin air in the middle of a goddamn alley while his buddies are flying around on wires cutting everybody to shreds, and he just stands there waiting for me to drive my truck straight through him with light coming out of his mouth! << That, my friends, is the Davis Wiki, in one sentence. ;)

Favorite quote ever from a wiki editor: He was unkempt and lacking in basic social skills, Im guessing that he is probably a grad student in some asinine field of study.

Deepest truth on the wiki: It is generally considered unwise to inquire into a grad students research: either its not going well, in which case the grad student will probably try to hurt you for reminding him or her of it; or its going well, in which case youll be treated to a rambling and impenetrable lecture on Furrier Transformers or something.
