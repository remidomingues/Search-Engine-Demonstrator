Right. Community spirit?

I was riding down Sycamore one sunny day, and some friendly people were standing on the other side of the road.

They waved me across, looking very desperate.

It turns out they wanted me to take a picture for them.

I was relieved it wasnt more serious and was glad to oblige.

They offered me some cake, which I politely declined.

Just pay it forward.

There is an incredible amount of selfish and petty people in this world. Its the small things that count.
