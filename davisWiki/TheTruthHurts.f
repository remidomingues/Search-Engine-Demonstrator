20100714 14:39:53 nbsp Hello and welcome to the Wiki. If a representative of a business comes onto the Wiki and tries to delete comments from a page with a reason, a Wiki Gnome will usually be quick to fix that. If you want your comments to have more weight, consider establishing an identity or using your importance of using your realname real name. Users/hankim

20100714 15:11:01 nbsp If youre going to insinuate that our community http://daviswiki.org/Users/JabberWokky?actiondiff&version21694&version11693 takes kickbacks for removing critical posts, kindly fuck off and die. We try our best to represent all the opinions in the community on this website and dont take kindly to people trying to silence others. On the other hand we have a problem with people coming on here and trashing things with ulterior motives. Asking people to use their real names helps insure that this doesnt happen.

How serious are we about defending stuff and not letting businesses bully criticism off here? Ive been stalked and been threatened with lawsuits because I wouldnt let businesses delete criticism they demanded be removed.

You have no idea whats going on here, but I guess whatever you say is the truth and it apparently hurts. Not. But, after your ignorant, anonymous insinuations on here, Im really not ready to believe anything you say at this point. Users/WilliamLewis

20100714 15:18:49 nbsp Hey man, if you want your negative business reviews to stay on the Wiki, just PayPal me fifty bucks and I will make sure it stays. You gotta pay to play here. Didnt you read the welcome to the wiki rules of engagement here? Users/hankim

20100714 15:31:40 nbsp Heres a tip about anonymous accounts with no identity to back them up: you only need one per household. As a oneoff account (read: valueless), theres no reason to have more than one per computer. If you really feel like standing behind your words with your real name, then by all means, have a different account for each person. When we see multiple anonymous accounts with the same IP, though, they will almost certainly get deleted for sockpuppeting. Users/JoePomidor

20100714 15:33:15 nbsp So, let me get this straight here:  in order to back up your accusation of foul play by one group, you are now making an accusation that I know personally to be false?   You are attempting to establish credibility by throwing around outlandish accusations of serious criminal activityFootnote(Were a registered nonprofit, so your allegations would violate federal law.)?  Really? Really? Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, (814) 8898845

20100714 15:36:48 nbsp I speak truth, 100% absolute fact based on logic & critical reasoning as well as personal experience. If you can not fathom, grasp, or accept what is really happening or what you are seeing maybe you should join the rest of them and just eat.sleep.consume. while the reat of us continue to read between the lines. Users/TheTruthHurts

20100714 15:36:51 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki, Truth.  Way to get people riled up... zero to pissed in two seconds flat!  Heres an idea, though.  Rather than throwing around ridiculous accusations, why not look around a little and see if theres any hint of a basis, anywhere, for them. Users/TomGarberson

20100714 15:39:03 nbsp i like hankim sense of humor lol Users/TheTruthHurts

20100714 15:39:39 nbsp http://daviswiki.org/Users/TheTruthHurts?actiondiff&version217&version116 Really? No, youre full of shit and about as valuable.  Users/WilliamLewis

20100714 15:40:08 nbsp @ joepomidor yeah i didnt think of the same Ip adress deal, it makes sense I used to delete posts from my ffxi ls forums for same reason Users/TheTruthHurts

20100714 15:41:47 nbsp actually i was under the assumption that the businesses managment itself was deleting posts, because that is just how they roll around here and I thought you probably worked for the comapny or were an affiliate Users/TheTruthHurts
  Ahh, theres the 100% absolute fact! Users/TomGarberson
  Im the one who removed them.  Its probably not a good idea to claim to speak 100% absolute fact before you can read the (completely open and visible to anybody) edit history.  No worries, but this isnt a forum, its a community wiki.  Different dynamics, different traditions.  No real rules (as Han points out, you might want to welcome to the wiki read this to get an idea of how things work).  Everything is easily reverted (theres a perpetual undo history), so theres lots of editing back and forth and working things out.  Its pretty common for people to trip up early on, assuming this is like some kind of internet site rather than a site populated by neighbors all working together, equally empowered to edit.

20100714 15:57:20 nbsp where did all the fun hateful comments by some of your loose cannons go? didnt mean to piss off some of your youn guns but it was kinda funny to read, thanks to some of you that actually responded w/ logic as opposed to cursing me out, would hate to run into one of your aggresive guys at woodstocks while i am having pizza, good thing I didnt use my real name that william guy might track me down and kick my ass lol.  nvm theyre still here for me to have a lol @ next time I post about a buisness thanks :) Users/TheTruthHurts
   You mean some of our loose cannons  youre an equal part of the community now, and you have to deal with William just as the rest of us do.  ;)   There are no moderators of content... youre equally as empowered as anybody else when it comes to whats on the wiki (I told you it was different than forums).  So, just like in real life, you have to deal with people who are a bit hot headed.  Its part of being in a community of real people. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, (814) 8898845

20100714 17:23:38 nbsp word (.)b Users/TheTruthHurts

20100714 19:46:28 nbsp Regarding your comment to Users/hankim: Its not really about name, its about identity.  People like Users/CovertProfessor have a stated reason to be anonymous; its the aggressively I dont want to be responsible for my actions or Im lying to pretend to be multiple people type of anonymity that raises a problem.  Whistleblowers are cool.  Masked vandals less so.  A business manager pretending to be lots of people leaving positive reviews for themselves or negative reviews for their competitors is really bad.  Its just one of those problems without a really good solution other than poking at every case to see whats under the rock.  Pretty much everything on the wiki is common sense when you understand the background  and the wiki is full of people willing to help you out if you want.  (And if you come up with a better solution, do it!) Users/JabberWokky

20101214 18:54:17 nbsp TruthI checked the pages of Sharps & Flats and Tanglewood and I see no current evidence that editing of complaints has occured. If you see any and want to point them out, you have my personal word it will be addressed. Users/PeterBoulay
