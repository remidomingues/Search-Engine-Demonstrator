The KDVS Is My Life House has been throwing parties and occasional shows since November of 2004. However, its name or personality did not fully materialize until Brendan Boyle, Steven Valentino and Melissa Kenney (three KDVS corestaffers) moved in with Andy on September 1st 2005. Since then, there have been several dance parties, shows and the like. However, the house is most known as a dance party house. Excellent relations with tolerant and considerate neighbors, some of which attend have resulted in a lack of police awareness of events. Having harassed the house twice (one year apart), the KDVS Is My Life house has yet to receive a citation. In fact, their parties are known for going strong with the KDVS Mobile DJ Unit past 3 a.m. and having eclectic, danceable, LOUD music and even disco balls, strobe lights, lasers and a fog machine. A few police have parked across the street from the house, though, and have threatened noise violations as of late (2006).
