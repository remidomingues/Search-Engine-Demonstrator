The 230  The 230 is the group of awesome girls living in Apt 230 at Greystone during the 20052006 year. We have two cats, Dante and Frankie that seem to reside here for some reason, and our Official Apartment Mascot is Yoma.

Users/RohiniJasavala Ro, Users/SamanthaWagner Sam, Users/AmiraSamaha Amira and Meike all live here.

Phone Number: 1900FuckYourMother

Things We Do: We like to listen to Dane Cook, Yell the words TWAT and HOBAG, and own things, like Picnic Day.  We also try to watch lots of movies, and annoy the cats as much as possible.


We love the cats...and pets love back.
