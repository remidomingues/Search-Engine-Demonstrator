The A Factor is an independent tutoring service for physical sciences and engineering at UC Davis. Courses offered include introductory Calculus, Chemistry, Physics, as well as select upper division Engineering and Chemistry Courses.

MISSION
The A Factors mission is to turn lost, procrastinating, or struggling students into motivated and productive independent thinkers through continuous reinforcement and constructive application of knowledge and ability. Primary goals include finishing homework, developing good study habits and work ethic, and receiving As on exams. We want to not only help you finish your homework or ace an exam but build the skills that will benefit you in the long run.

TEACHING 
At The A Factor, we believe that tutoring should not consist of just random help, but organization. There will be concise, to the point lectures in areas where you struggle with most, followed by interactive problem solving sessions, so you never get bored by doing the same thing over and over again. The A Factors extensive library of condensed notes will ensure you have the smoothest  and quickest learning experience imaginable.
