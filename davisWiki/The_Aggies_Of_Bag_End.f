The Aggies of Bag End is an official UC Davis Student Organization. We are a social group to inform the campus of the scifi culture: Middle Earth.

Our mission is threefold: first, to inform students about the works of J.R.R Tolkien in order to encourage them to explore the world of Middle Earth and other scifi cultures; secondly, to encourage students to develop their reading capabilities by reading some of Tolkiens complex works such as The Lord of the Rings Series and The Similarion; and lastly, to help students better understand Tolkiens works by organizing movie marathons, debates and book discussions.

A few things to look forward to are:

  Movie marathons
  Book discussions
  Movie discussions
  LOTR hangout days
  Hobbit Premiere
  LOTR/Hobbit Baking
  LOTR/Hobbit Video games nights
  Traveling to Middle Earth (aka actually raising money to go to New Zealand through STA Travel)
