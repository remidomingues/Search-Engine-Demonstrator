Nothing is known about the Art Building Mushroom yet, though investigation is underway. In the meantime, ogle the photos or better yet, take a field trip to see this big fungus from family agaricaceae . Its hidden under some trees that grow just outside the west entrance of the building.

Theres another (probably unrelated) fake mushroom outside of the LGBTRC (2006).

As of 2011 neither mushrooms are there.
