The Arterys 21st annual California Clay Competition runs April 30May 28.  On exhibit are over 40 ceramic pieces of art representing some of Californias finest talent.

The Artery is an artist cooperatives cooperative founded in 1975, making it one of the oldest and longest operating Davis art galleries art institutions. (30 art gallery years is about 120 human years...)  It is owned and operated by the artists whose art work is displayed.

This gallery features work in many media, including jewelry, ceramics, textiles, wood, metal sculpture, fine art paintings, blown glass, clay & stone sculpture and unique and high quality contemporary crafts created by 65 member/artists.  Open 7 days a week, its a great place to find that perfect gift. Reasonable price range. Art Exhibits in the gallery change monthly.  Opening night receptions take place every 2nd Friday of the month. The quality is quite high, so when you need a gift (yes, they wrap), the Artery should be first on your list.  Its a great place to meet up with friends and spend a few casual minutes to get an artinfusion and interact with the artists.

They also sponsor the 2nd Friday ArtAbout gallery walks. Also visit John Natsoulas Art Gallery or Pence Gallery for fine art.

History of the Location
Along with the neighboring spot, Davis Barber Shop 209 G Street, the location was formerly occupied by a twostory hotel until about 1950.  For decades it was called Hunt Hotel but its name before closing down was Etna Hotel.  Soon after the closure, Star Pharmacy took over the south side of the twostory building.  The Artery now exists in roughly the same location as where Star Pharmacy once stood.
