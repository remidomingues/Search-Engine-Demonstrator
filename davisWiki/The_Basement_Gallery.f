In the tradition of hiding things in basements, the Art Department decided to stash an Art Galleries art gallery in the basement of the Art Building. It is a student run gallery that accepts submissions from anyone, whether or not they are an art major. For more information on exhibits and submitting work, go to the art building and read the flyers, or email the Basement Gallery directors at student.art.gallery@gmail.com. If you would like to receive emails regarding shows and submitting work to them, there is a signup sheet for the mailing list on the wall outside of the gallery.

Their mission statement reads, The Basement Gallery is a studentrun, studentorganized art gallery located on the UC Davis campus. Our mission as gallery directors is to create an exciting art space of sophisticated and professional art shows that appeal to diverse crowds and that highlight the quality work being made by students. By doing this, we hope to establish the Basement Gallery as a vital alternative space for seeing important new work and for experiencing interesting and innovative art shows.

20050127 18:50:40 nbsp I think that this should be called The Basement Gallery because thats what its called. the article distingushes it from other basement galleries. its not just a basement gallery, its The Basement Gallery. Users/ArlenAbraham

20050128 15:08:55 nbsp Are there other basement galleries?  I think its more appropriate to leave articles out of page names, such as in the case of the Arboretum.  And wherever there is ambiguity, its much better to add descriptive words to the page name rather than an article.  Calling the page The Basement Gallery doesnt really resolve the problem of having multiple basement galleries.  Perhaps Art Department Gallery or something along those lines would be more appropriate if there are truly several basement galleries. Users/MikeIvanov

20130101 17:52:32 nbsp Does anyone know what the art building hours for the art studios are? It used to be that the building would be open for art students to work in the studios from 7am to 7pm daily, including holidays and weekends, but I have noticed that it seems to always be locked now. Is there any dependable way to know when its possible to access the studios to work on projects? Users/quarabaloosa
