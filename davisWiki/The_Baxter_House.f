Not much is known about the Baxter House. Its located out by the Airport and you have to take Hutchison Drive Hutchison to get to its former location (by the north end of the runway). Its a pretty creepy place at night.

The Baxter House was named one of the http://media.www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2006/09/28/Muse/TheSeven.Wonders.Of.Davis2314186page2.shtml?sourcedomainwww.californiaaggie.com&MIIHostmedia.collegepublisher.com Seven Wonders of Davis by the California Aggie in 2006.

Anyways, a google search doesnt turn up anything besides an http://www.obitcentral.com/obitsearch/obits/ca/cayolo6.htm obituary of a Naomi Baxter who was married to a Maurice Baxter:

  He then worked for the university and the family lived in a house at the University Airport, which has recently been designated the Baxter House. In April 1965, they moved into town and Maurice retired from the university in 1968.

After the Baxters died, the house was used as an avian research facility called the Michael Fry research facilityone of several other buildings in the vicinity of the University Airport that were also used for avian research. Michael Fry resigned from his position in UC Davis in 2002, moved to Colorado for another scientist job and currently resides in Washington, DC.

On Saturday, July 9th, 2005, the Playboy Millionaires, The Naders, Some Assholes, and Unless attempted to play a show at The Baxter House but the UC Davis Police Department cops came after three minutes of music. The initial legal authority figure was the Campus Safety Escort Service UC Davis Escort Service which leads someone to speculate if someone asked the escort service to take them there. THAT, was stupid upon their part.

The Baxter House was burnt down as part of a UC Davis Fire Department training exercise on June 30, 2009.  The site is now a part of the HÃ¤agenDazs Honey Bee Haven, a garden donated to UC Davis which will officially open to the public sometime in spring 2010.

20050621 18:40:57 nbsp I passed by the house one night last year with some friends.  I cant quite remember all the details, but I believe I heard a faint voice from the house which freaked us out. Users/StevenWong

20050623 01:05:25 nbsp  the commentary on the writing on the blackboard left out the biggest thing  the DIE written in huge letters.. maybe because its so big one can miss it? Users/KrisFricke
  I didnt notice it before. But it also has the flash reflection on it, and it looked more like random eraser marks than intentional writing. Good eye. Users/MichelleAccurso

20050626 13:27:16 nbsp We went there last night.  Careful, there are black widows lurking in the corners.  We explored a bit, saw a box labeled stewart in the garage and found some porn in the crawlspace beneath the house.  With the right music, could be really creepy. Users/AndreaStewart
  haha awesome.  how old was the porn? Users/KrisFricke

20050626 23:49:31 nbsp This place looks like some sort of freaky exscience lab with the equipment removed.  I wonder if you play the tape will you hear powersaws and people screaming? And then the data readouts on the paper, the oldschool chalkboard... Who needs that many power outlets in their home?  Users/KarlMogel

20050627 00:04:08 nbsp Who has a bathroom sink like taht?  Probably was originally a house, then converted to a death lab of some sort? Users/GeorgeLewis

20050627 00:12:35 nbsp The tape player looks like an old school data recorder to me. The house was probably someones residence at some point, and then later became an avian research lab of sorts. OOOOO haunted avian research lab.  One could always ask http://www.ucdavis.edu/search/directory_results.shtml?id00017323 Denise Chakerian what they did there. (see permit)  Those pegs above the sink are what you have in labs to dry flasks, beakers, etc. Users/ArlenAbraham

20050714 16:16:10 nbsp Id like to know why this house was branded the label of haunted.  Could someone please offer me some reasonable explanations?  Otherwise it just seems like a fluffed up rumor. Users/BrianChen
  I thought haunted was just used as an adjective, as it seems to suffer from the symptions of haunted houses. I dont think its a rumor because ghosts dont exist. :p Users/JesseSingh

  Traditionally, hauntings usually only occur in places where violent deaths or strong emotions were experienced...and animals are generally rare as ghosts, although allegedly the Tower of London is haunted by a ghostly bear and, of all things, a ghostly test tube (im serious). Other than being an abandoned house, nothing seems really spooky about its past... Users/MatthewTom

20051031 09:15:56 nbsp The place is haunted by decapitated Doublecrested Cormorant hatchlings that want their livers back Users/BradBenedict

20051111 22:19:30 nbsp what the hell we tried to go there but all the doors where boarded up and there was a message that said no tresspassing. if you do, you will regret it. UCD Police or something like that Users/TaylorClark

20060208 13:59:20 nbsp I went there last night. It was horribly creepy, we couldnt get in because the place was boarded up with bars over the windows. We almost went through the crawl space... while we were standing outside we heard awful screams in the distance, like some kind of animal trapped in a nearby laboratory. All in all it was pretty damn creepy. Users/LeahGanis

20060219 18:51:35 nbsp I dont think the note on the door is really from the UCD Police Dept  Cops write everything in UPPERCASE. Its all boarded up, every window and door. The front door is locked also. There also seems to be a hole in the back of the house where you could stick a video camera in to look..There was a lot of screaming/torture sounds coming from the nearby area. It was south of the house, and theres animals over there... Users/PatrickFish

20060220 11:09:43 nbsp I was there with PatrickFish yesterday, and as he said everything is boarded up with no place to get inside. Also, there were every few seconds, loud screaming or torture sounds coming possibly from a building to the very rear. Im not sure, but my guess would be that that is a sloughterhouse. We went back there on a road and didnt hear any sounds once there, only at the house, and there were cows and other animals in this area  fenced in... Users/JeffBoyce

20060313 17:15:14 nbsp Im sure the police would leave a nice offical threatening note if it was actually written by them, and they would probably make sure to spell everything right. Users/BonnieStewart

20071205 04:09:09 nbsp Im a student pilot at CAFF, and bike through this area several times a week. I can confirm that during both day and night Ive noticed screaming sounds near the vicinity of this house (though they sound as if theyre far away, possibly south of the house). Ive heard that primate research is one of the things they do near this area but I cant confirm this.  Users/AnthonyLam

20080619 17:28:06 nbsp I found another Baxteresque creepy house thats over on the north side of Brooks Road, a few hundred feet from the northeast end of the road. It has broken windows and a garden that appears not to have been groomed for at least a decade, but there is still stuff inside like old chairs, dressers, and a whole lot of other stuff like coolers and whatnot. I would have done a more complete reconnaissance, but I was alone on a bike and it was twilight and the whole area was kinda freaky anyway. Users/JoePomidor

20081013 16:43:25 nbsp me and some friends have dropped by that place every once in a while, and we know that its doors are usually locked. one time recently we were walking around it and the side door was wide open. it kinda tripped me out haha because i was expecting it to be closed and locked. needless to say we looked around inside. it was exactly as described above.

nearby the baxter house, there is a cluster of laboratory facilities similar to this one, and theyre all abandoned and still full of equipment. some of them showed signs of hobo activity, and others showed evidence of a sperm bank: porno mags everywhere and containers of dried up white stuff haha..

we also followed the screams of torture.. over fences and up and down ditches.. to a nearby barn full of fenced in pigs hahah. i guess pigs can make screaming sounds when theyre pissed off? haha but yeah still a creepy place Users/AndrewFoot

20090112 20:46:32 nbsp We and some friends wehnt to the Baxter House. It was at the night time with monkey scream heard in farway distances. The door let us in, we found some old porn magazines. Last night I revisited this place, I had a moment alone with the old home. Two bicycles were left in the front yard, I got scarred and I thought maybe my friends had visted too and were gone. I saw police sign and thought maybe they had saved my friends. Overall it was a very enjoyable night. Users/JapanezerScrooge

20090304 14:47:38 nbsp OK this is going to sound weird. What is this place? I woke up last night and had the thought in my head that I had to check out the Baxter house that was going through my head until I finally wrote it down. I got home from work and on metacrawler I typed in the Baxter House which led me to this page. What is the deal with this place?
Any information would be great because Im confused. Email whiskylover@emailaccount.com

btw I have never even heard of Davis let alone the house. I do live in California now, but I am Scottish and have only lived in the US for a few years.

Thanks Users/metalhead1973
   Maybe you should go to one of the Bed and Breakfast places. It was search result #16 without  and #8 with it. Clearly you should drive up from SF and come visit....

20090316 11:01:46 nbsp Is the place hard to find? Users/metalhead1973

20090408 23:38:10 nbsp Theres now a gaping hole where the AC unit in the pictures was. Theres also a newlooking fence that completely surrounds it now. Users/btronclassix

20090625 17:04:50 nbsp If you want to see this place, better hurry up.  Theyre going to burn it down in a few days. Users/SteveDold
