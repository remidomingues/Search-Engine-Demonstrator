Will was a customer at this shop several years prior. After buying his first real road bike here he befriended the owners and was eventually offered an opportunity to apprentice under Mike, an offer Mike had never offered anyone before. Will learned many things and is still learning. But the greatest thing Mike taught me, was to have confidence to believe in myself and figure things out on my own. I am not Million Mile Mike, but I do commute 36 miles a day on my bike to do the thing I love. And I strive everyday for the same kind of excellence Mike and Kim offered.

The Bike People were originally located on University Avenue.

20110918 15:42:38 nbsp Went in for a estimate for a broken spindle. They wanted $60 for part and repair. Sounded like they were going to replace it with a used part too(not 100% sure). Got it fixed at Bike Barn instead.

Kevin Users/kkha91

  I think that $60 represents their standard fixedprice whatevers wrong, well fix it price. If you can do the repairs yourself, head around the corner to the Bike Collective. Users/Flynn

20110919 21:18:51 nbsp Kim told me that theres been a strong demand for their bikes with a buzz of Wiki, Wiki, Wiki!  I told her thats the best wiki response that Id heard of.  I suppose a lot of the customers were new students that had heard about the Davis Wiki or searched online for a bicycle. Users/BruceHansen

20110926 14:34:30 nbsp Mike and Kim were very personal, and managed to convince me to by a more expensive cruiser (with front suspension and seven speeds) instead of a junky road bike. The cruiser rides like a dream. When I had some problems with the chain, Mike showed me how to maintain my chain and gears, free of charge. The Bike People arent trying to take your money, theyre helping to build a stronger Davis community.

20110927 19:03:30 nbsp My bike has been in my family for years my Dad bought it for my Mom in England in the 60s and I was given it when I moved to Davis 6 years ago. It is an old Centurian street bike with airless tires that I absolutely adore. I had been looking for a place to have it tunedup and repaired because the Bike Barn would not touch it they said it was too old and every time I took it to B&L it came back more broken. I was about to give up on my beloved bike and just buy a new one when I came across Mike. He soundly like he really knew what he was talking about and that he loved and cared for old bikes as much as I do. I loved his philosophy of keeping old bikes alive and it sounded like he was more interested in doing good quality work that he was proud of than just cranking through bikes as quickly as possible to make more money.

When I brought in my bike he remembered the conversation we had had and looked eager to work on it. He told me that there was nothing really wrong with it and that is just needed a good cleaning and tuneup, he estimated 60$, which was way below what I heard from B&L for at best questionable work, so I left it with him. Kim called me back to let me know it was ready. She was incredibly sweet and helpful! You can just tell that she really cares about their customers.

When I came in the bike was ready to go. I took it for a test ride and it was amazing! Riding it was effortless. He made it easier and better to ride then I thought was possible and had fixed things that I did not even know were wrong with my bike.

I will never take my bike to anyone else and have already took a bunch of my friends about how great my experience was here.

  Users/DanielleC

20111002 22:03:13 nbsp Went there last week after I saw their ad and bought a pretty nice bike with reasonable price. People are friendly and the guy knows what he is doing. He seems really experienced and make a real bike from dead parts! If your budget is tight here is the place you want to stop by.    Users/Khaled

20111021 18:20:29 nbsp some of the best service you can expect anywhere. i was amazed at the philosophy of this business, which is to simply keep the old alive  an anticonsumerism business. why trash your bike when you can improve it? if youre fond of recycling, saving money, and supporting a true independent business, take your business here! Users/ChristineHouldsworth

20111029 11:39:44 nbsp I am now the happy owner of a refurbished road bike built up by Mike.  He explained his rational for choosing each component and gave me specific tips to maintain my bicycle for the long haul.  Kim and Mike were congenial and I did not feel at all pressured to make a purchase.  Mike pays attention to the details  he made minor adjustments to the seat and handle bars so that the fit would be perfect.  He even added a bottle holder to the frame after I bought the bike and helped install my bike rack.  I will be back to the Bike People for any repairs because they know each individual machine inside and out.  Overall, it was a fantastic visit, due in part to the owners decades of bike experience.      Users/RachelGlaeser

20111104 13:32:17 nbsp Some of the nicest people Ive met in a long time work here. Extremely helpful and great prices! Users/notanickname

20111114 16:14:57 nbsp Hands down the best bike shop in Davis.  Mike will make your old bike better than new, or build one from the ground up to fit your needs.  If you are on a budget, dont go anywhere else. Users/JHayes

20120131 17:34:33 nbsp Excellent service and super fast turnaround.  A couple of the most personable and honest folks Ive met.  Also, Mike may arguably be the most skilled mechanic in town, custom fabrication is his thing.  Save your time and skip the salesman BS found at most larger shops... Users/dennis.brovald

20120212 18:50:27 nbsp Best bike place in Davis!  Kim and Mike are such down to earth people!  Really reasonable prices for reused parts too.  They do a 90day guarantee for students and you can tell theyre genuine and honest about their business and the parts they provide.  I recommend everyone makes this their first stop if theyre in need of bike parts/used bikes! Users/VictoriaR.

20120215 14:50:28 nbsp I bought a secondhand bike for $180 from The Bike People when I arrived in Davis in October. There were a few teething problems, but The Bike People are always happy to help and it was all covered by the 90day guarantee. Even though the guarantee has now lapsed, they still fix small things for free, like a damaged chain. They are really friendly, knowledgeable, and its the perfect place to go if you need a bike to get about Davis. Users/TommyCollins

20120405 13:39:41 nbsp Just took my daughters bike in for a minor repair and discovered there was no cost since the bike was under a three month warranty after the last tuneup. Where else in town are you going to find service like that? Look for the Bike People tucked away on L street! Users/ReneeNewton

20120405 22:22:23 nbsp I took my bike back for a problem I have been having with my seat. It has been tipping when I ride it which is no fun.

Mike helped my figure out the best way to correct the problem, which was just replacing a clamp. I also found out that they sell recycled bike seats and will recover bike seats! I love how much they do to recycle and reduce the amount of bike parts that end up in the landfill. They also try to use as little paper as possible in their business office, which I love.

When I came to pick up my bike I found that the clamp was fixed and my seat was recovered. I let them know that I had wanted to wait to recover the seat, to make sure that my problem was really with the clamp and not the seat. They immediately apologized and told me not to worry about the cost of recovering the seat because of the miscommunication.  What more could you ask for, they are local, familyrun, ecofriendly, professional, and honest!

I will never be taking my bike anywhere else. Users/DanielleC

20120415 20:21:13 nbsp I love the bike I bought here, its exactly what I wanted.  Mike and Kim are really nice and want to help you find the right bike for you.  and they dont judge you at all if you dont know that much about bikes!  Ill be taking my bike here even after the 90 days are up because theyre awesome people who love bikes! Users/Maria.M

20120505 14:46:19 nbsp I bought a used bike there. After ~3 weeks, there was a problem with the left crank. He replaced the whole crankset free of charge, and lent me a bike during the repairs. Very satisfied; would recommend. Users/PierreAndreNoel

20120514 16:36:09 nbsp WOW, what a great place to buy a bike. I have worked in customer service for years and these people have great customer service. i wont even go into detail just trust me, they care about the customers and are put on this earth to provide great custom bikes for very cheap prices. example...they made me a custom bike worth $600.00 for $100.00...... you can pick out what you want and they build it for you in a week. they were down to earth, honest and hardworking. i have purchased two bikes from them, one for me and one for my girl friend and both are in perfect working condition...the bikes they sell are worth so much more then what they sell them for because their goal is to provide the community, especially hard working/studying college students with an affordable quality means of transportation...
(you can go back at anytime to them for adjustments to your bike)....THEY ENJOY WHAT THEY DO....they are not in it for the money!! Users/marleybaby

20120526 15:12:09 nbsp Found a great bike for our youngest  great bike, perfect fit, great price and, most important, great people to help us find the right bike. Even better: student/homeschool discount. :) Users/JessicaKelly

20120702 21:07:20 nbsp Mike and Kim are AMAZING. They legitimately CARE about you, your safety, and your overall wellbeing as an individual. After being scammed on craigslist, they supported and helped me get through the whole ordeal. They took their own time to help me get my money back, and through it all, Kim encouraged me to stay positive. She seriously restored my faith in humanity. I have never met such genuine, CARING people. They are AWESOME! It is so rare to find such caring people that are so knowledgeable and experienced with bikes as well. Meeting them was a huge blessing in my life, and I will forever be grateful for how selfless and caring they are. I will definitely be going to them for ALL my bike needs for the rest of my life. They are the epitome of good people, and its such a relief to know that there is finally a bike shop that is working not for profits, but for your good, and your safety.  Users/Leesa

>>>HI LEESA, THIS IS MIKE AND KIM WITH THE BIKE PEOPLE....THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR KIND WORDS! YOU WERE A DELIGHT TO WORK WITH AND AN AWESOME NEW EXPERIENCE FOR US TOO! MOST OF ALL WE ARE SO HAPPY TO KNOW THAT YOU WILL KEEP A SMILE THROUGH LIFES CHALLENGES!!!!

20120712 19:11:32 nbsp Mike and Kim did an awesome job helping me repair my vintage 3 speed raleigh. While most bike shops laugh when you bring in a bike like that (if they know how to work on it at all), these guys were overjoyed at the opportunity to work on such a neat bike. They replaced a crankset which has been causing nothing but trouble for the three years I have owned the bike. If you have an old bike that is hard to work on and get parts for, look no further than this shop. They were extraordinarily helpful, and offered services at a reasonable price. The only thing I can ding them for is that they only take cash, it would be nice to have the option of using plastic! Users/NyssaSpector

20120730 11:42:18 nbsp My boyfriend and I came here on Saturday in the hopes of finding a road bike for each of us.  We have friends who have been into road biking for some time, and have decided that we needed to get into the scene. Being postgraduate students, we definitely did not have the type of budget to buy the bikes that our friends were riding.  We did a ton of research, even read ratings online on the bikes that we were thinking of getting... We did not like what we learned.  What we learned was that some of the cheaper entry level brandnew road bikes that we were planning on buying, ended up falling apart within a few weeks!  I was definitely worried.  After getting advice that it may be better to buy an quality old bike than a new cheap bike from the store, we decided to try out The Bike People in the hopes of finding something decent in our budget. We did so much more than that.  Mike and Kim were more than happy to answer all of our questions regarding the bikes that they had, each components of the bike, how to properly shift our gears etc, etc.  We had loads of questions and each were answered by either Mike or Kim.  We ended up buying a road bike from them, which we absolutely LOVE!

What I love about this place is that everything is recycled, the bikes are recycled, the components are recycled.   I love how everything could be brought back and reused to its fullest potential.  The shop is very bare bones  when you come in, do not expect a fancy bike shop that will woo you away with all of its gloss and polish; but do expect two individuals who have a passion for fixing bikes, riding bikes and have the absolute knowledge and experience and to help you find a bike that caters to your needs and/or fix your bike.

The bike that we bought is a prime example of how something old could still be just as good as something new.  We ended up buying a 1980s Shogun Road bike (even older than us) and yet it rode as smooth as ever.  I was so surprised when I first got on the bike and started pedaling, how quickly I was able to accelerate and feel the wind blow on my face as I rode through the neighborhood.  It was around 12pm, the peak heat time in Davis, and yet I felt so comfortable.  There were absolutely NO squeaking or whisping sounds while I was riding and the bike ride was so effortless and enjoyable.  My boyfriend rode the bike and fell in love with it.  We have about the same inseam, and so I decided to buy the bike for him as an anniversary gift; but truly, ever since weve had it  Ive been hogging the bike the entire time.

The great thing about buying here is the 90day guarantee.  It is so convenient to just stop by and have them look at your bike and fix it versus buying a new bike from a big name manufacture.  For example, if something were to happen, you would have to ship the bike back to the manufacture, or you could have take it to your local bike shop and pay a fee to fix it.   I felt that it was a better bet to buy from them because I could simply bring my bike over whenever I had a problem.  They are not only willing to fix the bike for you, they are willing to TEACH you if you want to learn.

If you have a broken bike, or an old bike thats been sitting around and would like to bring it back to the road  I definitely recommend coming to The Bike People to fix it.  Not only does Mike have the experience to fix the bikes, but they both truly have a passion for riding.  I have been telling my friends and family about the incredible two people that I have met in the little bike shop in Davis.  I am planning to have Mike build me a bike once I become more experienced in riding. I believe he has the skills and ability to build me the road bike of my dreams.  Thank you, The Bike People!

P.s. I noticed they didnt have a business listing on yelp, so I decided to add their business and duplicate my review there. http://www.yelp.com/biz/thebikepeopledavis2 Users/Marinaa

20120902 23:13:33 nbsp As you can read below from other customers comments about the top quality service of this bike shop, I fully agree and confirm that The Bike People really are the most amazing bike people that carry an immense surplus of knowledge, information, and experience in the biking world.  Mike really is a jewel of the bike era and certainly knows what he is doing and, quite frankly, seems like he can build you just about anything that will suit your needs.  If you dont find a bike he has already beautifully retrofitted from all his recycled, but clean and refinished, parts, hes got the skill, ingenuity, enthusiasm, and resources to build you a bike when you choose or find the right frame to begin your well worth investment.

My first bike I bought from Mike and Kim was a completely restored 1967 Schwinn sport bike that has become a great hauler for around town.  When I first bought the bike, the shifters were being finicky (what can you expect from 45 year old parts) and I had to take it back to Mike for some adjustments a few times, until he just decided to replace the shifters and the derailleur all for free (as it was all under his 90day maintance guarantee).  I was commuting about 8 miles/day 34x/week on this classic rider until I realized I needed a faster bike.  I was going to have Mike custom build me a road/touring bike as soon as the right size frame showed up.  He was super confident that he could build me exactly what I wanted for the price I was wanting to pay for a good quality bike (and do keep in mind that if you do want a bike that has top of the line parts and will last you for a while, if not forever, and that is custom built by a more than qualified bike mechanic/builder, you are most likely going to have to pay at least $500, but it is certainly well worth the investment when compared to buying a $500 mass manufactured in China bike full of limited warranty cheap plastic parts).  Even though most of the bikes that Mike has already made are mostly (if not completely) made from recycled parts, if you want to pay the extra cash to upgrade your bike, he probably can get you brand new, top quality parts to add on to your bike for a totally reasonable fee, as there is no middle man here.

Long story short  I didnt end up having Mike build ME a custom made bike as he had offered to sell me a custom built bike he made for himself if I was interested in paying the extra bucks for a major upgrade to something that would truly last me a lifetime!  I couldnt turn away from the opportunity to invest in a bike that was built with so much love, hard work, great pride, and superb quality that I knew would give me the ride of my life.   Mike even gave me an extremely valuable shifting tutorial to ensure that I knew how to shift without stripping my gears and cause unnecessary, but detrimental, damage.  Furthermore, Mike and Kim genuinely assured me that I really was making an great investment in something superb (and trust me they surely arent like other sales people from many retail shops that are just trying to get you to buy something so they can get the commission).  If you allow yourself some time, talk with Mike and Kim about what you really want, how you want to ride, how much you plan or do ride, and they can fit you to the right bike if they have it in stock, and if they dont have one already made or ready to go, they will tell you so, instead of just trying to sell you one that they already have that may not be the right bike for YOU!

Again  the Bike People are genuine people with great hearts, a passion for biking and a focus on keeping people happy, safe, and excited to ride.

Do yourself a favor and check these guys out, even if it is just to get some information about how to make a good bike investment, and you wont be disappointed.  Users/katalina

20120922 01:23:21 nbsp I came to the bike people first thing when I was an incoming freshman to UC Davis. They had custom built me a perfect single speed fixed gear bike, just as I had asked. From the minute I had walked in the door, Mike and Kim had treated me like family, and continue to do so, no matter whats wrong with my bike !! I am proud to show off the bike they had built for me, and also very cautious about locking it up, as they had given me great advice regarding the security of my bike. I have ridden  a number of fixes, but none can compare to the speed, smoothness, lightness, and perfect chain ratio, as well as its good looks ;) Users/NicholasVitagliano

20121114 08:12:31 nbsp Good service. Really friendly people. Fair prices. I am going back. Users/WarrenJones

20130303 21:21:55 nbsp So just starting to plot to tour the central coast of cali, a non mechanically or particularly bike knowledgeable mid 20s gal, but fit & .with a lent old bike frame that fits me, thats of good quality in structure base , but lacking all else for my demands...Michael & kim not only have successfully started me with a portion of the bare minimum gear I need to accomplish such a trip, but additionally will be who I go to for ANY of my additional needs.... the clincher....being their unbeatable prices, & that i trust them completely to continue with their excellent service, knowing that if they cant provide me with what I need, they will be honest & direct me in the direction I need to accomplish my touring goals...not enough time to relay how awesome these folks are, carly Users/carlyfarris

20130310 01:02:32 nbsp Okay I can write a 10 page essay on why you should go to the Bike People. Mike and Kim truly believe in meeting the needs of their customers. Their incredibly extensive and reliable knowledge of bicycles make them absolutely trustworthy. They really care about the Davis community and that is why they look out for their customers so much. I got into a pretty bad accident a month ago and needed a quote on my damaged bike. Mike and Kim were so helpful in choosing the next step on what to do. Ultimately, I decided to get a new bike for the sake of my safety, which Mike and Kim SOOOO greatly emphasized! Thats the thing. They really looked out for me, a stranger. I felt zero pressure in purchasing anything from them. I know it sounds skeptical for you the reader looking at this strangers review but I am completely honest. The Bike People are genuine bike lovers who know what they are talking about and care SO much about your safety!! I love knowing that I can trust them. I seriously plan on visiting them every chance I get to learn more about bikes and just hangout with them because I think they are amazing people. Davis is such an awesome place filled with awesome people I swear.

I was excited to learn more about maintaining my new bike, so I bombarded them with so many questions. And they answered with interest and excitement! Wow. They actually give me free information and knowledge that, honestly, would in reality leave me a smarter cyclist who doesnt need their help anymore. Business speaking, that doesnt sound profitable. BUT IT IS. I truly know that Mike and Kim are not interested in the money. I mean yeah they gotta make some $$ to survive, but thats not what they are about. They are literally bike people. You can bet that I will be a loyal customer coming back every chance I get for every chain replacement I need, every time I need to pump my tires, every time my brakes start screeching, every time my gears start screeching. These are the people to go to. They have earned my respect and I am so happy to have received such great great GREAT customer service.

ALSO. FUNNY THING. At the Bike People, I was loading a bike into my car and I irresponsibly left my keys in the trunk... Guess who got locked out! But Mike and Kim were SOOOO hospitable during my hour waiting for triple A. They gave me a drink, even put on a movie (Shrek, holler!). And as they were fixing a bike, they invited me to take a look at what they were doing and learn some amazing maintenance strategies. I cannot tell you how much I love these people and Ive only seen them like three times. GO TO THE BIKE PEOPLE. THEY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT. THEY WANT TO HELP YOU. THEY WANT YOU TO BE SAFE. THEY WANT YOU TO BE A SMART CYCLIST. I am MORE than happy to pay them to fix my bike, to buy another one, to take them out for lunch! They are such wonderful people. Ill stop here but wow, thank you so much Mike and Kim for being there for me and watching out for me after my accident! Users/ChelseaS

20130425 14:19:41 nbsp Very first visit was earlier this year after getting my bike stolen. Kim and Michael were wonderful in helping me to figure out what to do next ( check other bike shops, police reports, craiglist lookout) regardless of the opportunity to replace my previous bike at their shop. The Bike People are not about jacking up prices or trickery, they truly want riders to have the best experience bike riding. I shopped for a new bike around town, craigslist, as well as keeping an eye out for my old one. When all else failed, the sympathy and helpful advice from the Bike People led me back into their shop to take a look at potentially getting a recycled bike. Not knowing much about bikes, Kim and I developed a vision for what I wanted in a bike such as raised handle bars, fast ride, commuters basket, etc. Luckily, being a recycled bike shop, there were many options to choose from. I also got key advice to have the best possible protection so this bike doesnt get stolen (Tow chain & Padlock). Although my bike is made from recycled parts, the Bike People and I designed one that fits my needs and vision (which is possible when creating a bike from the ground up). I now know how to maintain and proudly ride it around town, having it be everything I hope for. Thanks Bike People for making my visions a reality and always being their for giving tips, answering questions and being AMAZING People.  Users/ChriselleJVinson

20130519 15:54:21 nbsp I knew Mike and Kim before they opened their shop so trusted them.  I have a 43 yr. old Peugeot bought new in Davis and have moved it all around the country.  Mike did a complete tune up on my beloved bike and its just like new!  He went the extra mile and completely cleaned and lubed everything and also installed a basket for me.  Mike and Kim are honest and do great work for reasonable fees and Im happy to recommend them for repairs or to find a good used bike.  You wont be sorry!  JoAnn R.   Users/JoAnnRonning

20130525 11:33:31 nbsp I highly recommend The Bike People, (Mike and Kim) for repair or to find a good used,recycled parts bike!  I took my 43 yr. old Peugeot and Mike went above and beyond getting it all cleaned and lubed.  It feels like Ill have it as long as I can ride it which makes me very happy!  They are honest and caring and Mikes practically lived on his bike his whole life so who better to take your bike to? Prices are fair and they try hard to accomodate your needs.  Ditto to all the good comments Ive read here!  JoAnn R. Users/JoAnnRonning

20130615 12:15:16 nbsp My sister recommended these guys and I cant believe I didnt know about them sooner! Awesome customer service and really just nice and goodintentioned people. They are willing to work with exactly what you want in your bike. The bike they made for me is a lookalike to my sisters and I absolutely love it. They gave me a really light frame and painted it beautifully, so not only does it ride like the wind but it looks good too. It was the best decision I made buying from them! I finally found my perfect bike (and it was made personally just for me)! Very happy with the bike people and the service they provided  Users/ThereseBuo

20130623 06:51:32 nbsp I wish we had known about this little shop sooner!  Since they dont use business cards (a conscious choice they said was meant to save the environment from additional paper waste), this ma and pa shop is Daviss best kept secret.  Mike is the original founder of the Davis Bike Collective (which is now under different management) on the same block as their store.  I have only gotten to know one other business in my life that was as dedicated to serving people even at the expense of being very profitable.  They choose to limit their selection to donated bikes that they themselves repair and rebuild, as opposed to buying and reselling bikes, so they can honestly say NONE of their inventory has come from Daviss stolenbike market.  My wife and I came in yesterday to buy a new bike for her  we noticed the little sign on L street  and they bent over backward to do everything they possibly could to meet our needs.  When it came time to testride a bike, they encouraged my wife to spend lots and lots of time riding around wherever she wanted in town to really make sure the bike felt right; Kim encouraged me to go with my wife (as opposed to keeping me there for collateral, the way a salesperson at a different bike store had put it earlier that morning), and Kim even loaned me her own bike to use.  When it came time to leave, we gladly donated my wifes old bike, and since I will need a bike soon too, I left my name and number for them to call when a bike matching my request came along.  I have great respect for their mechanical expertise, their customer service that comes from love, and their motivation to teach people how to take care of their own bike maintenance: we will be back to use this place as our local bike mechanic until we move from Davis.

20130623 10:26:29 nbsp This shop sounds incredible, but looking through the comments I notice an overwhelming amount of positivity which is great however, when you look closer it seems to be all fake.  This guy is not the founder of the Davis Bike Collective (The Bike Church). Look at the user history of a lot of these posters and you will notice how most of them have just posted on this page and have similar names.  Lame. Users/bunsey

20130626 07:43:57 nbsp I for one can attest to the fact that OliviaBuo and ThereseBuo are wiki user names created by my sister and I, for the sole purpose of commenting on this wiki page. If you still doubt our existence, look above for our picture with Mike.

I would like to comment on other wiki pages in the future, when I experience something similar to the excitement I had on first riding my sweet aluminum Schwinn. I look forward to meeting more awesome Davis businesses in the future! Users/OliviaBuo

20131202 09:09:30 nbsp A great shop; Mike and Kim are very friendly and very helpful!  They are localmentality people that love helping, and will do anything they can to get you riding again.

My wife and I initially went in to check out replacement options for our stolen bikes.  Mike apologized for not having any bikes in my size ready to sell, but after talking about preferences, he offered to build one for me that would suit my needs.  Long story short, we ended up stumbling on some really good deals on craigslist, but otherwise would have come back to purchase bikes for both of us.

We ended up returning later with a couple very warped wheels from my wifes craigslist find, which Mike told us could be easily fixed within a couple days for a very reasonable fee.  Rather than having to wait a few days, we got a call from Kim that afternoon letting us know that the wheels were ready to go!  We picked up the wheels that day and they looked great.  Mike even added rimtape to one of the wheels for us.  I was concerned about the rear wheel that was severely warped when I brought it in, but Mike did a great job and my wifes bike works fantastic now.  Well definitely be returning for any service we need on our bikes.

We also ended up donating an old junker (to us) Specialized Hardrock to the shop, for which they were very appreciative.  The shop runs on donated bikes (to prevent any potential dealings with stolen bikes), and theyre very appreciative of anything that gets dropped off. Users/TadHashimoto

20140105 15:30:27 nbsp My bike I bought from my roommate started to fall apart.  I decided to try and fix it at the Bike Collective but the bike was too messed up and I too inexperienced at bike repair.  I then thought I should just buy a new bike.  I looked around because I knew I wanted to buy used.  I decided to try this shop.  I was blown away by the kindness of Mike and Kim.  We picked out a bike and they gave me an incredible price.  I then donated my junk bike.  A week or so later, my new bike was ready.  It looked and rode great!  Then disaster struck!  My bike frame broke one day (the welding connecting the center piece of the frame to the area where the pedals are became disconnected).  I went back to the Bike People and showed them what happened.  They then chose a new frame that was even better than my previous one and built my new bike with my old bikes components (that they had built for me).  A few days later my new bike was ready.  I am still riding the new bike and love it.  I highly recommend this place for both quality of the service and quality of the bikes! Users/PhilMann

20140605 12:44:07 nbsp The Bike People are still open for business despite what many people have been told by the Bike Collective (they are lying to people who are looking for The Bike People saying they are closed for good due to an illness in the family).  Dont listen to the Bike Collective as The Bike People are still a fully functioning shop and continue to provide the same high quality products with the kind of customer service you wouldnt find in many other places.  Please to support The Bike People and their mission to keep you riding safely.   Users/katalina

20140717 10:21:54 nbsp I loved this shop when Mike and Kim were running it but when I took our trailer to be fitted for a hitch the job was subpar and the bar was done with tape and wire!!  It broke the first time out with our dog in it and when we told Will he never offered to fix it but just laughed it off !!  I will not go there as long as he is running it!!  Mike would be very disappointed in the way his shop is now being run!!
