If you have stories about encounters with local birds, please add them to this page  The Bird and I.

 Birds I have Known 

   Do you know about the bright yellow feet of the SNOWY EGRET?  When they hunt along the muddy edges of waterways, a snowy egret will take half a step then shake those yellow toes and wait to see if any fish comes over to investigate the yellow worms.  So if you see a small white egret in the water and cant decide if its a Snowy Egret or a Cattle Egret, take a moment to see if it uses that stepshakepause stepshakepause style of hunting  unique to the Snowy Egret.

Redtailed Hawks command the highest perches of the summer in Davis. But on close inspection, some of them turn out to be something else. The reddish color of the Redtail will have migrated up to the shoulder of this other large hawk. Its tail will not be red, but boldly banded black and white, as are the back and wings. This is the Redshouldered Hawk. It perches on the wires, for example, on County Road 101a FStreet Extension, between the poles commanded by the Redtails. Both species are resident here yearround.

Davis is good for blackbirds. Yearround we have two redshouldered blackbirds (The Redwinged and the rarer Tricolor), and we see groups of the iridescent, yelloweyed Brewers Blackbird, with an occasional Brownheaded Cowbird mixed in. At the height of summer we have Brewers big brother, the Greattailed Grackle visiting the North Area Pond for a few weeks. And late in the spring we have the bright Yellowheaded Blackbird nesting in the Davis Wetlands.

  2013 March 10: We just went on the monthly (second Saturday) http://www.yolobasin.org/events.cfm#PublicTours YBWA tour, which was led by volunteer docents Rob Floerke and Ken Ealing  and it was WONDERFUL!  Ive been on many a beginning birding tour, but this was the best ever.  Their information was clear, their stories were great.  No scriptreading for these men!  Whatever was seen or found was immediately explained clearly.  When that little girl came up with a duck skeleton (feathered wings still attached), I was amazed at the info that fountained out.  Id happily go on a tour with either Rob or Ken again.  Hmmmm... maybe we will!  See you at the next second Saturday? Users/LoisRichter Lois Richter
