20070919 21:14:16 nbsp The new studio is stunning, and Meghans classes continue to be inspiring and enlivening. Long live The Bo Tree. Anyone looking for a real yoga community would be lucky to find this one. Users/Calvin

20080222 15:39:10 nbsp ive liked meghans classes in the past, but find that other instructors are often more centered and focused. overall this is a very nice studio and a very special place to practice yoga, tho i get the sense that theyd benefit from having a better balance of teachers.

20090424 08:13:56 nbsp The primary instructor, Meghan Bowen, left Davis in June 2008 and the quality of instruction has really gone down hill. The Bo Tree seems very amateurish and I dont like the vibe.  Users/janec

20090424 11:13:29 nbsp I just went for one class and was really impressed with the instructors (Christine) teaching ability.  I think it is a great environment for a yoga practice.  Users/YK

20090528 17:56:34 nbsp What a dump. I agree with Jane C that this place has seriously gone down hill. Total wast of your time and money i would have a beter yoga experience in my living room and it would be cleaner, too.

20090610 14:29:10 nbsp What a great experience I was able to pay online, and sign up for the classes I wanted online. All I had to do when I got there was sign in and begin  it was fantastic.
I sent a note to the owner Teri, and she responded in a few hours. Great service.  Not sure what a couple people refer to when they say it is not clean  maybe they were in a different studio.  Great vibe on the two practices I attended. The 5:30 class fills up fast so get there early. Users/Rebbax

20091004 18:06:33 nbsp this is my first yoga studio in davis and i can only say great things about it. I love the cork floors and wonderful lighting. they provide such a comforting and peaceful environment in which to practice. the floors are so quiet that you hardly notice when the teacher walks around or someone comes in late. i have only been to christines vinyasa classes and they are amazing. she is always willing to help you into a more challenging pose and allows each student to constantly challenge themselves. it would be awesome if there were better prices for students, but $110 for 10 classes is pretty good for the high quality that you receive.

20100428 23:16:51 nbsp This is the best yoga place ever in Davis. I am a very beginner, rescently got into yoga so much, and tried many different yoga places in Davis, but most places is just like watching DVD with sclient teacher teachers only name the position of Yoga, and usually I was busy with watching other people and try to mimic, and usually my mind end up being busy and tired and sometimes hurt myself becuase I did not know the correct way to practice yoga. In bo tree you can actually learn real yoga in a correct way. Instructors in bo tree always explain the details of different yoga poses.  There are many different teachers in this place, and I believe I attended at least half of them, and all of them were extremely nice, helpful and knowledgeable. You can actually practice highly quality yoga in this place, and by the end, your mind is very calm and relaxed in spite of quite intense yoga practice. Plus, this place is so clean and decorated nicely, contrast to other places in davisstinky and out of fashion. I highly recommand this yoga place, must be the best in this city.     Users/Eunlee
