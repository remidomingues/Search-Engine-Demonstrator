The Breakdown is a KDVS public affairs show hosted by Ryan Valentinsen.  The scheduled time is 8:30am9:00am on Wednesdays. The National news show first aired on June 27th, 2007 and will continue to do so during the summer.  Some may feel it is unique compared to the other KDVS Public Affairs shows, because it has a conservative perspective.

20070627 13:45:24 nbsp whats unique about focusing on a conservative prespective? Users/StevenDaubert
  Its just unique in the time and place because KDVS hasnt had a conservative show in a few years, by no real fault of our own. Users/ElisaHough

20070627 17:06:12 nbsp Ryan has a good talk radio voice and the first show presented a conservative viewpoint on immigration in a nice way (I dont recall hearing anything like ALIEN or something derogatory).  I hope that future topics go into less common issues because that would be healthy for the show to do.   Users/GregWebb
