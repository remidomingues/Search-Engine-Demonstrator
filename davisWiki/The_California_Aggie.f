 


 

Serving the UC Davis campus and community since Davis Timeline 1915, The California Aggie is the official campus Media newspaper. Its coverage includes UC Davis campus news, Aggie sports, science and technology, city of Davis and local news and the local arts scene. There is an opinion page that includes editorials authored by the Aggie editors, guest opinions, political cartoons and letters to the editor. The Aggie also publishes columns, a daily calendar of events, classified advertising, and of course, the crossword and sudoku puzzles, which may be the papers most popular feature (especially in boring lectures).

It can be found in every corner of campus, in front of most major lecture halls, and even in a lot of community locations outside of campus. The Aggie is a selfsustaining unit of ASUCD, meaning that it generates its own income (entirely through advertising sales) and does not rely on a yearly operating subsidy. The paper is distributed for free, and up until recently, was the last student newspaper in the UC system to publish daily. They have since reduced their circulation numbers and are only printing on Thursdays, although they do publish articles, columns and news briefs throughout the week online.

The Aggie also has a http://www.twitter.com/californiaaggie twitter feed for breaking news updates, links to Aggie articles and links to other items of interest to Aggie readers.

 The Staff 

Over 125 students work in various capacities for The Aggie, including managers, desk editors, photographers, writers, copy readers, layout artists, graphic artists, sales clerks and advertising representatives. The Editor in Chief holds the highest position at the Aggie, overseeing the operations of the entire organization. The Campus Media Board appoints a new Editor in Chief once a year.

 The Editorial Board 
The Aggie publishes editorials that represent the collective opinionFootNote(The process by which the board decides what stance to take is based on majority (not unanimous) opinion of the board, though they try to integrate differing opinions. However, the Aggie reads Editorials represent the collective opinion of the Editorial Board, despite the fact there may be disagreements and editors might not be present. The Editorial Board acts collectively in their decisions.) of the editors on a range of topics. The California Aggie editorial board is made up of the Editor in Chief, the Managing Editor and the news editors.

 Finances 
The Aggies operating budget for 20092010 was approximately $208,000. This budget covered stipends for editors and managers, printing costs, and the costs of running an office five days a week. All of the Aggies income comes from advertising sales. The Aggie had for the past few years been running a deficit due to a national trend away from print media advertising. This, however, has been reversed in 20102011.

The California Aggie is a unit of ASUCD, but is not governed by them in the way that other units are. ASUCD delegated control of the Aggie to the Campus Media Board through an amendment to the ASUCD constitution. The Aggie does not receive any direct financial contributions from ASUCD, but does get its space in Lower Freeborn Hall for free. The Aggie also pays ASUCD for their accounting. In the event that the Aggies reserves run out, ASUCD would be responsible for paying for any deficits that occur out of its own capital reserves.

 Special Issues 
The Aggie runs three special issues every year.
  The Orientation issue is geared toward new freshmen and transfer students and runs on the first day of Fall Quarter.
  The Best of Davis issue features the peoples choice for best business establishments in the city of Davis. UC Davis students, faculty and staff are eligible to vote. This issue runs midWinter Quarter. Best of Davis winners are listed on Davis Wiki for California Aggie/Best of Davis 07 2007, California Aggie/Best of Davis 08 2008, and California Aggie/Best of Davis 09 2009.
  The Grad issue is geared toward graduating students and includes many end of the year features. It runs with the last issue of Spring Quarter.

 History 

The California Aggie was originally called The Weekly Agricola, back when UC Davis was still known as the University Farm School.  The Weekly Agricola (If youre a Latin geek, The Weekly Farmer) was first published on September 29^th^ 1915.

The paper moved to using standard broadsheet in 1974; before that they used a tabloid format.  The Aggie used to publish a The California Aggie/Spoof Edition Spoof edition at the end of the year (or April Fools day).  The spoof edition was not published in 2004, due to unusually poor taste in the 2003 edition.  However, the spoof edition was revived Newsweak in 2005 and was received with much acclaim by readers.

http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/uchistory/general_history/campuses/ucd/studentpubs.html Incomplete list of former Editors in Chief.

The paper went from occasional color to daily color under the direction of then editor in chief Andrew Whelan in the spring of 2004. It went back to occasional color in Fall 2007 in an effort to stop the growing deficit in their budget. In 2009, The Aggie cut color altogether, and in Fall 2010, it began to print in color only when advertisers already purchased color ads.

Like any large longlived organization, the Aggie has had The California Aggie Controversies its share of controversies.

At the close of the 20062007 school year, The Aggie faced another consecutive year of deficit, this time approaching $120,000. The two Aggie staff members responsible for overseeing The Aggies finances at the time were business manager Mia Szmuch and advertising manager Christina Chin, who was responsible for the newspapers lack of advertising sales. Nevertheless, incoming editor in chief Eddie Lee and managing editor Caitlin KellySneed selected Christina Chin to again serve as advertising manager for the 20072008 school year.

As of January 2009, they no longer printed Friday editions of the Aggie in order to save costs. As of April 2013, they only print on Thursdays in order to save costs and increase quality and length of content.

The reason the website doesnt have a very extensive archive is that the website was moved to http://collegepublisher.com The College Publisher Network in 2005. That edition, operated by y2m networks, essentially used the Aggies content to generate revenue for their youth marketing division. It promoted web advertisements over the articles, leading you to have to scroll down before you could read any real content.  That version of the site made its debut on Friday, December 2, 2005; however, it did not feature any archives and broke all links to the old story urls. When they changed to the current version of the site back with Creative Media, College Publisher refused to give the Aggie a copy of the electronic archive, because theyre a bunch of dicks.  The new site, which came online in 2008, has much less advertising and links to AGTV stories included.  It also broke a bunch of wiki links again.

The Aggie had a long standing The California Aggie vs. ASUCD feud with ASUCD. The two formerly hashed out their differences at the end of the year with a sloshball game, but a few years ago, ties to ASUCD have become so strained that the Aggie played KDVS instead. In 2007, The Aggie staff played itself. The game picked up again in in 2009, where the Aggie beat ASUCD in softballsloshball. In Fall 2010, the two played kickballsloshball at ASUCDs request. The Aggie still won.

In Summer 2005, wiki:WikiPedia:Sudoku Sudoku was added by then Editor in Chief Daniel Stone and Design Director Users/JonasMari so that people have another distraction after they get frustrated with the crossword.

20100219 13:46:23 nbsp I have found the California Aggies Best of annual event to be incomplete and not a very good guage of what is good or bad in Davis by any means. For example, this years best of did not include nearly 60% of the businesses located in Davis at all, save for one spot where you could write in a vote on the Bookstore section. Another fault of the Aggies best of is the cover of the actual award insert. They photographed many establishments yet placed nonwinners on the cover of the article such as placing Dimple Records photo on the cover (the second place winner) over Armadillo Music (the actual 1st place recipient).

It seems to be a very tunnelvision style view on this fine city and its commercial locations. Users/WesOne

  Try reading some of the articles. Maybe I expect too much from students, but I find most of the articles to be very shallow and dull.  Users/hankim
   I agree 100%. The articles, while sometimes interesting, most often remind me of shallow, plastic self serving drivel on the part of the individual writers.  Users/WesOne

20100524 17:05:56 nbsp The unfortunate fact is that the Davis Aggie is inferior to some high school papers and is an embarassment for an otherwise outstanding University.

The reporting is shallow in all areas.  Even something as mundane as sports leaves much to be desired.  Why, for example, did a number of the womens volleyball players decide not to come back this year?  Perhaps not the most earth shattering question, but something beyond the rehash of the athletic department press release.  Aspiring future journalists should learn to ask questions which provide some enlightenment.

The columnists are also an embarassment, with much of the focus on their respective drunken escapades or embarassing behavior.  One would think, for example, that their might be an attempt to encourage debate over issues of broader interest.  For example, should the University continue with Division I sports at the present level?  Should it cut back?  Or should it discontinue them all together?  And the Aggie should report on how much is spent, how many are involved, graduation rates, how many athletes were below Daviss admission standards (and wouldnt be here otherwise.) Users/RMS

20110207 22:59:42 nbsp Tough crowd.  Users/RichardProcter

20110820 12:08:58 nbsp This is a great newspaper. I have never seen the student body so interested in reading news, thats for sure. I dont read it as often as I should though. I have had some friends who have been staff for the Aggie. They were dedicated to every aspect of their jobs, and really put out 100 percent to make sure the paper was as good as it can be. I know for some of you, the articles may not be to your liking, or the comics may not seem too funny, but this is a daily effort. These guys put in a lot of work, and try to please one of the largest UC populations in the state. So, I think we all need to give them a hand for their hard work. Thanks Aggie!  Users/davisaggie1

20140315 21:04:38 nbsp I find it very interesting that the financial problems for the Aggie started about the time that Lamar Heystek stopped writing for them.  I suspect that if he was still writing columns about Safeway, we might still have 5 issues a week. Users/BrentLaabs
