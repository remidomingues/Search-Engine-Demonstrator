  I would love to see this cartoon. It sounds to me like a bunch of people were getting their panties in a bunch for nothing, but maybe Im wrong. I havent seen the cartoon. Anyone have it to upload?
     Ive been looking for it for a while.  Its clearly not on the internet.  Ill swing by shields and take a photo of it.
