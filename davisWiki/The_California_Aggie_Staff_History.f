It is crucial to our shared history that we remember and value our predecessors and look to these forbears for either negative or positive examples of accomplishment. Given this credo, The California Aggie staff lists are to be recorded here for archival/historical purposes. Note: This is not a forum for negativity, more so a place of honorable space in history.

Maybe Aggie alumni/friends can update us on their current work here? Just put your current job next to your name. Itd be neat to see where people go.
