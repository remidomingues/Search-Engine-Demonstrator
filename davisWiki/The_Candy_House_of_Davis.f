The Candy House makes all kinds of beautiful pyramid shaped truffles, chocolate dipped fruits, and lovely shaped creations! There are numerous varieties including Amaretto, Frangelico, Strawberry, Grand Marnier, Raspberry, Apricot Brandy, Creme de Menthe, and White Russian. They sell gift baskets of varying sizes, some of which are actually made of chocolate.  Truffles often come in both large and small sizes.  During the Holiday Season, they usually have a whole lot of molded chocolates and fudges: anything from Santa, Reindeer, or even cars and sleighs. There are typically Free Food free samples of fudge at the main counter!

Sunny, the owner, had his store in San Francisco for 25 years before the building was condemned to make way for PacBell Park. This is possibly the most unassuming and friendly of Davis chocolatiers.  The store is set up as a walkin bakery rather than a sitdown Cafes cafe. They have only one table (with a chess board) and dont serve drinks.

Konditorei used to be here, before they moved to East 5th St.

 The California Aggie The California Aggie published an article about The Candy House in 2007, though it is no longer available online. Davis Life Magazine published an article about the place in 2008, but that too is no longer archived online.

20051203 18:58:55 nbsp Friendly owner, great chocolate! Users/SiennaGrass

20051216 16:09:30 nbsp I bought a couple of truffles and he gave me an extra one for the road!   Users/MarieHuynh

20051216 23:03:42 nbsp I like this place too. Chocolate! Good! Users/NickSchmalenberger

20060315 21:27:11 nbsp the people here are so nice and they give you free chocolate. The chocolate truffles are okay but the fudge is really good! Users/JessicaFu

20060406 17:18:51 nbsp I had the opportunity to try their truffles.  Good stuff!!! Users/GruntledMonkey

20061104 11:25:38 nbsp I love the place! Bought half a pound of fudge, and its delicious! Melts in your mouth, soft, and he gave me a little extra (maybe a quarter of a pound or so) for the road; the owner was really friendly and was the first who warmly welcomed me to Davis. Great place, great chocolate. Users/AlexNelson

20070411 17:29:46 nbsp Friend and I tried this place today since there have been much hype about it. Great chocolate truffles! The owner is very nice and gave us extra for the road. Next time I need to give small sweet gifts I will come here for it. I just need to not eat all the truffles at once... 0 Users/BrandonToo

20070610 13:30:15 nbsp Went into this place randomly after a friend remembered the aggie article. The chocolate covered peanuts are delicious, he gave free samples and a bit of fudge for the road, he gave some caramel (which was delicious) to my friend who sadly is allergic to chocolate. Users/DavidPoole

20070611 09:16:21 nbsp Most (or all?) of the truffles are made with liqueur.  That might be a plus for some, but I didnt like it  although I will say some of the truffles tasted more like liqueur than others, and as there are a lot of truffles, it might be worth doing some testing... In general I have to say that I prefer http://www.sees.com/ Sees truffles.  However, they did give us some free fudge, and it was really good, so I go back just for that. Try the tricolor (light chocolate, vanilla, dark chocolate) with or without coconut.  Users/CovertProfessor
  20070903 22:44:13 nbsp really? i thought you couldnt taste the liqueur sinces it burns off during the cooking process Users/joe
   20070903 23:05:48 nbsp The taste remains, its usually the alcohol that doesnt.  Users/EdWins
   20070909 21:31:40 nbsp the liquer in truffles is added after the chocolate is melted, and hence the alcohol does not evaporate. Therefore, you get the full liquer flavor.  This is not my favorite either, i actually prefer fruity truffles. Users/MattHh

20080215 13:31:51 nbsp Some of their truffles do contain liqueur, and I did not enjoy those flavors. However, I have tried a few which are pretty good and do not have that alcohol flavor (e.g. the one with the mint filling, and one with chocolate mousse filling I think?). I DO like their fudge! Users/at86

20080227 13:32:29 nbsp I received a box of chocolates from here for Valentines Day. Not only are they delicious and rich, they come with a little chart of all the flavors. Theyre so filling Ive nibbled here and there and have yet to make a substantial dent in my box! I need to visit this place! Users/MichelleAccurso

20080804 23:56:08 nbsp This place seems to have been closed the last few times I stopped by...Anybody got any info? Users/JoePomidor

20081022 12:23:57 nbsp OMG youve got to buy their fudge!!  All 3 flavors are delicious and sheets of it are made every morning so its super soft and fresh.  Theres a plate of samples by the registar.  Wish the location was closer to campusitll definitely boost businessbecause their chocolates are delicious and reasonably priced.  The truffles are really tasty also, though personally some of them have too strong an alcohol taste (I like the white russian and caramel truffles).  The owner is super nice!  He always lets me choose a sample truffle when I go for my chocolate fudge fix. Users/ViVi

20081106 23:15:01 nbsp I stopped by for the third time today and it was finally open!
I bought some truffles, and the owner was super nice and gave me tons of great recommendations since Im not really a fan of the liquor flavor.  He even gave me a really good sized sample of the tricolor fudge, which was absolutely DELICIOUS and melted in your mouth. Users/JennPham

20081125 15:09:17 nbsp It turns out the truffles arent nearly as good as I thought they would be. I tried the caramel and I think the decadence. The chocolate just was not particularly flavorful if that makes sense, but I am betting that people with different chocolate tastes would like them. The fudge was amazing, and the owner gave us quite a bit for free with our purchase. Theres a tricolored one that basically made me want to die because it so good. I am only exaggerating a little it was seriously the best chocolate ever.  Users/Kiran

20081211 15:37:11 nbsp The truffles are soo good, and the tricolored fudge is definitely amazing.  The owner is so nice and gave me a couple of freebies :) Users/acgushiken

20090630 22:15:36 nbsp Their fudge is definitely different than any other fudge Ive had before, but I loved the way it melted in my mouth. I tried the peanut butter and coconut truffles, both of which I could taste a hint of liqueur. I think because I dont drink alcohol this chocolate is not my favorite. However I could definitely see myself buying some truffles for my friends.

I also tried the caramel marshmallow almond thing, and it was very food but could use a bit more caramel.

I enjoyed the friendliness of the owner (and the free fudge) but kind of think this place would get more business if it started selling drinks and expanded its dining area. Users/BrookeB

20090723 19:57:25 nbsp I think this place is closed throughout the summer.
Every time I visited the place this and last month, it was always closed.
However, Im not sure if its every summer. Users/thisisht

20100131 10:11:30 nbsp sooooo good! Users/laquelle

20100509 09:25:17 nbsp The owner is super nice and their chocolates are excellent.  They have very good chocolate covered oreos for only $0.75 each. Users/DagonJones

20100629 06:17:47 nbsp I love this place for all my chocolate needs, however I feel there is too much stock put into their truffles. Are they great? Yes, but my money is best spent on the almonds covered in toffee and chocolate...mmmm I could go for some right now! Oh and the owners are very friendly and always (at least in my experience) give you something for the road (even though my fiancee very rarely allows them to leave the store).  Users/JamesKrause

20100724 17:37:24 nbsp Ive been here a few times. Each time Ive been, ive boughten three, maybe four truffles, and the owner gave me a couple ones to try for free. Delicious! Users/TerrenceMurphy

20101205 13:36:57 nbsp I LOVE THIS PLACE. Their truffles are sooooo good. Their fudge is to die for. The owner is super sweet. I like it better than Vevey or Ghiradelli or Sees. Users/lunelectronique

20110204 18:17:21 nbsp The truffles are so good.  The owners really nice, too, and he gives out free samples.  If youre wondering where you should go for Valentines Day candy, its here. Users/PerryEagleton

20110319 13:25:54 nbsp Im sad that after 4 years in Davis, today was my first time there. A truly nice owner and wonderful fudge, truffles, and other things. My favorite so far is the Rocky Road. Big marshmallows with melted chocolate and some caramel. Awesome. Plus we got some free stuff! Definitely will be back. Users/Sar58

20110514 15:20:15 nbsp I got chocolate covered cashews and some other things. It was so good! And he gave me some for free! Users/rachealgalante

20111202 16:25:38 nbsp Absolutely love this place. My only regret is that I do not have enough money to buy everything in this store. Users/MatthewPorter

20111216 15:28:29 nbsp Does anyone know how long The Candy House has been in Davis? Users/EliseKane

20120623 18:20:28 nbsp I came here today (saturday) at 5 and they were closed with no explanation posted in the window :/ Disappointing because I was counting on this place to get a gift for a friend and there are no other truffle shops in Davis aside from the extremely overpriced Mishkas

edit Went there again and had an okay experience customer service wise. Their chocolate is absolutely superb though, bought a big truffle for myself and two box sets as gifts :)Users/sundeimasu

20130410 15:52:07 nbsp Went there on a Friday at 6 PM, closed. No explanation.
Went there the next day, Saturday at 4 PM, closed. No explanation.
I have a feeling he just closes up whenever he feels like it instead of sticking to the posted hours. Hes definitely missing business acting unprofessional this way. Users/MatthewPorter

20130915 12:17:40 nbsp Went by there yesterday (Saturday) at about 3:30 and he was closed! I was kind of disappointed because my boss (fiancee) was having a rough week and I wanted to cheer her up with some fudge (her favorite). I think he took down his posted hours so that he can close when he wants, which kind of stinks. Its too bad though because I really like this place and I really could have used that fudge! Users/JamesKrause

20130924 10:06:26 nbsp I had this same situation (the shop being closed during posted business hours) recently.  I found their phone number, called them, and they opened the shop for me. So calling ahead may be the way to go. Great service otherwise, and great candy. Users/RobertRhode

20140719 13:46:01 nbsp I am pretty sure this establishment is not around to make business. I came at 5 PM on Friday (without posted hours) and it was closed, I called and no response. I then came at 11 AM the following Saturday and it was closed. I figured that maybe the owner went on an early lunch, so I sat for two hours until ~1:30. The store remained closed and no one answered the phone... I really wanted to surprise someone with chocolate but I had to go elsewhere to do that. Shame. And what a waste of time.
