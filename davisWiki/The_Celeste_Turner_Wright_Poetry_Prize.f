The Celeste Turner Wright Poetry Prize is sponsored by the Academy of American Poets, whose University and College Poetry Prize Program established in 1955 now includes about 175 colleges and universities.

Dr. Celeste Turner Wright (19061999) became the first woman professor on the UC Davis campus, where she was also the first Ph.D of either gender to teach in the humanities. Among other more scholarly work, she published three volumes of poetry: Etruscan Princess, A Sense of Place and Seasoned Timber. Her memoir, University Woman, appeared in 1981.

The competition is designed to encourage the artistic and creative development of student poets. The Academy of American Poets offers cash prizes of up to $100 for the best poem or group of poems by a UC Davis student, either graduate or undergraduate.
