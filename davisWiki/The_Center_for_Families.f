D Street House, Davis:

For 12 years, the Yolo Center for Families (http://thecenterforfamilies.org/) has been strengthening and supporting families and individuals in Yolo County by connecting them to community resources and services. Recently, in partnership with Davis Community Church, the Center opened up a resource center in central Davis, “D Street House” (441 D St.; 5307571261).  While many of the services offered at D Street House provide significant support for lowerincome families and individuals, the Center for Families also provides programs and connections to services that support individuals and families from all socioeconomic backgrounds.

The services and programs currently offered out of D St House cover four main areas: Family Support, Children’s Services, Health Services, and Access to Benefits. Examples of services/programs include case management, infant and toddler playgroups, parent education, child development screenings, Zumba classes, and food distribution. Please see https://www.facebook.com/dstreethouse for uptodate offerings.

Individuals and families can both give and receive at D Street House, so please consider serving as a volunteer.  Go to http://bit.ly/DstreetHouse for more information.
