Thank you for your interest in The Choice of Words! I decided to offer tutoring services in Davis because of my passion for teaching and writing. For a number of years I have been working as a ballet and modern dance instructor to teenagers and adults here. I love this work, and I encourage you to check out my TimothyNutterDance dance teaching. However, I have been longing to find more teaching opportunities with students working in an intellectual discipline. My education in college and graduate school (where I studied philosophy) required me to become an excellent writer, editor and writing tutor. How could I dovetail my love for teaching and my writing skills together into a new career path? The answer was simple: start my own tutoring business, focused on writing.

Through my work as a choreographer, dancer, musician, theater director, writer and writing tutor, I have become a believer in the power of revision to improve compositions in every medium of expression. But becoming good at revision, using it effectively and efficiently, can be difficult without help from a second pair of eyes. Thats one reason having a professional writing tutor can be a good choice for many students. Besides, writing can be much more fun when you work at it with an encouraging coach by your side. I enjoy helping young writers improve their written work, helping them discover the endlessly interesting and entertaining world of writingthe world of the choice of words!

Timothy Nutter is available to teach at the Davis location of your choice. His current rate is $45 per hour. Please contact him by email for appointments, questions and more information: timothy.t.nutter@gmail.com
