The Colleges at La Rue (more commonly known simply as The Colleges) is an apartment complex on the UC Davis campus but the buildings are owned and privately managed by Tandem Properties.  The Colleges are available only to undergraduates, except Freshmen firstyears.

Residents have commented that this is a stellar place to live for students because of its location and because only students live here.  Although there is a lot of activity going on, residents note that the units are very well insulated and that outside noise isnt a problem.  It seems like a great place to stay really integrated into university life with the benefits of modern apartment living.

When the complex opened it featured UC Davis Resnet in each room and apparently still does. The living rooms, kitchens, dining room, and bathrooms feature tiles. The rooms feature carpeting. Small caged pets are allowed with written consent from management. No other pets are allowed. Aquariums over 50 gallons need renters/waterbed insurance.

Some apartments are located on the ground floors. The other apartments are located on the second floors and are accessed by individual staircases for each apartment. There are barbecue areas. Storage spaces are available.

 Features & Amenities 


Additional Notes:  The Colleges use underground thermal loops for cooling. (citation needed)

 Mobility 
Public Transportation  The Colleges are on Unitrans J bus line, C bus line and D bus line, inbound only.  However, the Colleges is only a short walk to The Silo, where you can catch several other bus lines.

Bicycle  Since The Colleges is on the UC Davis campus, it is completely integrated into the Davis Bike Loop and there are bike lanes, bike paths, and bikeonly connectors on all of the surrounding streets.

Pedestrian  This complex is on campus, meaning that it is in a great location for students. The Colleges sit directly across the street from the ARC, yet offers its own fitness room.  The Rec Pool is immediately adjacent, and residents can easily bring just a towel and simply walk home to change out of their swimsuits.  For recreational adventures, walk through campus to The UC Davis Arboretum or walk through the Experimental College Community Garden and head past The Domes to the Bike Bridge over Hw 113 and explore the site of the new West Village.  During the Fall, residents only have to walk a block to watch UC Davis Football at Aggie Stadium.  During the spring, Womens Lacrosse also lays down the law at Aggie Stadium.

Since this is near an older part of Davis, the closest access to The Greenbelt is at Community Park.  For grocery shopping, some services, and dining, University Mall and Rite Aid are about 4 blocks away.  Residents at The Colleges have very close access to Trader Joes.

Parking  Residents have free oncampus parking at The Colleges.  There are a few 20minute visitor parking spots that people sometimes use as free parking for class (though they risk ticketing).  Residents have noted that in the past, TAPS does not come by to ticket as often as they do for the campus lots, they still do so occasionally, so its usually best to park only for short visits rather than leaving your car while you go to class.

ADA Accessibility  Some units are ADA Accessible.


 Leadership Learning Community  
To live in The Colleges, students were once required to be accepted into the Leadership Learning Community, which offered various extracurricular programs and events throughout the academic year.  Today, you need only to find an open apartment, which may still be a difficult task to the competition for limited space.  You must either find  a current resident to move in with or enter a lottery to obtain one of the few apartments that open up each year.  The lottery is completely random, with priority to current residents who are changing apartments.  Your odds of getting an apartment are much better if you know someone you can move in with, either under a sublease or as a coleaser.  Passdowns of apartments are strictly prohibited and your applications will be denied if a passdown is in effect.

As part of the Leadership Learning Community, residents were required to attend two 1.52 hour events (or a single longer event) a quarter.  Some found the programs useful, others enjoyable, and still others treated it simply as part of the price of living at The Colleges.  Beginning Winter Quarter 2008, residents of the Colleges are no longer required to attend events.  They are now strictly voluntary for those who seek their own professional development (in the case of leadership/careeroriented events such as resume workshops) or networking/enjoyment (in the case of community events such as ice cream and movie nights).

The Center for Leadership Learning is the home for several UC Davis leadership programs and is located at The Colleges.

 Apt Sizes and Corresponding Rents (2012/2013) 


The Colleges Apartments anticipate a 3% to 3.5% rental increase for the 2014/15 lease year.  Will update prices when they are solidified.

20060909 22:27:57 nbsp I got accepted into the program and was offered an apartment right away, along with the other handful of people I knew that applied. We didnt have to worry about a lottery, and it wasnt even mentioned. They do have a really neat system for finding and looking for roommates. Users/ChristyMarsden

20070202 09:08:16 nbsp There are ways to get around the lottery; it is possible to join a friends lease and then transfer to a new apartment. You get priority since youre technically already a resident. Only problem (or maybe not, if youre into it) is youre required to participate in the programs each quarter. Also, when I lived there (20052006) I dont think the lottery program was really in place; we received several emails reminding people that apartments were available if we had friends who were looking for a place to live.  Users/ElleWeber

20070928 11:09:49 nbsp I enjoyed living here. Im not sure if my neighbors were just quiet or the walls were soundproofed, but when they had stuff going on I could barely hear them. Although the walls within the apartment were paper thing. For a 100% student complex, parties never got out of hand and the campus police were always reasonable. I also found the units to be well insulated. Users/JamesSchwab

20100312 10:50:49 nbsp I do not know how its like to live here because I didnt get picked for the lottery. Actually, no one got picked for the lottery, because there were no apartments to give out. They had us sign up for a lottery where there werent even any rooms available. Im very glad me and my friends went to sign up for Tanglewood before they told us because if they hadnt then we would have been nearly screwed. Personally, I think its incredibly rude to not only make us wait this long to sign up for rooms (rooms should come by firstcome firstserve basis) but also to NOT INFORM US THAT THERE WERE NO ROOMS TO BEGIN WITH. I believe this was simply a ruse to attract customers to the apartments they were partnered with under their Plan B scheme. But thats just me. Btw, they have nice cupcakes.  Users/theshonen8899

20100331 10:21:33 nbsp @theshonen8899 –
Hey its management staff here!  We saw your comment and were concerned.  The Colleges at LaRue is the most sought after housing on campus and availability varies from year to year.  This year, so many of our residents decided to stay with us, that only one bedrooms became available for 2010/11.

I’m sorry that it wasn’t clear that many of our current residents would renew and that not all of our units would be available.

We believe that Tandem offers the most diverse array of apartments in Davis, so yes, we’ll take every opportunity we’re given to share those choices.

And thanks, we like the cupcakes too!
 Users/DeeE

20100509 20:49:13 nbsp I have to completely agree with the comment left by theshonen8899.  It was extremely messed up on the part of the management to have everybody come to that stupid event and then not even have any apartments.  Tandem Properties management is pretty messed up. Users/JSlice

20100516 13:12:19 nbsp @DeeE  There is a difference between wanting to share those choices and forcing them upon people under the pretense that there are actually a viable amount of apartments available. Finding housing was chaotic for me and my friends and we didnt need con artists to waste our time and make it worse. Attempting to control a monopoly where apartment complexes can only survive if they live under your hood is immoral and I hope future students will see through your scheme before wasting precious time looking for housing. Users/theshonen8899

20100702 18:09:57 nbsp Ive lived here for 4 years now and have loved it! Its obviously a great location, but the management has always been really wonderful as well. They do a great job maintaining the place, the very few problems Ive ever had were taken care of right away, and the ladies in the office are always very helpful and pleasant. The apartments are also very well soundproofed. Even when my neighbors had stuff going on, I could barely hear them. If you can get a spot here, which I know are hard to come by because people like me love it here and choose to stay until graduation, I highly recommend it. My ONLY complaint would be that its difficult to have guests over on weekdays because TAPS tickets in our parking lots and there are only 4 guest spots (at least in the north lot). But I know guest parking is kind of a pain at a lot of complexes in Davis, so its really not a big complaint. Users/LizaT

20100912 22:56:39 nbsp I lived here for four years and loved nearly every minute of it.  The management team is always helpful and I never went longer than 48 hours without my repair request being filled.  The things that I hated were more or less two fold: I lived in a single bedroom and the sinks are TINY.  Due to the fact that they are split in the middle, the sink is so narrow I cant put full size plates at the bottom of the damn thing.  Thats the only flaw I had with the apartment.  The other complaint isnt the Colleges fault but rather the (&#$ Banduh.  They like to practice inbetween the pool and the southmost part of the complex in the summer.  Despite my complaints in previous years they continue to do this.  I lived right next to the pool and no matter what I did, I was subject to their practices.  Even when on two separate occasions I was sick with a 100+ fever.  Banduhs response?  Cant you just go somewhere else?  No you inconsiderate boob, I pay to live here.  Why dont YOU? Users/OliviaY

20100921 12:57:32 nbsp Ive lived here for the last 4 years and just recently moved out to a complex down the street on Anderson.  I absolutely loved it here.  The location is fantastic and the management is great.  Maintenance issues within the apartment were taken care of the very day we would call in and the maintenance staff have always been courteous and helpful.  The grounds are always clean as they mow the lawn, trim bushes, etc. every Tuesday, I believe.  My only complaint would be the poor air circulation in our 2 bedroom apartment, but thats minor.  The place is well insulated and generally quiet.  Noise has never been an issue for me.  I already miss living here.  If I could afford it, I would have tried to stay here despite no longer being a student.  I highly recommend living here.  Great experience. Users/SharonLee

20101023 13:51:09 nbsp So I just moved into The Colleges in September with two other people.  I regret doing this more than almost anything else in my life.  Maybe we got a bad apartment and the rest of the complex is great, but here is my experience so far:

First, the floor was never cleaned after the last tenants moved out.  I didn’t notice at first since the tiles are dark colored but it became very obvious after the carpets in the bedrooms started turning black.  Three rounds with a mop (probably the first cleaning in years) and it still isn’t clean.  This probably explains the German cockroaches that outnumbered us from the day we moved in.

Second, Davis Wiki describes The Colleges as a quiet complex where “outside noise isn’t a problem”.  The windows are high quality doublepaned glass and block the sound fairly well.  However, The Colleges is right next to an outdoor day care center with dozens of screaming children from 8am to 6pm every weekday and no amount of insulation will stop that noise.  They even parade the children around the complex during the morning to ensure everyone is equally annoyed.  Don’t forget the loud parties – the police don’t seem to patrol this area, making it prime for parties that make The Colleges sound like Ket on a Friday night.

Finally, units in the same building are not well insulated from one another.  Our upstairs neighbors constantly sound like they’re playing basketball for hours at a time, with the stomping and bouncing continuing until 2 or 3 in the morning.  Occasionally (i.e. a few times a week) they play what sounds like a subwoofer audio test (or really bad techno), with loud random frequency sounds lasting for hours, rattling furniture in my room and keeping me awake until 2am when I have class the next morning.

The location is great and allows me to easily get out of the apartment and on campus to study.  I only wish I had somewhere else to sleep. Users/dpb

  The reality of of living in an apartment is that you share a wall and hear things on the other side.

  Have you tried talking to your neighbors at all?  Usually they dont even know they are making noise.  If that doesnt work Trish is very helpful in the office.  Make a complaint to her and it WILL be sorted out.  I had to eventually resort to that once because of a rude neighbor who simply didnt care.  As for the parties...they happen in every apartment complex.  Again TALK TO THEM if the noise is a problem or call the campus cops.  They break parties up very quickly but you have to go through the Campus Police, not Davis Police.  Trish is also helpful because if there is a specific apartment throwing lots of parties she intervenes.  I had this happen as well.  Basically befriend Trish and talk to her about these issues.  She doesnt bite!! Users/OliviaY

And the Colleges are only open to UC Davis students...I dont understand why you seem to think its a big deal that people have parties (which generally do go until about 2 in the morning, incidentally).  Sucks that the daycare children make noise all the time, but thats what little kids do.

It seems that your only complaint is about noise, in which case youre better off going farther away from the campus and getting a house. Users/sososharp

@OliviaY
Thats not necessarily the reality of apartment living.
  Not everywhere in California but in Davis it is.  Its a college town and college kids inevitably throw parties.  It still sucks but I think youd be hard pressed to find a single complex where there isnt one loud party in a 9 month period.  If you do Id be impressed. The comment above mine didnt come from me...but it is usually pretty true that when you share a wall youre going to have some things come through.  I couldnt ever hear neighbors talking but my alarm clock woke someone up once.  He was nice enough to leave me a note and I turned the volume way down.  Problem was solved.Users/OliviaY
@sososharp
No, noise was not my only complaint. Regardless, noise is an issue for some people, and this wiki is misleading: residents note that the units are very well insulated and that outside noise isnt a problem. Hopefully my review will balance the description that was probably written by Tandem Properties. Users/dpb

Sososharp: Imagine that you were a student who had an 8 AM exam the next day when someone decided to throw a loud party next door.  Or that you had to work to support yourself and had to get up early to earn money to pay your rent, tuition, and other bills.  Or that maybe you go to sleep at 12 AM every night and dont want to stay up until 2 because your neighbors do.  Or that you had homework that you really needed to concentrate on, and that you couldnt do that with the noise from a party entering your apartment.  Or maybe you just wanted to live in your apartment in peace without having to listen to party noise all the time.  If you are going to do something that you know is going to make noise and most likely disturb your neighbors, its your responsibility to ensure that your neighbors arent disturbed.  Its not your neighbors fault that you want to party, and it isnt up to them to put up with it.  Have some consideration for others.   Users/IDoNotExist

  IDoNotExist: I dont need to imagine, since I am a student of UC Davis who works a ridiculous amount of hours to pay rent at my place of residence, the Colleges at La Rue.  Im simply stating what is fact: if you move into an apartment complex which is only open to UC Davis students, you are going to deal with noise and your neighbors are going to throw parties.  Im not saying that Dpb doesnt have a right to be annoyed, but I am saying that youre only fooling yourself if you are expecting people not to throw parties.  Ill agree about the insulation not being as good as advertised...heck its not even close.  Users/sososharp

  For being so sharp, you have failed to realize the point of Users/dpbs comments. He never said that he didnt expect people to throw parties. He just didnt expect the noise to be a problem, based on some reviews claiming this place to be well insulated and even soundproof. As a resident of this fine establishment, I think these apartments are actually quite wonderful: I love the fact that when I moved in, my carpet had all kinds of cool stains left by the previous tenant. It really adds to character to this room. When maintenance came to remove mold and padding underneath my carpet due to a major leak, it was awesome  not only did they remove my closet doors and stack them in my hallway, they also never replaced the carpet padding! Its great because I can access my clothes more easily, and every time I do, I am reminded of how thankful I am for the padding on the other side of my room. I also really love being able to hear, in clear detail and through my walls and closed windows, the sounds of my upstairs neighbors talking, running up and down the stairs, and whatever else it is they do. Every once in a while, I even get the rare treat of hearing the people on the other side of the courtyard! You see, its pretty boring at 4 in the morning, and these little things really spice up the place and make me feel like a close part of the community. It doesnt bother me that Ive been unable to sleep and have been missing all my morning classes, because school is for losers. Oh, and what would I do without the roaches? Its so entertaining to watch them crawl around in the bathroom when Im taking a dump. They dont seem to like me though  they always end up hiding under the uncaulked floorboards. This place is so awesome, Im going to ask for a 5 year commitment when I resign my lease. Did I mention the rent? I pay $720/month  what a steal! I would gladly pay twice that. Users/btb

  Im not interesting in getting in a pissing contest here, but what part of this Don’t forget the loud parties – the police don’t seem to patrol this area, making it prime for parties that make The Colleges sound like Ket on a Friday night, doesnt sound like someone surprised about the fact that people are throwing parties?  That in no way is a complaint about thin walls or shitty insulation making his/her apartment noisier.  That is half a complaint about lax enforcement by the police (which is fair), and half a complaint about college students doing what college students do (which is unrealistic).  I did not say that Dpb doesnt have a right to be annoyed by the noise (I stated the opposite, as a matter of fact), but I am saying that he or she came in with unrealistic expectations.  Users/sososharp

20101102 07:56:11 nbsp I aggree with Users/dpb about the random noise from upstairs neighbors  while we didnt have a problem, it always sounded like they were moving large pieces of furniture around when in reality theyd only move a chair in or out from a table. Its ridiculous, noise transfer from top to underneath. Maybe its because of the tile floors? Users/ChristyMarsden

20101220 16:39:27 nbsp I moved in to The Colleges in September (2010), and have been nothing but happy with my experience thus far. As far as noise, everything is relatively quiet, in fact I rarely ever hear a loud party. So as far as The Colleges being a noisy or loud place to live, I believe that is relative to your apartments location (The Colleges is a large complex with the majority of apartments NOT next to a loud daycare) amd the people the live near you. The ladies that work in the office are very friendly and repairmen are an added bonus (there to fix pretty much anything for free!).

Not only is it the nicest and classiest apartment complex I have seen in Davis but it is also right on campus, making it truly the best place for students to live. It is slightly pricey, but the convenience is completely worth it!

Also, the prices on here are not updated for the new lease year: Four bedroom/2 bath is $2520/month.

20110622 00:13:50 nbsp Stayed here in the summer. Had a leak in our bathtub that i guess messed up the downstairs apartment too, so they told us they need to fix it and sent us to the Holiday Inn hotels in downtown for free service until it was fixed. Was very delighted with the situation (very nice hotel) until we came back and were expected to pay the $220 for the energy bill (they had to dry stuff overnight so a high powered machine was on 24 hours for a week) Users/JohnathonJosephs

  Hi JohnathonJosephs (Deirdre from the rental office here): We will typically reimburse you for the increase in electricity cost for the dehumidifier running.  We just ask that you bring your bill in along with another 2 so that we can verify the increase in cost.

20110905 23:35:33 nbsp I lived here for two years and it was amazing! A bit pricy but you definitely get what you pay for: youre right next to campus and you get great servicing on any issues about maintenance.
The easiest way to get a spot here is to find someone (through uloop or something) who is renewing the lease and needs to fill in spots, instead of the lottery system. Users/MarisolG

20120822 22:43:02 nbsp So glad Im only subleasing here. Its small, overpriced, and poorly lit. The washers are obnoxiously small, parking is inconvenient, and tenant are loud. I locked my keys in the apartment and called their emergency number; they said Youll have to call a locksmith. Whats considered an emergency, then? Being held at gunpoint? And if your tenants are paying over $700 a month for your cramped apartments, you can at least try to help resolve an easily fixed problem. The subleasing process was a hassle, too. They specifically wrote on the sublease form that the original tenant was not to give me his access card. Then, I go to the office, and they acted shocked that he hadnt given me his access card... Sure, its close to campus, but thats about the only pro I can think for this place. Users/Bohemian

  Dear Bohemian,
Were sorry to hear of your frustrations with the sublease process. While management authorizes subleases agreements, each sublease is an agreement between tenants so the way that keys and things are given differs from contract to contract. We apologize for any miscommunications that happened during your movein process. As for the emergency maintenance line, it is an outside service that we contract to help handle emergency maintenance issues occurring after office hourssudden water leaks and that type of thing. We typically give a hand out at movein that goes over which service to call for different types of after hours issues. Your roommates probably have a copy, but please feel free to come into the office if you need another one or have any questions about after hours help. Were sorry you got off to a bumpy start here and wed like to do what we can to keep you happy for the duration of your stay.

Best,
The Colleges at La Rue Management (NikiRose)

20130219 22:48:41 nbsp I highly recommend this apartment if you can win the lottery to get a room. I saw some other guy giving reasons as to why NOT to live at the Ramble on the other DavisWiki page, and I felt that was the best way of telling people about an apartment. Thus, Ill give my reasons why the colleges at La Rue are GOOD.

1. Good management. Theres about 3 people Ive seen regularly in the office. Theyre always courteous, and always answer your questions politely. Me and my roomates once forgot to turn in the rent by the 3rd day of the month, and were let down about the $10 late fee. When I went to the office to turn in the checks though, one of the managers told me that the checks would be cashed on Friday, and that we wouldnt have to worry about the fee. Real nice people.

2. Packages and mail have a good system. There isnt an email notification system like in the dorms, but the office leaves a note and a key in your mailbox to unlock a bigger box that holds your package (if its small enough, otherwise you pick it up inside the office). I check the mailbox regularly anyways, so it works well for me. Ive actually found that when the office is closed, UPS delivers straight to my apartment doorstep, which is pretty convenient.

3. The area is very quiet. I think I mightve read something that people wrote about this place being loud because its next to a daycare center. Though I do see those kids when Im biking out to campus, the noise doesnt really leak into my apartment. To be fair though, I live in the middle section of the complex. But other than that, the complex is really quiet most of the time.

4. Lots of study centers (with bathrooms inside). The study centers are nice places to go when you get tired of working at a desk. Im not sure if my fellow residents are naturally clean, or if janitors clean it up regularly. Either way, I dont see trash lying around the study buildings.

5. Plenty of laundry areas and machines. I usually dont have trouble doing laundry, as long as I dont procrastinate until Friday, or the weekend. Even during those days though, theres bound to be empty washing machines and dryers around the different laundry rooms.

6. Excellent maintenance. The microwave in my apartment broke, and I sent a request for it to be fixed. I think it was literally the next day that a bunch of guys knocked on the door and brought in a completely new microwave. That was pretty cool.

7. Good water pressure and temperature quickness. The water doesnt tinkle on you like those at the Ramble (According to another guys review). The sink has a powerful faucet, good for cleaning dishes. It usually doesnt take too long to get hot water either.

8. Free, high speed internet. The speed of the internet is good enough that you dont need comcast or any additional cable services. Im able to stream 720p videos on youtube without any trouble, Im not sure what other benchmarks would be useful. The MBPS fluctuates depending on how many people are using it, since it varies on the usage from people in the entire building. Ive never had trouble with internet disconnecting or anything like that.

9. Regular landscaping/grass cutting. This one isnt a big deal, and I dont know whether this is standard for apartments. I just like the fact that the grass is always nicely trimmed, and the leaves are routinely swept up during fall.

10. Excellent pricing (for me at least). I pay $316 a month to share a living room with another guy. The third roomate has the bedroom to himself. We have the normal 1x1 flat. ($316+$316+$438  $1070). Honestly I think this is a killer deal, but Im probably more space efficient than most people. I was worried that the management wouldnt like us cramming 3 people into a 1 bedroom apartment, but they gave us all room keys, and key cards. We only got 1 mailbox key, but I dont see that as much of a problem. We just keep it on the shelf in the living room.  Users/ElliotsYoung
