You will fear the colossus, I know I do!  I will get the nutritional values for it just because Im curious in a morbid way. This is an eating challenge, kinda like the Boss Hog from the Educated Eatery

The Burger contains from top to bottom:

      Bun usually sourdough, but it was regular this time
      Santa Fe sauce
      A grip of jalapeños
      Two slices of pepperjack cheese
      CrissCut French fries
      Two crispy chicken patties Mostly Bacon Swiss patty
      More jalapeños
      Onion
      Tomato
      Onion rings
      Two slices pepperjack cheese again
      BBQ and more Santa Fe sauce
      Bottom bun
