20070512 22:28:05 nbsp joey is so helpful, and doesnt not overcharge by any means. he provides immediate and free phone support, as well as house calls. he has saved one of my computers, and is working one another as I type. please call joey the genius!! he comes highly recommended!! Users/computerimpaired

20070901 21:47:49 nbsp A true Mensch. I called in desperation on a Friday night vanquished by the flimflammers at AT&T DSL service, and Joseph talked me down and talked me through it (helping me with real tech support that was immediately effective while on the phone) for about 30 minutes, refusing to accept payment for the help he gave me. The help resulted in my being able to get the internet up in spite of the tech service at AT&T which of course is why I can write this. I honestly was moved by the gentle straightforward and genuinely helpful conversation he had with me on the spot. I will use thecomputergenuis in all circumstances where I need tech help and cant do it myself. I am writing this review in both gratitude and to make others aware of his unique personable service in a field filled with con artists. Users/Kwicksotic

20070921 00:37:07 nbsp Oh my God, this guy is amazing.
He came over right away, recovered my data and got my computer working again. He explained everything he was doing and taught me how to fix the problem myself if it ever happened again. I dont know anything about computers so Ive used tech support services a lot, and Joseph is the best one Ive ever dealt with. Im so glad hes in Davis! Highly recommended!
(And I probably shouldnt say this, but I thought computer guys were all geeks but he is really cute and funny. If I didnt already have a boyfriend, Id try to date him!) Users/AlisonLamenoise

20071005 20:24:55 nbsp Update on Computer Genius...this time my puter crashed, ostensibly gone forever, all my family photos etc... Joseph came right over after a brief chat on the phone. Not only did he back up all my data onto his own portable storage device, but he diagnosed and fixed the problem. As Alison said (above) explaining everything he was doing, giving me brief tutorials where needed and endorsing a personally held view of doing business that reflects the best of what one might want from a community oriented and truly ethical business person. I dont know about you, but given how little I understand about computers I need someone who is trustworthy and nonjudgmental about providing helpful thorough service without over charging or manipulating for more money. Add to that the fact that he specifically states he is oncall 24/7 for his clients and I dont think you could ask for a better provider of this kind of service. Users/Kwicksotic

20071210 14:34:01 nbsp He was kind of late, but the fact that he comes to you is great and he really is a genius. Was in and out real quick and told me what I should do to fix my computer myself (cheaper than paying him to do it). Definitely going to call him for help again and would pay him to come out and help again without a second thought. Users/GrantSchoon

20080906 10:53:55 nbsp He seems affiliated with veteran and rotary groups, also his site is coded to work in internet explorer only.. for security reasons, this confuses me greatly. Joey the genius also promises that you can has a connection speed that is 375% your current celerity (three and three quarters faster, reference website at this date). Mm I would just wish people who commented here posted more of their other experiences in Davis, but then again, maybe they dont use computers much. Users/DavidPoole

20080906 10:59:15 nbsp The set of all things referencing the YoloSolano Computer Users Group can be found here.. and on Genius Joeys website, shenanigans?  Users/DavidPoole
   If he has a history as long as he claims, it could be a group that was active in the early 80s or such and has never been noted on the web.  User Groups used to be much more active before all computers arrived in a box ready to plug in.  Plenty of hobby and special interest groups I was involved in before the web existed have never wound up getting mentioned, and some were pretty large.  He has kind of the right vibe to be that kind of computer repair guy. jw

20080906 14:45:11 nbsp Wait, Im confused. You have awardwinning website designers, yet your site is the most amateur site Ive ever visited, and is coded for Microsoft Internet Explorer for security reasons? Woah woah woah.... my mind just got blown. That doesnt sound like a computer genius to me. Users/TimJ

20090320 11:29:44 nbsp Woa! Anyone who believes Internet Explorer is safe is not as competent as I thought. I would most likely have used his services had I not seen the site... Ew! Users/Marius

20090730 21:21:32 nbsp I called this guy and got a voicemail message that said his mailbox was full.  I emailed him and he did not respond after two weeks.  Does anyone know if he is still in business? Users/ZachStednick

20091205 07:32:51 nbsp 2009:   hes a nice guy, but reckless!  Charges WAY too much, isnt THAT helpful, works WAY too fast, so as not to waste your money, but isnt really high quality.  Loses his temper, curses, insults you, but in a light friendly way.  I dont buy it.   Users/skywords

20110917 15:36:32 nbsp Website design?? O.o  > http://thecomputergeniusonline.com Users/ScottMiller
  Hahahahaha!!!  The site speaks for itself.   Users/CovertProfessor
