The Cow Car is a largerthanlife classic car that is painted black and white and resembles a cow.  It seems to spend a lot of time around Cuarto.  Anybody else seen this wonder on wheels?

In 2012, a new cow car could be seen driving around Davis, adorably.

(See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dazzle_camouflage )  The goal of dazzle paint is to make it difficult to tell which way a vehicle is going, rather than to conceal its existence.  That seems like a bad idea with a car somehow...  Users/IDoNotExist
 Cars ! ships, you killjoy Daubert

Either way, the idea is the same.  If you cant tell which way a vehicle (ship or car) is going, its harder to avoid it. Users/IDoNotExist
