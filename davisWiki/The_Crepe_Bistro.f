The Crêpe Bistro was a great crepe restaurant that had pretty good fondue too and amazing French onion soup that Davisites lament about the lack thereof to this day. It was in the E Street Plaza business section, which suffered in a fire a few years back, temporarily closing most of the businesses in this block. The Crêpe Bistro was ultimately a victim of this blaze.

On each table was a wooden block printed on each of its tapered sides with the wiki:WikiPedia:Eiffel_Tower Eiffel tower. There was a hole in the top and on each of the sides. When you placed your order they would give you a flag to put on the tower.

The manager of The Crêpe Bistro now operates La Crêpe at the Silo, with the original owner as well!



20050826 21:00:14 nbsp For years this was my favorite place to eat in Davis. The crepes were very good. (far and away better than Crepeville) Almost any time I see a wiki:WikiPedia:Niçoise_Salad Niçoise salad on a menu I order it hoping for one like they used to serve here and have always been disappointed.
