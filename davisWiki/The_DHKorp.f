The DHKorp means Davis Helpers Korp but also stands for the main member of this small bussiness, Danny, Haley and Khang. We are 3 teenagers at the age of 1416. We decided to start a small summer business to help the community. Since we are teenagers our transportation is limited to mostly biking and walking.

We plan to help as many people in the Davis Community as we can, transportation depending. We would like to gain experience in the business field to get a feel for what life after or even during college would be like. We are a team of 3 main people and once in awhile will have help from friends.


What we can do:
 Technology help (too a certain extent)
 Housekeeping (interior and exterior) supplies are not provided by team
Summer house sitter (including pet sitting)
Car wash supplies not provided by team
running errands errands would be done by bike or walking
 Etc. please email to ask about other jobs



all jobs are finalized through email
