The Daily Show is a satirical news program that pokes fun at network news anchors, reports and politicians. It is hosted by Jon Stewart, who has appeared in several movies and television shows. Several news clips from CNN, CSPAN and FOX News are taken out of context and poked fun at in a humorous way.  The Daily Show uncovers several ridiculous factors of journalism with Daily Show correspondents conducting their own field stories.  Along with news stories that are similar to satirical bulletins seen on Saturday Nights Live Weekend Update are interviews with celebrities, political figures, activists, authors, musicians and other headliners.

In 2004, The Daily Show hosted an election special called Indecision 2004.  This special is now available on video and DVD.  Also spawned from The Daily Show is the bestselling America The Book.
