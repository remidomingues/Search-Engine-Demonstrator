The Davis Beat is a biweekly independent media newspaper founded at UC Davis in Winter Quarter 2013. It is a standard paper that focuses mainly on campus issues and strives for thorough and accurate reporting. The Davis Beat has no office space (which we are bitter about), nor is it the offshoot of any campus department or ASUCD. None of the staff is paid. To work at The Davis Beat, contact the managing editor at managing.davisbeat@gmail.com.
