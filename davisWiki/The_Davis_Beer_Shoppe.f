The Davis Beer Shoppe is a beer shop that offers by far the largest selection of premium quality beers in Davis.  While they only have 15 taps  1 nitro, 14 CO2  the beers on tap rotate very rapidly.  They added 6 new taps to the original 9 on August 9, 2012.  They also have more than 600 different bottled beers, many available already cold, that you can buy and pour right there in the tasting room.  Theres a $1 corkage fee for beers you want to enjoy in the tasting room  not too shabby, especially if youre getting 750ml bottles.  Theyll provide whatever glassware you might need.  The vast majority of beers sold are not available in most grocery or liquor stores.

For a while the Shoppe was the only place in town that pours 20ounce British pints (de Veres Irish Pub now also does 20 oz. pours).  There may be Bars That Serve HONEST PINTS a few places in town that serve 18oz. pours, which is still head and shoulders above the norm.  Pour size depends on the beer, and it is clearly listed on the menu.  If it says 16 oz., they give you a 20 oz. pour.  If it says 8 oz., they use a 12 oz. chalice (yes, they called it that before Stella Artois started their stupid new ad campaign).

Beers on tap typically range from $2 to $6 per pour, with prices actually tied to the wholesale cost of the beer.  This means that beers which dont cost the Shoppe much wont cost you too much, either.  Sierra Nevada Torpedo, for example, was $1.99 per pint (20 oz) in April 2012, which is less than many places charge for a bottle of domestic swill.  Of course, youll also typically find at least one or two fancy beers on tap thatll be $46 for a half pint (actually 12 oz).

They also do a daily themed tasting flight.  Themes vary widely.  For example, in the first half of September 2011, tasting flight themes included Stouts (9/14), Victory (the brewery) (9/13), Dubbels (9/12), Ryes (9/10), IPAs (9/9), Deutchland (9/6), Lagunitas (9/5), England (9/4), Last Days of Summer Beers (9/3), and EuroWheat (9/2).

Most flights consist of five 4ounce pours, although sometimes there are only 3ounce pours to keep the price reasonable.  Prices for the tasting flights are typically $510, although they occasionally go higher.  On Fathers Day 2011, there was a $15 tasting flight consisting of 3oz. pours of some absolutely extraordinary beers, including the $23/bottle 2009 Old Stock Reserve out of North Coast Brewery.

You can check both the tap list and the tasting flight (posted daily) on Shoppes https://www.facebook.com/pages/TheDavisBeerShoppe/137509982962321 Facebook page.

The Shoppe offers an early afternoon happy hour specials happy hour special from Sunday to Thursday, 11AM to 4PM. Pours are a dollar off during this time, meaning you can often get a quality craft beer for just a little over a buck or two.

Retail
The Shoppe has a spectacular retail section.  They typically have more than 600 different brews on hand of virtually every variety.  A handful of glutenfree beers are available, as well as typically 1012 varieties of cider.  They recently (summer 2011) added a small selection of sodas and energy drinks in the refrigerated section.  For a $1 corkage fee, you can drink any can or bottle off their shelf in their tasting room.  Sixpacks of the more common beers tend to be a bit pricier than at local grocery stores, but their larger bottles (bombers, 750mls, etc.) are usually comparable or cheaper than grocery store options.  They are one of very few places that allow you to split six packs, buying one or two beers out of a pack if you want.

In addition to cans and bottles, they sell some prepacked snack foods (pretzels, nuts, candies, mixes, and so on), a variety of glassware, a small selection of brewing and beer books, a couple of very basic brewing kits, and miscellaneous swag.  They do not currently sell beermaking ingredients, although that may change in the future.  The owner has indicated they plan on expanding food options and to offer pairings with certain beers. In the meantime, the Shoppe seems to have a very liberal policy of letting patrons bring outside food in and eat at the tables.

They also began supplying kegs in Summer 2011.  The selection is absolutely spectacularif its available in a keg in California, they can probably get it for you.  Note that they do abide strictly by breweries rules on sale of kegs for private use.  Oftentimes breweries prohibit the sale of hardtocomeby brews to commercial locations only so that more people get a taste.  Understandably, the Shoppe doesnt want to lose access to beer from those breweries, so they abide by those rules.  Turnaround time on a keg varies depending on the distributor.  Most distributors take orders from the Shoppe one day each week and deliver kegs either one or two days later, meaning total turnaround time ranges from 1 to 7 days.  A deposit is required for the keg (and presumably the tap, if you need one) if you dont have an empty keg shell to trade in.  The deposit is $30 for a sixth barrel keg (5.23 gallons).

They carry Daviss own BRÜBAR Energy Bars.

Space Issues
The Shoppe is a fairly small place with limited capacity.  Most Thursday and Friday evenings you can find a line outside the door waiting to get in because theyre at capacity.  Seating is limited, leaving only standing room in the tasting area even when the place isnt quite at capacity.  Some individual patrons are also in the habit of taking a whole table to themselves instead of sitting on a stool at the counter (or a barrel), even when the tasting room is super crowded.  Dont be that person when its busy  at least offer to share.  Employees have indicated they arent likely to be able to make any major changes to the layout in the near future, and the sidewalk there is unfortunately too narrow for outdoor seating.

The Shoppe is split into two distinct sections.  In the front is the tasting room with all of the seating.  You must be 21 years old to enter the tasting area, and open containers arent allowed outside of it, and the workers are strict about keeping drinkers in the drinkers area.  In the back is the retail area, where all ages are free to go.  Restrooms are available in the very back.  Because of the layout, its common to have a very crowded front portion of the store while only a handful of people are back browsing the retail.

Even when the shop is at capacity, they reserve a one spot for retailonly customers, so you are always able to grab beers to go.

20110321 12:28:54 nbsp Is it possible to order hard to find beers here? Ive been looking for Theakston Old Peculier for a long time, but have not been able to buy locally for a long time. Users/jsbmeb

20110321 19:51:14 nbsp Interesting and wellchosen tap list. Outstanding bottle selection.  If their goal was to try and bring something like San Franciscos City Beer Store to Davis, then Id say theyre off to a damn good start. Users/tnolte

20110322 20:07:11 nbsp Visited on a Monday night and was impressed with the selection of beers, many of which Id never heard of. Taylor and Kelly are very friendly and answered my
questions about different beers. I sat at a table with a friend and had a nonalcoholic beer that I really liked. People at another table brought in pizzas from
Woodstocks to munch on while they sampled beers. The only drawback is that seating is limited, but that could change.  Users/nowhereman

20110324 19:15:36 nbsp The selection of bottles for purchase is huge, and they have 8 rotating taps as well ton of bottles to consume in the store.  They also seem to do special flights from 5 pm to close last night I enjoyed a flight of 5 doppelbocks. Users/AlyssaOlenberg

20110325 22:35:14 nbsp Count me a fan after one visit. Enjoyed a lovely draft pint after spending too long staring at the litany of bottled riches; nice atmosphere, very cool and knowledgeable guys behind the taps. Had high hopes for one place to drink in Davis without televisions, but sadly looks as if nobody has the European courage to just say no to flatscreens... Users/Swilltopower

20110328 21:23:44 nbsp I agree, this place is great.  Good atmosphere, friendly people and awesome beer selection. Users/drdustin

20110330 12:03:18 nbsp Updated 8.18.11  Definitely good on selection and I love the integrated sitting area for drinking/socializing however the prices have gone up a bit I think.  A four pack of this craft brew I love, which runs 7.50 at the CoOp, was going to be 10 dollars here.  I wouldnt really notice a 50 cent difference, and would maybe grumble but pay a odllar more to support a new local business but paying 30% more I just couldnt do.  I dont think its everything but Im definitely going to be comparing prices a lot more when Im here.  Users/OliviaY

20110330 14:41:40 nbsp This is certainly my new favorite place in Davis. Their beer selection positively cannot be beat in Davis, and is certainly superior to even places like BevMo. If you dont like whats on tap, you can drink anything they sell at the shop, and they have around 70 (maybe more) beers in their fridge, ready to be opened. Whats even more surprising is that their prices are about the same as (or cheaper than!) anywhere else for a decent beer in Davis.

Bluntly, if youre a Budweiser/MGD/PBR type of person, this is not the place for you. If youre into Pyramid ales... youre getting closer, come try it out. If you like what most beer snobs would consider real beer, congratulations, youve found a slice of heaven in Davis.

The atmosphere is quite different than other lounge type places that serve alcohol. By my experience, good quality and more expensive beer does not appeal to most younger folks (it certainly didnt to me in my early 20s), and the crowd certainly reflects that. Furthermore, you must be 21 to enter the lounge area. Therefore, the crowd is generally filled with people in their late 20s and early 30s, which is quite abnormal for Davis.

Staff (and the owners, Kelly and Taylor) are extremely friendly and happy to offer suggestions.

Seating is quite limited (around 1520 seats), but counter space is sometimes used for tastings. I am told the place is pretty quiet and empty during the day, but after 5pm its generally full for the rest of the night.

They seem to be off to a great start. Honestly, Im just waiting to see what theyre going to do when (it doesnt seem like an if!) expand.

20110401 19:52:17 nbsp We finally checked this place out tonight.  I LOVE it!  Olivia, your Mammoth Double Nut Brown is already there and on tap (and delicious!  Thanks, I hadnt had it before).  They keep a really good variety on tap.  Tonight there was Lagunitas Pils, Stone CaliBelgique IPA (not the normal Stone IPA; apparently its a very hoppy trippel), Mammoth Double Nut Brown, a Duchesse sour (my first sour... and absolutely fantastic), and a couple others.  Very friendly staff, ready with recommendations.  They could use a hand stamp there, since we got carded a couple of times, but its still new.  A friend we met there said most of the beers had changed since his last visit, 3 days ago.  Damned impressive, not even counting the massive selection on the walls and in the fridges.  Prices for pints and halfpints (depending on the tap; the Duchesse, for example, was 8 oz) range from $2.99 (Lagunitas Pils, awesome price) to $4.99 (Duchesse 8oz. pour).  Theyll gladly give you tastes of a couple of beers to help you decide.

Seating is an issue.  We, like many others, were stuck standing for a while, although we got a table after a while.  Theres a lot of empty space, so they could easily put in a few more tables.  They could also redo the back of the place, to either put in a LOT more retail shelving, or add 45 tables.  Itd be nice if theyd rework it a bit.

Regardless, if you like good beer, go to The Davis Beer Shoppe, post haste!  You wont regret it. Users/TomGarberson

20110401 20:20:53 nbsp This place is incredible! Huge selection of beers including some very hardtofind ones. IT IS NOT A DIVEBAR! Do not expect adequate seating, you probably will not find it (until they inevitably expand). It is a very classy place to enjoy a beer or the wonderful sampler selections they have and still be able to hear the person sitting across from you at a table. If youre looking for a nonrowdy, nondive place to enjoy a drink from a vast selection with knowledgable and friendly servers, then this is the place. I will be coming again in the future.  Users/Chronoz

20110401 22:52:39 nbsp Great idea for a davis business, competitive prices and a pretty solid selection. I hope they will expand so I can take friends here at night and not have to worry about finding a table.  Users/MMAC

20110405 16:18:19 nbsp The best beer selection in davis on tap and on the menu. The prices are not bad either for the quality beer also! I just hope they keep their prices, i literally want to try all their beer on their menu. and they have sample beer for like 5 dollars! Users/beerlover

20110407 10:04:42 nbsp I was floored by how hopping this place was on a Tuesday night. I just wrote a blog review last night if you want to check it out. ( http://nblo.gs/gn6wm ) Lucky for me, the tasting flight included 5 Imperial IPAs , YAY! Great choices, that certainly demonstrated how the same style can be interpreted so differently by producers. I only wish that they had put a teensy bit more thought into the tasting order and maybe specified go left to right. We all started with Stones Ruination and it basically ruined our palates. (LOVED it though) This is officially my favorite new hang out in Davis.  Users/MadisonSmith

20110414 11:07:17 nbsp Went here last night with my S/O for the first time and we really enjoyed ourselves.  Outstanding selection in the store area and the tasting room was a real treat.  2 Lost Abbey selections on tap is hard to beat.  Im looking forward to all future visits.
 Users/B.Egan

20110414 14:38:52 nbsp This place is simply quite awesome.  Nice atmosphere, great selection, and helpful staff.  I think beer tastes better when it is poured by a barrel chested man with a large red beard in a paisley tie. Unfortunately it is often too busy in here for my comfort. Users/DagonJones

20110415 13:45:23 nbsp If you dont know your beers all that well, be prepared to ask how strong they are before buying one. I tried an IPA last week which was somewhat stronger than I was expecting. Later on I discovered it was >9% alcohol. It would be great if they added the alcohol content to the blackboard behind the bar.  Users/KeithBradnam

20110423 20:51:01 nbsp any decent beer has about 810% alc :)

I became a fan of US beer with The Great Divide  Great mind drink alike. Before that it was mostly only Blue Chimay that fit my view on what a great beer is (being more of a wine drinker). Do they have The Great Divide beers there? Hibernation ale and Hercules IPA?
Im very surprised they are more readily available in denmark than here.

20110426 21:02:06 nbsp I visited for the first time yesterday to try a flight of the premium sours. Im not typically a beer fan but after tasting a few sours at CLips of Faith last summer I was hooked. It cost $9.95 for a flight (plus tax and tip) which seemed high (at least to me), but was I guess it was pretty fair given how long sours take to brew. Note: If youre tasting with friends, be aware that no more than three flights will fit on top of one of those barrel tables.

As for the premium sour lineup, the La Roja was by far the least favorite of everybody at the table, and it seemed out of place in the tasting order. The New Belgium La Folie was my favorite, but it would have been nice if they had La Terroir in the flight for comparison. Im not sure if they left it out because they wanted to include five different brewers, or because La Terroir is not as expensive (maybe doesnt count as premium?), but if you like sours Id recommend it.

My main suggestion for this place is they get some pub food, stat. Even if they just have ONE menu item, like french fries or potato skins, that would be great. I was pretty buzzed for at least 90 minutes after I left, and I didnt even drink the whole flight. Granted I am pretty small, but the two guys I was with felt the same way. An appetizer to slow the absorption of alcohol would have been perfect, in my opinion. Or if they dont want to cook, maybe they could have some sort of deal with Woodstocks next door.

20110519 16:10:23 nbsp I visited Davis Picnic Day and came here for my first beer of the day. The wait to get in was worth it and once I got in I thought I died and went to beer heaven. The place had about 8 beers on tap from breweries I never heard of and 3 wall shelves of beer and other alcohol. Fortunately the staff allowed me to sample some of the beer on tap before I got a pint. I had the Mango IPA and Allagash Black beer. Both were excellent and I hope to come back here next time to see what new beers they have. Users/SimonFung

20110724 22:49:01 nbsp Davis really needed a bar that serves high quality and rare beer. Im quite happy you all opened up and have really enjoyed the brew and the bartenders service. Id like to offer some suggestions for improvement, primarily about atmosphere:
  The shop is quite bright after dark due to the beer store part. Id suggest dimming the lights or somehow visually blocking the light from the store part from reaching the seating area.
  Ditch the TVs. Cant we have at least one good bar with out a TV running in the background? People come to a shop like this for the beer and the company, not to watch TV.
  Add more seating and capacity. It is very annoying that the Beer Shoppe is the only bar downtown that turns people away. I assume that the combo shop and bar create some kind of limit on the amount of people that can come in. Id recommend utilizing the wasted floor space in the shop area for seating. The shop area could be smaller and the bar larger with lots more cozy seating. A long bar along the North wall would really be great.
  Setup some outdoor seating if at all possible. Ask the city to git rid of the car parking spots in front so you can have a nice outdoor seating area.
Keep up the good work, I hope that your shop becomes a mainstay hear in Davis. Users/JasonMoore

20110730 08:22:03 nbsp Excellent selection for a town such as Davis. The staff, while pleasant and attentive, are not as engaging as they should be. See the above criticisms as to the layout of the store, they are all valid. One hopes they will expand to a new location in the next 69 months. Serving food beyond fixed pairings would be a mistake, especially fried bar food and the like; try the Grad down the street. The store does tend to get populated with the hipster and intelligentsia crowd in the evenings, which can be a bit insufferable. Comparing the location to a theme park is a bit of an eyeroller, but it does provide an excellent tasting resource for the aficionado or homebrewer. Im looking forward to watching the location evolve. Users/AlexShenko

20110818 00:30:15 nbsp I liked the Davis Beer Shoppe page on Facebook, which was both a terrible and great decision. They post the current beers on tap, as well as the daily tastings, everyday  which is fantastic, because I want to go everyday now. Its only terrible because I dont have any money to do that. Users/ChristyMarsden

20110818 00:47:10 nbsp Good beers at tolerable prices. Agree with complaints about the layout. Seems like theyre leaving a lot of money on the table by dedicating so much space to off premise sales. I suppose they are creating an exclusive atmosphere by keeping the seating artificially limited. Users/MikeyCrews

20110818 04:35:31 nbsp The next time I revisit my old haunts in the dirty thirty this will be one of my first stops, so as to cure my thirst of curiosity in the changes within the Little Tomato (as well as other thirsts). Any chance you guys could import some http://www.brewdog.com/ Brewdog from the UK? Users/RobRoy

20110908 11:29:51 nbsp Big fan after one visit too. Amazing selection on tap an in bottles, great, lofi snacks, casual atmosphere and great service from the bearded dudes running the place. My only complaint is the light brightness could be lowered a bit and the tvs were distracting for conversation. Will definitely go back! Users/vrussell

20110916 11:46:13 nbsp The Beer Shoppe is an amazing establishment. Yes, it is hard to find a seat, but I would rather be turned away from a full establishment that is well run with great beer selection, than find an open seat at a poorly run establishment with crap beer. Every time I get turned away I am disappointed, but it makes me want to go back and check later that night, or get there earlier on another day  which I truly have no problem with. This is all because basically they have (no argument) the best beer selection in Davis. Most of the full time guys (I say this because they are there a lot) are incredibly friendly, knowledgeable about the beer, and are always willing to have a conversation. Some individuals working there are more timid to have a conversation, but then again Im not there to talk to them usually. I would be upset if they made this place easier to sit in, or made any changes at all.  Users/BenedictIV

20111004 15:32:18 nbsp This place is the shit. If they dont have what youre looking for you should ask the dudes behind the counter. I was looking for some De Dolle beers a while back, told the guy, he said hed look into it, a few weeks later they were on the shelf. Totally killer. Users/TheRadish

20111031 13:21:29 nbsp Cool place, awesome idea. For those of you going for the first time apparently they will chill your beer for you, you have to ask them though. I was told they would ask you when you pay and then was disapointed to receive a warm beer. Just FYI. Users/jadeeyes1113

20111108 21:32:11 nbsp Fantastic selection of Russian River.  No Pliny, but enough Consecration to burn a hole in your wallet.  Great atmosphere if youre looking for a more mature drunk crowd in the evening. Users/miguelsantiago
