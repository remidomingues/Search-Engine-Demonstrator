On June 1, 2012, The Davis Dirt hosted the first ever Street Food Rodeo  a roundup of the best street food vendors from our area. Davisites are craving innovative, fresh & affordable street food, and The Dirt is answering their call. With food trucks, live music, face painting, hay bale seating, and free admission, whats not to love! Plus, this event is also a fundraiser with proceeds going to the Davis School Garden Program  helping kids stay in touch with where real food comes from.

A whole lot of people came out on June 1st! (Hundreds attended.) YeeeHa!!!

On September 21, The Davis Dirt hosted its second Street Food Rodeo with over 2,500 people in attendance! With more food, more music, more performers, and more haybales, the food vendors could not handle so much excitement. They ran out of food pretty early! This event also raised $1000 for the Davis School Garden Program.
