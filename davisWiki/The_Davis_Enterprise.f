The Davis Enterprise is the generalcirculation Media newspaper of Davis, published on Tuesdays through Fridays and Sundays, excluding major holidays.  (The Enterprise ceased Monday publication in 2009).  It is also the official legal newspaper for the City of Davis and of Yolo County. The Enterprise has a larger circulation base than The California Aggie, even though The Aggie is free whereas the Enterprise is not. Of course the Aggie targets UCD students, whereas the Enterprise is for the general public. The Davis Enterprise is a member of the http://www.cnpa.com California Newspaper Publishers Association. The Enterprise was established in 1897 by L. A. Eichler, with the first paper being printed on Jan. 1st, 1898. The Davis Enterprise is property of McNaughton Newspapers, which also owns several other papers in the area.

The Enterprise is printed at 302 G Street at 8:30am Tuesday through Friday and delivered by 5pm weekday evenings. Sunday publications are printed up to midnight Saturdays and delivered by 7am Sunday morning. Carriers are independent contractors and are paid per newspaper delivered actual payment per paper may vary based on where the route is located, how large the route is and carrier performance. Routes are available to persons 12 years and older. If you wish to become a carrier, call (530)7560826. Unlike the public perception of newspaper boys, many carriers are adults with cars. Users/NickSchmalenberger I was a paper carrier for 3 years as a teenager and delivering papers on Sunday mornings in the rain was very beautiful and amazing. I was usually still late though.  If you are unhappy with your carrier or have delivery problems, contact (530) 7560826.

Some people call it the Emptyprise because of the filler articles from services like wiki:WikiPedia:Cox News Service about home improvement and other topics complementary to their advertisements. They also run many more real news articles from the wiki:WikiPedia:Associated Press that have nothing to do with Davis but might be of interest to someone who only takes the Enterprise. Maybe there isnt really enough news in Davis to support 6 or 7 issues weekly, but too much for just weekly or even thrice weekly so some filler is necessary just for that. The elimination of wiki:WikiPedia:Mary Worth also contributes to the feeling of emptiness. Some believe they run stories which suggest an antistudent bias (especially concerning Parties parties) and the Enterprise is sometimes accused of failing to balance these antistudent pieces with student perspectives. It would be interesting if such critics could cite any examples of this purported bias. The Enterprise emphasizes coverage of local news, sports, features and entertainment.

Its coverage of community and high school sports is unmatched. In 2008, the Davis Enterprise was awarded 2nd place in the General Excellence Category for Best Newspapers in California with a circulation of 10,000 to 25,000 presented by the California Newspapers Publishers Association. The award for first place was won by another McNaughton Newspaper, The Daily Republic, in Fairfield, CA.  In 2010, the Enterprise won first place in the General Excellence category, plus 18 awards in categories such as editorial pages, writing, and feature stories  the most of any newspaper in California. In 2011, The Enterprise was once again chosen for first place in General Excellence, and now known as Californias Best Small Newspaper.  Enterprise submissions for the 2012 awards have been submitted.


They also publish Davis Direct, a TMC (total market coverage) Junk Mail alladvertising publication delivered weekly to nonsubscribers. This publication includes the weekly entertainment pages and classifieds as well as insert advertising as scheduled. At least its free.

Layout and format: Two standard sections; the main section and the sports section, which includes the classifieds. Friday includes an automotive section.

The Davis Enterprise website has a complete ban on all search engines accessing any part of their site (see their wiki:WikiPedia:Robots exclusion standard exclusion file http://www.davisenterprise.com/robots.txt here), (as of 16 Nov 2011, only one bot is specifically banned, all others (including Google and Yahoo) are allowed) so you cant even use http://archive.org to find older articles.

All daily stories appear online on, or often before, the date they publish in print. All classified ads and special sections are viewable to any reader, anytime no subscription or login needed.

The current physical address of the Davis Enterprise was formerly held by the post office.

 Accessing the Enterprise 


Other than actually subscribing to the paper or buying one at a newsstand, there are several cheaper and equally legitimate options.

They provide limited access to current articles and archives over the last year at their website, http://www.davisenterprise.com/.  It is not clear how they determine which articles are freely available and which are not.  You can pay to see articles that are not available for free in one of the following ways:  Day Pass – $.99, Monthly Online Pass – $6.99, or Monthly Online & Print Pass – $12.00 (prices correct as of February 2013).

The Enterprise is also archived on http://www.newsbank.com Newsbank.  Many libraries and institutions have paid Newsbank accounts and the Yolo County Library has a link from their http://www.yolocounty.org/index.aspx?page1268 online database page allowing access to the Enterprise and the Sacramento Bee, among other sources. Only a library card number is necessary to login outside of the library, and inside the library login is not necessary at all.  UC Davis also http://www.lib.ucdavis.edu/dept/govinfo/newspaper/davis.php has a Newsbank account and similar access is available from most UC Davis computers.

Both Shields Library and the Davis Branch Library have microfiche of the Enterprise going back to the beginning.

The mobile version of their site allows full access without having to pay or subscribe. You also do not have to subscribe to access any story posted on their http://www.facebook.com/TheDavisEnterprise Facebook Page.

 History 


In February 2011, the Davis Enterprise unveiled new improvements to their website.  The site was opened up to nonsubscribers with archives dating back a year for free.

Prior to this, web access to the paper was limited only to subscribers.  Nonsubscribers were allowed free access only on Mondays.  Links to the online articles were also not possible, eliminating facebook links to articles or citations on Daviswiki, etc.

Three months later, in May 2011, the enterprise slapped a paywall back on their website, limiting nonsubscribers to a few articles for free.  After that its $0.99 for a days use, or $2.99 for a week.  :(

 Printing Press 
The building that houses the Enterprise business offices was once the downtown Post Office post office before the post office moved to 5th St. Fifth and Pole Line Road Pole Line.

The Davis Enterprise maintains its own printing press, which prints several other papers, including Winters Express and the Placerville http://www.mtdemocrat.com/ Mountain Democrat, the oldest newspaper in California. Various student publications are also printed, including The California Aggie, King Hall Advocate, Davis Senior High Schools The HUB, and virtually all AS PAPERs. It is physically located across the street from the business office. Before the press existed on the lot, a dry cleaners stood on the property. Many of the hazardous chemicals used were simply dumped into the ground here, so testing still takes place to ensure the ground isnt overcome with chemical remnants should any still exist in the spot.

This building was the second location of the Enterprise, which is why until recently it said Davis Enterprise on the outside.

20041129 02:44:17 nbsp I think there is generally a great divide between Davis students and the population of Davis.  A lot of this is reflected in the http://californiaaggie.ucdavis.edu/article/?id6529 apathy of UCD students, even as regards campus issues, let alone local issues.  If students all registered to vote in Davis, they could literally dominate the city counsel and make the city awesome for students.  But apathy reigns supreme.  Any thoughts?  Users/JaimeRaba

20041129 05:33:58 nbsp I think that students should participate more in local politics.  However, nearly all of the undergraduates in Davis will Stay In Davis flee upon graduation.  Local politics affect them for only so long, whereas residents have to see the longterm affects of city matters.  I think that sometimes folks forget that Davis would be nothing without the Campus and the students in it. .  Users/PhilipNeustrom

20041211 18:51:32 nbsp Quite a few in Davis proper refer to this as the Emptyprize. Locals usually get their regular news from the Sac Bee, and merely check the Enterprise for local politics, obituaries, and wedding announcements. Now, as to the discussion so far: without UCD Davis would be what it is fast becoming anyway: a bedroom community for Sac and the Bay Area, and highly unaffordable for most people, including recent graduates.  Users/CentralDavisite

20041211 23:27:25 nbsp Yeah, but the theatre reviews are terrific.  (in my purely unbiased opinion, of course)  Users/BevSykes

20050319 21:15:33 nbsp Im just going to say that they should have stuck with their old masthead because the new one makes their website look completly unofficial and all around bad.  and as matty said, its all lowercase! I was going to change it on here but Im not even sure the one on the website is the same as the one on the paper (besides the obvious .com).Users/KristenBirdsall

20050420 02:51:15 nbsp To Central Davisite: Dixon was favored over Davis originally for the new UC campus, but Dixon locals were shortsighted and opposed it, and now they pretend like they dont regret it.  But if the D in UCD stood for Dixon, Davis would be like Dixon, and maybe you would be a Central Dixonite instead.  But its the way that it is, and every Davisite that hates young people and their buzzy modded Honda Civics can thank those youngsters that the CBD in Davis is actually vibrant.  Which would you rather have?  Downtown Dixon boasts six restaurants; ours has over 50. Users/RickEle

  Dixon was never favored over Davis in the competition to host the University Farm. I dont know what your source is for that myth. The history of how UC came to Davis is well told in John Loflands book, Davis: Radical Changes, Deep Constants. Users/RichRifkin

20050420 12:44:00 nbsp Quite a few towns competed for the honor of hosting the University Farm. That still isnt my main point. As it is, Dixon is rapidly becoming a bedroom community too. There are quite a few places in the Sacto metro area that dont have a university, yet they are becoming bedroom communities, and increasingly unaffordable which was my central point. Another local town that was a strong favorite for the ag division of Cal was Woodland, although you probably already knew that. As for comparing Dixon and Davis, I beg to disagree I think without the university, Davis would have ended up a bit more like Winters or Woodland. The rail line made a big difference compared with towns that didnt have rail access.  Users/CentralDavisite

I recommend that the newspaper have more than one movie reviewer. The current reporter has a limited scope of genres he tolerates. The newspaper needs another reporter who can cover all the other kinds of movies. The current movie reviewer is also the arts editor, though he seems to have limited knowledge, interest, and experience as an audience member in our local art, theater, and music scene. Users/NoelBruening

20060223 17:34:22 nbsp apparently they print my high schools newspaper. why them and not vacavilles own newspaper, we may never know... Users/MichelleAccurso

20060923 12:15:02 nbsp The Enterprises editorial content is controlled by Davis real estate interestsproperty managers and real estate brokers.   The paper doesnt print stories about the recent decline in Davis housing market.   Home prices and rents are falling.  Theyre ignoring the biggest local news story in town.   For local high school sports scores I read the Enterprise.   For objective reporting about whats really happening in Davis I read the Sacramento Bee.   Users/SteveGreen

20061024 17:51:44 nbsp I used the think the enterprise was awesome and then my dad rocked my world and pointed out the inherent bias as touched upon in the comment above. Ever since then I have viewed it in a new light Users/StevenDaubert

20061211 12:01:33 nbsp The Enterprise represents a narrowly provincial clique of business interests and political coffee clubs.  Users/TomFrendl

20070501 18:29:00 nbsp Anyone know how to keep these guys from delivering to your house?  The pile of papers sitting in my driveway doesnt seem to make an impression on them that Im not interested in getting it...  Seems to me theres a lot of the same feeling by neighbors of mine whose driveways are littered with numerous papers of theirs... Users/HollywoOd
  If theyre delivering the paid edition, just call them and theyll stop. More likely, youre seeing the free Davis Direct rag. I see them pile up and then turn to mush if/when it rains. So sorry: I believe that, as a consumer, youre going to get this whether you use it or not. Users/DougWalter

20070731 19:39:48 nbsp This paper has the most boring and least entertaining film reviews Ive ever read.  Users/JoshFernandez

20080220 11:22:17 nbsp The Enterprise now requires a paid subscription for full online access to its content (which was free until a week ago). Nonsubscribers can only view content as a bulky .pdf document.

There was little reason to read the Enterprise in the first place, since their local news coverage is so thin  and the rest of the content is AP stories. Now theres no reason at all. Total bummer and bad move. Theyve alienated what little readership they had left. Users/MupDup
 Yes, the Enterprise website is now more broken than it has ever been. Being able to read a story by clicking on the headline on the homepage is really basic, get with it Emptyprise.  Users/NickSchmalenberger

20080408 20:44:10 nbsp We used to like this local paper but decided to boycott it after constant solicitations by their sales people, and especially after one of their sales people claimed to be a gang member and threatened a lady in our neighborhood after he was asked to leave her yard.  We wont support any business that employs that kind of trash in this community.  Any company that cares about their standing in a community will be selective when hiring its representatives.  I have learned that this paper could not care less, they need to clean it up in a hurry. Users/J.P.
  I wonder if this person was actually associated with the Enterprise.  Its a pretty common scam to be claiming to sell subscriptions to a newspaper, only to pocket the money.   Users/CovertProfessor

20090102 20:13:26 nbsp I dont know if its more sad than maddening that more honest, indepth local Davis news is reported by the Sac Bee than the Enterprise. Users/condemned2bfree

20090214 17:10:13 nbsp Wow, everybody dogpiling the small town newspaper!  It seems pretty unfair to compare the Enterprise, with a circulation of probably a few thousand, to a paper like the SacBee, which probably has a circulation of a few hundred thousand, and more resources available to it. Users/DukeMcAdow

20090216 21:51:35 nbsp If you want to know whats going on in Davis  everything from local politics to sports to local events to UCD to the downtown  you read the Enterprise.  I dont think theres any other way to get that much information about Davis, and honestly, I dont think Id feel comfortable living in a place without knowing whats going on around me.  Some people think the Sac Bees coverage of Davis is more extensive, but I dont see it.  If you want an alternate perspective, theres always the The Peoples Vanguard of Davis, which doesnt hesitate to criticize (or, occasionally, have positive words for) the Enterprise.  Some downsides to the paper  when theres not much (of interest) going on, its a rather quick read; Ive been known to read three or four in a sitting when I get behind.  They seem to have an overly generous Letters to the Editor policy; they will print letter after letter from the same person, or let an extended he said, she said dialogue go on between two people, and often, the letters are just really crappy (as compared to, e.g., the letters in the SF Chronicle).  I wish there were more Debra Lo Guercio and less Bob Dunning.  Sometimes the stories are just so small town I have to laugh  someone stole my bicycle, a duck fell down a sewer drain... All in all, its an OK paper.  It could be better, but so could a lot of things. Users/CovertProfessor
 If you want to read more Debra, then try the Winters Express, she is the editor. I also think she is a much better one than Debbie Davis who tends to be just a business booster and not want to offend. Debra, on the other hand is not afraid to have a strong editorial position on politics that dont directly affect the paper, and I think that plus the fewer editions make it much better quality. Hopefully the Enterprise will improve with fewer editions now also. If you want to subscribe to the Express in Davis, the Enterprise will deliver it to you. Users/NickSchmalenberger
  Ack, more to read!  Ok, thanks for the suggestion.  Their website was down when I checked, but Ill try it again later.   Users/CovertProfessor

20090413 18:28:23 nbsp horrible delivery man, lets his three year old throw the papers and he pays no attention to whether he missed one or not Users/Churro615

20090923 09:03:07 nbsp Davis Enterprise had an article titled If you want more indepth knowledge of the city, UC Davis or the surrounding areas, you might want to check out the following resources:  on the 21st of September, 2009 (see Newsbank).  Can anyone guess what incredible resource was curiously missing?  Users/RyanMikulovsky

20091109 13:51:38 nbsp I really have to wonder if loss of ad revenue is really worth closing down the site so much.  I can think of many times I needed something on the ER but instead had to resort to newspaper databases and not give them any impressions or click throughs.  Granted the odds Ill click on an ad are astronomical unless I happen to be in the market for whatever popped up.  Anyway, their loss, not mine save for a sliver of time. Users/RyanMikulovsky

20100120 21:57:59 nbsp Yes I wish the site doesnt charge for access  I personally dont mind a little more ads just so we could access the daily paper for free like the other online paper. Luckily the Yolo County Library online offers free access to newspapers in CA, but its not as updated as the main Enterprise site of course.  Users/LeeY

20110125 19:04:39 nbsp I have been dissapointed that I only get a newspaper 80% of the time, and when we do get it the newspaper is out of sight, has food or drink spilled on it, and it is usually in the street. A few times the delivery man let his three year old daughter throw the newpapers (I have seen it). I wish the delivery guy was better.... Users/Churro615

   Yes. Users/DonShor
   Search me, Tom. Perhaps you could give em a call and ask? Users/BrianOrr
   I dont get it.  They made a big todo about the new, open site.  And theyve barely given it a chance.  Of course, not a peep about this change in todays paper, at least not that I can see.   Users/CovertProfessor

20120320 20:54:31 nbsp This afternoon a deliverywoman for what Im assuming was the Enterprise (are there any other afternoon delivery smallish local newspapers?) pulled some interesting shenanigans in the parking lot of Saratoga West.  She drove through, slowly, thankfully, with her son (Im assuming) sitting on the hood of her car, handing newspapers out the drivers window so her son could try to throw them halfway across the parking lot, over the covered parking roofs, onto the balconies of subscribers.  At least, I hope they were subscribers.  In his defense, the kid had a great arm.  Still, that kinda crazy stuff.  When I was in high school a kid in the class behind me fell off the hood of a car, her head, and died.  If you want to do that kind of stuff on your own time, I guess thats your call.  But on the companys time, in a place where youre more or less constantly passing by either current or potential customers?  Probably not the best call. Users/TomGarberson

20120609 10:02:39 nbsp There are many great artists around Davis. However, I noticed that Enterprise is still using mainstream cartoons, like Garfield and Peanuts. Maybe we can allow a chance for local artists, especially students, to display their witty and colorful ideas.I particullarly know a young high schooler who has never been in an art class, but plans to take a few in the future, and has an excellent idea for a cartoon.

20130116 16:46:10 nbsp The elimination of Mary Worth also contributes to the feeling of emptiness.  I might be too young to understand the value of this Mary Worth comics strip, but is there actually a decent number of people who really care that it no longer runs in the Davis Enterprise?  I am genuinely asking? Users/AaronWedra

20130125 06:55:41 nbsp Does anyone have information about some juniorhighesh aged boys working for them? My husband and I have had some boys who look about 12 or 13 banging on our door late at night literally begging us to subscribe. Saying they were pushy would be an understatement. I had a funny feeling about them so I called the Davis police. They said just to ask for their sellers permit. Anyone else have this happen?  Users/jenb
  The Davis Municipal Code (28.01.120 (b)) prohibits soliciting between 8:00 PM and 8:00 AM.
 They have also come to my door and they are really pushy. I even had one look into the house behind me and ask me questions about my pets. Next time I will ask for their sellers permit, but honestly I dont think the Enterprise should be sending solicitors door to door at all. It makes me even less inclined to pay for website access. Megan
    My guess is that this is a scam and that these sellers are not associated with the Enterprise in any way.   Users/CovertProfessor
