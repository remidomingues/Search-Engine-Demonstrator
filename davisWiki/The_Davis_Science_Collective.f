The Davis Science Collective is a group of UC Davis graduate students that works with the Davis community on all things sciencerelated. We are a diverse group of scientists from various graduate programs, including Population Biology, Ecology, Entomology, and Molecular Biology. Our main goal is to help facilitate communication and interactions with community members of all ages.

History of the DSC

In 2011, a group of Population Biology graduate students at UC Davis started a science book club called The Big Read. We partnered with the Yolo County Public Library in the hopes of interacting with a large group of local science readers. Our first year — reading Misha Angrist’s Here is a Human Being – was a success, since we had the author himself come visit. However, in the years since, we’ve realized that many library patrons simply don’t have the time to come out for a weeknight book discussion. Along the way, we also discovered that visitors to the Davis Public Library love to stop and chat about science as they frequent the library on Saturdays and Sundays. So in the past couple months, we’ve shifted our group’s focus. We’re no longer a book club, but rather we are an outreach group whose mission is to casually interact with community members on a regular basis to discuss all things science related!
