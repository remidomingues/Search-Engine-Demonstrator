The Davis Shoppers Guide is a monthly Discounts and Freebies coupon publication. It has been riding the Post Office mail delivery trucks since 1983 (Note: elsewhere they say they started in 1984). In addition to the coupons, the top of each page of the mailing contains trivia questions (woo hoo!). Their web site has the same coupons online, these are printable and can be used just like the ones in the mailing. This page is updated once again, and you can enjoy all the coupon clippings you like online!   Just click and print. :)
