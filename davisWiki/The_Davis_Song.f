The Davis Song by Full House

16 miles from wiki:sacramento:Front Page Sacramento, heading west on Interstate 80 80.
You will find an oasis where Shadiness Factor avenues are shady.
Laid out on a Navigating Davis grid of alphabets and ordinal numbers,
Youll find merchants selling pizza, Car Dealerships cars, Supermarkets & Grocery Stores groceries and Hibbert Lumber lumACE Hardware ber.

People Folks go Bicycling pedling to and fro, to Bike Commute Month work, to Shopping Centers shop, to Schools classes.
Others sit and chat at cafes, clinking icechilled glasses.
Some would rather Running jog about, or do some Public Skate Park skateboard jive.
Yes I guess, I really must admit, some people Unique Vehicles drive.

The city I sing of is DAVIS.
Its the place the UC Regents gave us,
Over hundred Summer in Davis summers are the norm I better warn ya.
UCD Alphabet Soup DAVIS CA spells Davis California.

UC Davis Aggies, Bicycles bikes, tomatoes, Picnic Day, The Greenbelt green belts and School of Veterinary Medicine vet school,
Davis Farmers Market Farmers Market and the Rec Pool
Amtrak stops here umpteen times a day,
Davis Wish List What more could a person ask for, Wanted Pages what more can I say? Oh!

Putah Creek Putah Creek, the Arboretum Arboreetum, Central Park Central Park, you just cant beat um.
Solar Power Solar homes and a Train Tracks sloooow freight train through town,
FAQ I dont understand how any one can I Hate Davis put it down.

The city I Music Scene sing of is DAVIS. Where the M.I.N.D. Institute peace of mind I crave is
If I ever Moving Day move I know Im Leaving Davis gonna mourn ya,
UCD Alphabet Soup DAVIS CA spells Davis California
Some may claim were in the sticks...please write ZIP Codes 95616
....And now that we are I Love Davis oh so great, weâ€™ve added ZIP Codes 95618.

I Wish I Was a TV  the Bside of the Davis Song 7

This is an amazing song

Highlights:

Turn on your screens now... human beans now.
Turn on your screens now... human beans now.
Turn on your screens now... human beans now.

...

I want to be your T.V.
So that youd listen to me.
I want to be your T.V.
So that you would pay attention, pay attention.
