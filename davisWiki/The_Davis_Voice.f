The Davis Voice was a Locally Owned Websites local news, events and opinion blog written by several local writers.  Heres a farewell from their http://www.facebook.com/davisvoice Facebook page, posted July 25, 2012:
 Thank you to everyone in the Davis community who has supported this experiment in modern communications. Since January 2008, we have had varied success with publishing timely and newsworthy accounts about allthingsDavis. And now, July 2012, the original owners and editors have decided that it is time to conclude the experiment.

Although they mention plans to continue in some capacity, there was little activity by 2010, and are no 2013 or later postings of note on Facebook or the main site.

Their goal was to be a venue that honors civility and fairness, and promotes thoughtful dialogue and commentary about the joys of being a Davisite.  The blog covers City Council and School board meetings, local organizations and events, and provides coverage of local political issues.  Every Monday, the website has a regular feature called This Week in YOUR Government (subcategorized as Show Up or Stop Whining) that lists all of the city, DJUSD, county and some state public meetings.  Every Friday, readers can find the blogs picks for weekend entertainment in the regular feature called This Weekend in The Peoples Republic.
