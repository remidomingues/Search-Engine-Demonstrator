The (Western Pacific) Depot is a gay bar located on the corner of 20th and K Street, directly across from Faces. They have 30+ TV screens for sports and music videos, an enclosed patio in the back (where you can smoke), and a pool table. They have up to 4 bartenders on Friday and Saturday nights. Everyone usually floods the front bar, so try heading to the back to get your drinks. On Wednesday nights they have a pretty popular pop culture trivia quiz.

Drinks are pulled off the floor around 1:45 AM. (Its illegal to have booze on the floor past 2 AM in Sacramento.) But they stay open until 4 AM on Fridays and Saturdays to serve nonalcoholic beverages.
