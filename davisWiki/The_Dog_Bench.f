The Dog Benches Bench sits on the east side of the Sunken Garden which is the proper name for the garden within Shields Library. It was created in 2000 by Roy De Forest.

This sculpture is kind of disturbing if you think about it, as the bench juts out of the sides of the dogs...makes me think of a fistulated cow Users/MatthewTom

There is a similar sculpture in the childrens section of the Yolo County Library, except it is a table which appears to completely cut the dog in half. Users/KyleRocks
