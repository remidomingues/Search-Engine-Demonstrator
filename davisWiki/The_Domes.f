The Domes, (AKA Baggins End Innovative Housing), is an oncampus cooperative housing Cooperative housing community designed by Ron Swenson. Consisting of 14 polyurethaneinsulated fiberglass domes located in the Sustainable Research Area at the western end of Orchard Road, it is home to 26 UCD students. It is one of the only student cohousing cooperative communities in the USA, and is an early example of the modernday growing Tiny House/Small House Movement.  After a brief closure in the Fall of 2011, a lease between UCD and Solar Community Housing Association was signed. After renovations, in January of 2012, new residents moved back in http://www.davisenterprise.com/localnews/ucd/domehomestakeonresidentspersonality/.  Come by soon and check them out for yourself.


Domes Facts
  Established: 1972
  Number of residents per dome: 2
  Number of domes: 13 residential domes, 1 office dome (numbered 215Footnote(Dome 1 was originally designed with a wooden pad, but the university did not consider it an acceptable foundation material.  The pad temporarily housed an office during the build.  Ultimately, there was not enough money to complete Dome 1 and the Domes are numbered accordingly.))
  Dome Amenities: Loving neighbors, organic garden, Kitchen, Bathroom (shower or bathtub), Living room, 2 Bedrooms (varies by dome), heating, skylight and swing (some domes), freedom to perform your own dome construction ...
  Community Amenities: Chickens, more organic garden, materials yard, tree forts, love, Naked People naked neighbors, fruit trees galore, community dinners, fire pit, bike church, rope swing, best free pile ever, materials yard, garden tool shed, construction tool shed (with power tools), horse shoe arena, compost, greenhouse, freedom to build most anything you want, herb garden, ... the nicest chunk of land on campus.
  A large common green in the center
  Decision Process: consensus
  The Domes always have a MondayThursday potluck dinners at 7:00PM. Anyone is welcome to come!
  Must be a UCD student to live there.

Each of the 13 residential domes has a living area, kitchen, bathroom, and loft and can house two students. According to Ramona Pulido, who wrote an article about the domes last year, each dome was constructed of three to four inches of polyurethane foam surrounded by a fiberglass shell that serves to protect inhabitants from outside elements. The white exterior and thick insulation keeps them cool in the summer and warm in the winter. Although this construction may sound exotic, it is quite similar to most small boat hulls built since the first half of the 20th century.

Critical Conversations in the Yurt

Residents of Baggins End, the Domes at UC Davis, have hosted a speaker series called Critical Conversations in the Yurt for the past two years. We hope the discussion forums will provide an opportunity for throughful and engaging conversation around various issues that affect the wellbeing of out local and global communities. Discussions will precede or follow a 7PM potluck dinner at the Baggins End (Domes) community yurt, which is located on the property commons. The Domes property is located on the southwest corner of Orchard Park Drive and Orchard Park Circle, west of the ARC and east of West Village.  Contact Elli Pearson at erpearson@ucdavis.edu with any questions.

Spring 2013 speakers

Kat Anderson is the national ethnoecologist of the United States Department of Agricultures Natural Resources Conservation Service and a lecturer in the Department of Environmental Horticulture at UC Davis. She is also associate ecologist with the Agriculture Experiment Station and on the Faculty in the Graduate Group in Ecology and the Faculty in the Graduate Group in Geography at the University of California, Davis. She reconstructs the plant uses, harvesting strategies, and land management practices of indigenous peoples in the United States with an emphasis in California. This work involves the use of both qualitative and quantitative research methods. A unique feature of her research is the use of the western scientific experimental approach to simulate indigenous horticultural practices and assess their potential ecological effects on the productivity and yield of wild plant populations. This information in turn can be used to assess the potential application of traditional ecological knowledge for restoring traditional gathering sites, and the biodiversity of degraded ecosystems.


Alison Alkon received her PhD from UC Davis and is now an Assistant Professor in the Department of Sociology(specializing in food systems) at the University of the Pacific. She has published numerous articles on food, race and environmental justice.  Her most recent book, Black, White and Green: Farmers Markets, Race and the Green Economy was just released this year.  Additionally, Alison is a Domie of years past.

History of Domes Community Build 2011

For nearly forty years, the Domes community was managed by Uc Davis Student Housing. In January 2011, an announcement from Student Housing that the Domes would be shut down  and the community likely demolished  sparked outrage and fueled a determined community to gather support for saving the Domes from demolition. For months, residents of the Domes with vast community support campaigned to Save the Domes. A local, cooperative nonprofit, Solar Community Housing Association (SCHA), stepped in to negotiate a five year grounds lease with the University to save the community.


On November 36, 2011, supporters of the Save The Domes campaign organized a Community Build to renovate and repair the Domes. Volunteers, under the guidance and supervision of licensed contractors and building professionals helped renovate these landmark community structures. It was a fantastic four day workparty extravaganza to rebuild interiors, lay wheelchairaccessible pathways, paint, garden, make and serve food, and much more. Working one fourhour shift (or more), much work was completed in just four days, minimizing costs, and keeping rents affordable at The Domes. The Davis Enterprise covered the story, and more can be read at http://www.davisenterprise.com/homepage/featuredstories/volunteersrevampucddomes


Grounds improvements

With volunteer help, many improvements were made to the Baggins End property. Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) accessible decomposed granite paths were laid around the property. Dome 8 was entirely gutted and renovated to create an incredible ADA accessible living space. Raised hugulkulture garden beds were built and planted. Local herbalist, Leslie Gardener, helped reestablish the Domes herb garden. Local artist, Mark Riviera, facilitated a community mosaic mural now in front of Dome 7.





Dome improvements
Inside the Domes, many practical improvements were made to extend the 40year old living space. The lofts of all the domes were secured and outfitted with new guardrails and ladders. Foam walls were patched and repainted. Interior walls were given a fresh coat of paint and many beautiful murals were painted. Electrical outlets were updated and replaced with GFCI outlets. Dome 7 was converted into an SCHA/community office and study space.






History Through the Decades
They were originally built on the Western edge of campus, and campus grew around them.


The Domes opened in the fall of 1972. According to Doug Ryen, who oversaw the Domes for UC Davis for a number of years, the community was proposed in the 1960’s by a group of students who wanted to create less expensive housing options on campus.  “A few different proposals were made by designers/builders for ways to accomplish this.  Ultimately the dome style was chosen.”



“The buildings were constructed primarily by student volunteers under the direction of the contractor who proposed and designed the domes,” Ryen elaborated. There were to be 15, but the project ran over budget so the last dome was never built.  Because this dome was labeled Dome #1 on construction plans, it led to the domes current quirky numbering from 215. The construction took about one year, and the students who volunteered their time and labor were the very first residents of what was to become the sustainable community of Baggins End.

http://ucdavismagazine.ucdavis.edu/issues/su97/News&NotesTOC/News_AltVenture.html This is what the Domes looked like in the beginning. http://ecotopia.com/baggins.end/photos/ Here are some photos of the birth of the domes.

The Domes Archives lived in Herb Hall (the storage shed) until 1997, when they were transferred to the UCD Library Special Collections. There were approximately 15 boxes of photos and historical documents transfer to the UCD Library at that time.

Just south of Orchard Park, the Domes has often been home to a flock of chickens. Families from Orchard Park often enjoy walking through the gardens and saying hello to the residents hens.

The residents of the Domes try to be as efficient with resources as possible. According to Amigo Cantisano, an Organic Agriculture Adviser and Organic organic farmer, living sustainably involves “Minimizing Pollution pollution and causing the least amount of damage to the earth as possible; using local resources; growing your own food; eating food that is minimally processed; recycling; taking care of your health and your environment.”

In order for a community to achieve its goal of sustainability, it must work cooperatively. The Baggins End community is truly one of cooperation. Every second Sunday, the residents of the Domes gather to work together, usually in the gardens. Baggins End is part of the Student Housing Department and is owned by U.C. Davis. However, the residents do all of the work in the gardens and on the grounds.

The Domes are home to U.C. Davis students of varying backgrounds and majors. Justin Regnier, a domes alumni who studied Transportation Technology and Policy, lived at the Domes for several years. According to Regnier, Everyone does something. Gardening, pruning the trees, feeding the chickenseveryone contributes. Regnier believes that the Domes’ unique governing system is part of the appeal of the community. The Domes are an experiment in sustainable living. Were selfgoverning, and all decisions are made by consensus. Communication and cooperation are important.”

In order to maintain their sustainable environment, residents of the Domes rely on consensus, a policy that requires compromise and communication that was established in the community in the 1980s. Members of the community are brought together to discuss an issue until a convergent decision is made. Rather than being a simple exercise in trading (Ill stop playing my music loud if you do your dishes), genuine consensus requires the development of relationships among members (well listen to music while we do the dishes together). New residents of the Domes go through nonviolence and communication training, so that they will be better equipped to participate in the decisionmaking process. The training teaches residents how to listen to others instead of how to make others listen, explained Regnier.

Because a very important aspect of any sustainable living community is the production of food, the residents of Baggins End are especially dedicated to their Gardening gardens. Over the years, the Domes have had a variety of extensive Organic organic gardens that are maintained by both residents and members of the community. The gardens consist of multiple areas designated for specific purposes, including an herb garden and greenhouse. An area on the western edge of the property was once called the DSA, or Domes Supported Agriculture. There residents produced the a large amount of food grown for the community. Crops such as peas, garlic, onions, potatoes, eggplant and peppers are rotated yearround.

Rotating crops is a common practice in sustainable farming that offers huge benefits and results in higher yields. Cantisano explains that some plants require a lot of nutrients, called heavyfeeding plants, and can drain the soil of nitrogen in a short time.  Legume plants, such as beans, peas, and clover, are lowfeeding, and actually introduce nitrogen into the soil.  Crop rotation prevents soil from becoming depleted of nutrients without having to use inorganic or chemical fertilizers.

The cobwall greenhouse at the Domes, built by Domies and friends in 2001, is another example of the community’s commitment to sustainability. As Regnier explained, the greenhouse is constructed so that the winter sun passes through the windows and hits a heat storing rear wall. The wall is constructed of rice straw and stucco, and retains heat. As the sun goes down, the rear wall emits heat, and keeps the greenhouse warm throughout the night. In the summer, the sun travels a different path in the sky, leaving the heatretaining wall shaded. The greenhouse stays hot, but is able to cool during the evening.

While Baggins End is a residential area, members of the community are encouraged to visit the grounds and the people who live there. “We’re here and would like to see people,” explained Regnier.

The weekly potluck dinners on Monday through Thursday has been a longstanding tradition at the Domes.

Alumni Fund Drive: Support Future Development
Were asking for alumni and our wider to community to pledge financial contribution for studentdirected development at the Sustainable Research Area. Specifically, we are asking people to pledge up to $1000 (a future commitment) towards materials for the development of Domes 2.0 and the TriCoops renovations using student labor, provided that:
1. Students are collaboratively involved in the design and construction as part of their education.
2. The communities remain in habitation on or near the property during any construction or renovation.
3. The communities regain the privilege of managing their own budgets.
Conversely, if the existing communities are evicted before development or renovation of new facilities, we are asking alumni to pledge to give NO MONEY to UC Davis at any point in the future to communicate clearly the importance of these communities. There may come a time in the next few months where we will call upon you to contact the university with your pledge.
Basically: When Money Speaks the University Listens!

20110202 23:14:50 nbsp URGENT NOTE ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE DOMES, as sent to the Whole Earth Festival listserv today:

Dear Alumni, Friends, and Family,

At a forum on Monday, January 24, 2011, UC Davis¹ Student Housing notified Baggins End residents that, at this point in time, no new leases will be offered. Essentially, without further action on our part (more below), by this August the Domes will be vacant.
The condensed version:

A Domieinitiated move to fix foam problems in Dome 10 led to Student Housing calling a series of thorough inspections of all structures, the results of which they have used to justify their decision to deny any new leases. Our response has been to prioritize which concerns are immediate issues and which concerns are less relevant to the shortterm habitability. For the long term, we are working within a newly created Sustainable Living/Learning Task Force to develop a new vision for our community, involving new structures on our property. Right now, we need help from alumni to contact administration, initiate creative problemsolving, help us gain access to an electrician and an attorney, and to pledge donations for the building of new structures. See below for more detail on how we arrived at this situation and what to do about it.
The full version:

What led to this decision?

As you are already aware, the Domes are composed of a fiberglass shell with a polyurethanebased foam sprayed on the inside. The foam in 9 out of the 14 Domes is delaminating from the fiberglass shell and in need of repair. In particular, Dome 10 has the worst foam delamination. The smoke detector attached to the outer edge of the Dome opening is causing the foam at the ceiling of the loft to peel away from the fiberglass shell in such a way as to make it dangerous for a resident to live in the loft.
In the 200809 academic year, the community consensed to move forward with a project to repair the foam. One of the community members at that time was in dialogue with Central Coating Company, the company that did the original foam spraying in 1972. It seemed that the foam repairs would be fairly easy (doable with student labor) and inexpensive, purchasing kits that would involve cutting out the damaged foam sections and spraying in new foam.

Residents consensed to approach Student Housing to request that the materials be paid for with funding from the reserves generated from the universitycontrolled budget.

However, Student Housing took the project over completely. Student Housing took the foam repair project to the bidding process, stating that this was a university policy for all moderate to major (re)construction projects. The university brought several companies out to bid on the project, and none of which were qualified to do the repair work.

In spring 2010, Student Housing notified the Domes community that Dome 10 would be taken offline until the repairs could be made. At that time the university had Mason Knowles do a comprehensive inspection of the foam in all the Domes for a fee of $6575. Mason Knowles took core foam samples from each of the Domes. The findings from this foam report can be found here:
http://www.housing.ucdavis.edu/__pdf/importantinformation_domes_coops/Dome%20Foam%20Inspection%20Report.pdf
In summary, the report states that the foam in all of the Domes has decayed and needs to be replaced, and if done correctly the Domes could last another 40 years.

The university sent Mason Knowless foam report to Central Coating where they submitted a bid on the project, estimating that it would cost $43,000 to replace the foam in each Dome. This does not include the cost of gutting each Dome, which Central Coating claims is necessary, in order to do the foam replacement. (Note: If students were able to stick to the original plan of cutting out the damaged foam near the Dome hole and respraying with an insulation kit, it would cost approximately $600 to repair the most damaged part of Dome 10.)

In July 2010 Student Housing proposed a comprehensive inspection of Dome 10, stating that the university did not want to spend $43,000 fixing the foam of Dome 10 if there were other things that needed to be repaired. Thus, Student Housing scheduled an inspection that included: Fire Department; Environmental, Health, and Safety (EH&S); and Design and Construction Management (DCM). The findings from these reports is that Dome 10 is considered ³substandard² and that immediate safety issues such as electrical need to be addressed before residents can move back in. These three reports can be found here:
http://www.housing.ucdavis.edu/__pdf/importantinformation_domes_coops/halliday%20oct%207%202010.pdf
http://www.housing.ucdavis.edu/__pdf/importantinformation_domes_coops/EHS%20Dome%2010%20Report.pdf
http://www.housing.ucdavis.edu/__pdf/importantinformation_domes_coops/Dome%2010%20Fire%20Report%207%2015%2010.pdf
After the comprehensive internal inspection, Student Housing asked an engineering professor to take a core sample of the fiberglass shell of Dome 10. This sample was tested and found to be in relatively good condition. This report can be found here:
http://www.housing.ucdavis.edu/__pdf/importantinformation_domes_coops/Dome%20Fiberglass%20Summary%20and%20Report.pdf

Based on their findings in Dome 10, Student Housing decided to do a similar comprehensive interior inspection of the remaining 13 Domes. These inspections took place on three separate dates in November 2010. These findings can be found here:
http://www.housing.ucdavis.edu/__pdf/importantinformation_domes_coops/Domes%20fire%201110.pdf
http://www.housing.ucdavis.edu/__pdf/importantinformation_domes_coops/EHS%20DOME%20Report.pdf
http://www.housing.ucdavis.edu/__pdf/importantinformation_domes_coops/Dome%20Housing%20EvaluationDec2010.pdf

Much like the Dome 10 inspection reports, the most immediate safety concern throughout are the electrical outlets internal to the base of the structures. This may be a relatively simple fix involving installing GFCI outlets. The problem at this point is that any ³substantial² renovation to the Domes (defined by the campus architect as something as simple as rewiring) would trigger compliance of not only all 2007 building code but also Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) compliance for our program:
http://www.housing.ucdavis.edu/__pdf/importantinformation_domes_coops/galindo%20sept%2024%202010.pdf
Essentially the problems are numerous and interconnected. We are at the point where we need to address the electrical safety issues but doing so may require us to do a complete overhaul of the structures, which according to Housing¹s estimates would approach $1 million.
So what are we doing about it?
Weve lobbied to have the longterm future of the Baggins End property addressed via the Sustainable Living/Learning Taskforce chaired by Assistant Vice Chancellor of Campus Planning Bob Segar. For more information see the charge letter here:
http://housing.ucdavis.edu/__pdf/importantinformation_domes_coops/Sustainable%20LivingLearning%20Taskforce120610.pdf
This newly formed group includes administration, faculty and student residents from the Domes and the Coops and is charged with creating a new model for student research cooperatives. This planning process will involve coming up with a plan to build new structures at the Baggins End property in the next 34 years, thereby making many of Student Housing¹s longerterm concerns about the structures irrelevant. In addition to new structures, the Task Force is charged with coming up with a new vision for the program itself, which will likely institutionalize and formalize many of the educational benefits we have enjoyed at the Domes on an informal basis for the last 40 years. This planning/visioning process is just beginning, as their first meeting was last week, but we are excited by this prospect for our future.

This quarter Veronica Pardo, current Domes resident and Community Development graduate student, is coteaching a course with Frank Loge (Associate Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering) called Community Processes for Sustainability, focusing on institutionalizing the Sustainable Research Area (SRA).
Concerning ADA compliance, a group of Domies and Coopers, in collaboration with the Cooperative Advisory Board (CAB), drafted this plan to counter the budget put forward by Housing:
http://housing.ucdavis.edu/__pdf/importantinformation_domes_coops/CAB.ADA.plan.2010.12.6.pdf
http://housing.ucdavis.edu/__pdf/importantinformation_domes_coops/Appendix.III.Domes.Transition.Budget.pdf
Our longterm prospects look decent, thanks to the Sustainable Living/Learning Task Force, but its the shortterm that is more problematic. To deal with this, we are acting on many fronts and the details are changing daily. Following are some of the bigger themes.
We are in the process of writing bylaws for the incorporation of a SRA into a nonprofit or possibly an Organized Research Unit (ORU), which is essentially an oncampus researchrelated nonprofit, which would provide a management structure to extricate ourselves from Student Housing.
We are requesting an itemized reassessment of what in the inspection reports constitutes safety hazards that need to be dealt with immediately versus items that are ³substandard².
We are in contact with Mason Knowles regarding reassessment of the scope of refoaming that would be necessary for continued habitation over the next 34 years, until existing structures are replaced with new ones. Additionally, we are contacting several other structural engineers for a second opinion on the safety of the current foam conditions.
We are in contact with Ron Swenson the original Project Manager for the construction of the domes regarding more creative (and cheaper) fixes for the foam.

What do we need from you?
We are reaching out to our pool of highly skilled and diverse alumni/concerned community members for help at this urgent time of need. Baggins End has always attracted the most unique and effective community members and the passion and skills of these alumni can help to ensure the continued existence of the Baggins End community. The effect of concerned alumni was obvious during the Long Range Development Plan meetings in 2000 in which concerned alumni wrote letters to the University and attended community land planning forums. No doubt, the voices of alumni are urgently needed now and can potentially affect the University planning process immeasurably, complementing the efforts of current students.
As the needs of the Baggins End community are varied and robust, so too are the skills, viewpoints, and talents of the Domes alumni, and everyone has a chance now to make their voice heard.
Potential Ways in Which Alumni/Concerned Community Members Can Help:

    1.      Write a letter! Or send in a multimedia message of your choosing to University Administrators.

Linda Katehi, Chancellor: chancellor@ucdavis.edu; (530) 7522065
Fred Wood, Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs: fewood@ucdavis.edu;
(530) 7526866
We encourage you to be creative but concise/succinct in your message in order to effectively grab the attention of UC administrators. Let them know that you care about the continued existence of the Baggins End Community and perhaps how living at the domes affected your education/life.
Please feel free to include your vision for the future of the community and if inspired, talk about how your alumni contributions to the University may hinge on the fair treatment of current community members as well as the Universitys commitment to the vision and substance of the Baggins End community for the last 40 years.
One of the most unique aspects of the Domes community has always been the density of the cooperative, consensusbased housing. While there may be reasons to increase the density of housing on the property or to increase the footprint of the community in order to increase the number of potential community members, many people who have lived at the Domes and participated in meetings can appreciate that consensus appears to work best within certain limits and conditions for which the current layout of 14 discrete dwellings, each with 2 community members, appears perfect. The Domes have always been special within the coop world for this unique setup of small private spaces surrounding and coming together to make a larger tribal whole. And any thoughts on how this unique and nurturing arrangement may have helped you to find your voice, be a better local/global community member, or succeed in your life/career are potentially very important right now.

    2.      Are you a licensed electrician?

We would like to do our own independent assessment of current safety issues and affordable fixes. Please find contact information at the end of this letter to get in touch with us if you can help us with this.

    3.      Are you an attorney and would like to donate some of your skills/time?

A legal advocate would be instrumental in helping to clarify the complicated relationship between the domes and student housing, SRA nonprofit status, and ADA compatibility. Please find contact information at the end of this letter to get in touch with us if you can help us with this.

    4.      Pledges

Additionally, we are in the process of creating a communitybased nonprofit to which pledges can be made to fund the next generation of domes structures. Our message as current community members and alumni becomes far more powerful if we can match or produce funding to help shape our vision for the community. Please find contact information at the end of this letter if you are able to contribute a pledge. More information to follow.
Thank You! Together we can save the Domes!

20110215 14:56:11 nbsp Perhaps I just dont understand the issues clearly  but isnt Student Housing just closing the domes for 1 year to do some upgrades?  How does that translate into the Domes disappearing?? Users/redbike

Response: The plan to build new structures is set to happen within the next five years.  By vacating the Domes in the meantime, the University will destroy the historical legacy of the Domes by interrupting the important flow of knowledge and practice from on generation of Domies to the next.  Additionally, by clearing out the community, it will be much easier for the University to subvert the process of rebuilding, either by cancelling it altogether or deciding to just replace the structures with, say, dorms...  Users/TomDenton

20110313 21:34:24 nbsp 20110313 21:29:22   I know, I am going to be viewed as a pariah by some and not so much by others but I personally see no reason not to eliminate them and/or replace them. They are substandard for living at best at this point, are rundown and completely outside of regulations and need to be replaced.

Yes, it is a sad thing to have this ever rotating community lose its current housing situation, but then again... Is it really so?

I mean, bottom line is that that students live in this coop, not the Davis community at large. Students who are always moving on and moving out and a new batch moving in each and every year. So in all honesty, the only people being affected by this are the current residents who may not even be residents in these units next year whether they exist or not. So who does it truly impact? The University, thats who. While they might be slightly off the normally tread path, they are still taking up University space, are technically University property and fall under University scrutiny and purview. There are multiple coops available for residents throughout the city of Davis, this one just happens to fall under the category of University discretion.

So what is really the problem?

I can understand that, as far as local history goes, the Domes may have their place. If this is the main concern of residents at large, then perhaps they could convince the city to work something out with the University to preserve or move one or two of the units to a new location to be preserved for this purpose. Aside from this, there is absolutely no reason whatsoever for this to be an issue.  Users/WesP

   Wes P, I agree. Users/abybabe76

20110414 19:51:11 nbsp With the state budget what it is, I cant understand how these students feel the University should invest so much money in a project for under 30 students when they are forced to lay off their employees to meet budgetary needs.  Yeah in an idealic world they should be kept, but its just not realistic given the financial siatuation of the state.  Its a lot easier to find a new place to live than it is a job nowadays.

The Domes costs UC Davis nothing.  It requires no UCD investment.  It is a selfsustaining housing project, which pays into its own reserves and also pays approximately 10% overhead from their rents to pay for general UCD administration.  The current maintenance and renovation needs can easily be met for 1/10th of Student Housings estimates  but UCD officials have prevented Domies from doing the repairs & maintenance that they have always done, since the 1970s.  They even sent some students to Judicial Affairs for repairing a dome.

This issue is not about the Domes costing UCD money.  If anything, its about a cultural disconnect between UCD admin and the residents. In fact, if will cost approximately the same amount ($40,000) to demolish the domes, whereas maintenance & improvement according to the student/faculty/community plan would cost only $58,000.  The Domies have already raised the additional $20,000 to make it work, and has over $40,000 in reserves already. Students have the money to maintain & renovate the property  they just need administration to stop preventing them from maintaining their homes.  Users/danfodor

20110503 16:35:18 nbsp Shady UC land grab / way expensive estimates are shady!
So is preventing maintenance that will suffice

but then again we all know the regents suck and will do what they want whilst making high 6 figures  Users/StevenDaubert

20110522 10:22:12 nbsp The UC has become a really disappointing system these days.  This is mainly an example of their reevaluation of land usage and the realization that they could benefit more from destroying the principles that tie the Davis community and school together, not to mention what is a historically unique to the school itself.  Shame on UC Davis, your past is how you move forward to deny it or try to emerge from it without recognition is to completely forget what has contributed to it as a thriving school, the communities that make it up.  Someone might want to look into the school feeling that the fiscal benefits are better being a commuter school than actually having livein students because most of the students I meet now are all just commuters and mere transients to this community, dont know but it might be interesting.

20110617 05:15:36 nbsp As an Alumni of UC Davis and contributor to the school I was really disappointed to hear about this from a BART passenger recently.  I was in shock and disbelief actually.  Having worked for Student Housing I have a general idea of how much net profit they make per year and how shady this organization is.  The Colleges at La Rue were once owned and operated by the University to be later sold to Tandem a private company, I think thats akin to selling one of the campus lecture halls to Donald Trump (ie someones making loads of money at the cost of students tuition costs).  The domes were a great place to visit when I was a student and really a unique place that fostered creative thinking and ideas.  It should be viewed more as a place of learning rather than just a set of houses or a plot of land that could be better financially utilized (some things have greater value undeveloped like the quad for example just a patch of undeveloped land that no one would suggest putting a dorm in the middle of).  Anything put in place to replace it will likely not be as organic as the domes were.  I will stop donating to the university and stop encouraging people I know to go to school there.  It seems pretty apparent that the people running the school now are the same corporate minded individuals that are driving the rest of the country down the drain.   Users/heyitsdimo
