Located in North Davis in the Senda Nueva Greenbelt, youll find four Dominoes dominoes that havent yet fallen over.  11, 7, 8, and 7perhaps there is some occult meaning to this sequence?

Known to most as simply The Dominoes, this sculptures real name is Address(Domino Effect II.,38.565634,121.763436)  It was created in 1994 by Eddy Hood.




I remember running the dominoes like an obstacle course when I was young. I would do it West to East, or looking at the center photo left to right, the far right one gets scaled from a side. Users/StevenDaubert

These are located at the intersection of Quail Street and Caribou Place, by Dos Pinos. They are located at the entrance to the greenbelt, about 50 yards north of where Antelope Ave and Quail St intersect. Users/JessicaLeung
