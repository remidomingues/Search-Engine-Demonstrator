George Seamer, selfloathing English major, wrote this cartoon about himself, 2 of his old friends and eventually a couple squirrels.  He certainly wasnt an artist, but he was pretty funny.  The Dregs was one of the Aggie Cartoons, running in the California Aggie 20032004.

All the cartoons the Aggie printed plus two neverbeforeseen censored cartoons were thrown into a book.  You can buy this book at the UCD Bookstore, The Avid Reader, Davis Borders, and probably some other Davis bookstores.  You can read more about it & get all excited http://www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2004/06/09/Arts/Aggie.Cartoonist.Publishes.Book1317833.shtml?norewrite200607290132&sourcedomainwww.californiaaggie.com in this article.
