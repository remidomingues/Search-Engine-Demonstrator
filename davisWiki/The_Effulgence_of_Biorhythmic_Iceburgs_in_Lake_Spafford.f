The Effulgence of Biorhythmic Iceburgs in Lake Spafford is a project inspired by Users/KaiTing Kai. Recalling the numerous occasions when Lake Spafford got cold enough to float icebergs, we begin our wait for that to occur again.

Iceberg lettuce floating in Lake Spafford does not count as an iceberg. And obviously, any proper iceberg comes with penguins. While ducks appear very similar to penguins to all but the most distinguished biologists, the consensus is that they are different species.

 Day 1  April 13th 2007 

The wait begins.

Research will have to be conducted to determine when the last time Lake Spafford froze. Was it 1986? We will have to be ready to calculate Kais biorhythms so that the iceberg can be shaped appropriately. Three layers of ice with the proper curve frozen together and refloated as an iceberg should do. The last time the ice was almost 3/4 of an inch thick, which should work. Early morning light should be best for the photograph.

 Day 2680  August 18th 2014 

Still no sightings of icebergs.



The best freeze I remember was 90/91, but I never saw Spafford then.  86 was flooding. Users/EdHenn
