The Empire Nation is a KDVS public affairs show hosted by DJ Steve Empire (aka Steve Ostrowski). The show airs on Thursdays from 8:30am9:30am and covers national (and occasionally local) news. Steve, an archconservative, pretends to be a liberal on the show a la the Colbert Report. Unlike the Colbert Report, however, its neither smart nor funny. The first few episodes of the show were prerecorded and then broadcast at a later date. They are now airing live.

You can call in to talk to him. There are the standard radio rules, such as no profanity, racism, etc. The host doesnt want his last name said on the air because he has some paranoid privacy issues. He also wants no comments (positive, neutral, or negative) about himself unless it relates specifically to the show  what exactly that means is unclear.  It almost certainly simply means he is trying to keep the show separate from his other political activities, as he claims to be a liberal talking about liberal issues during this show, a stance which earned derision from most who know of him. His response to being questioned about the rule is, Well I have the power to disconnect the call and press the dump button. I can also just decide not to answer any calls. I would like to have a lot of calls throughout the show but there needs to be some rules in place to prevent awkward incidents. Besides, I cant have someone on the air who has an ax to grind against the personal me.

In summary, he doesnt want you to talk about Steve Ostrowski him and his ASUCD exploits/happenings, or whatever club/campaign/pie of the month he happens to be stick his fingers into. If you call in, please try to stick to the shows (either current or most recently aired) topic.

The number to call is (530) 7545387. Submit emails to mailto(empirestv AT gmail DOT com). Emails may be read on the air and commented on during the show. A first name and location is required for the host to respond to them. Emails that have substance (whatever that means to Steve) to them will have a higher probability of being aired.

20070628 17:34:13 nbsp Awesome. I missed you today. Do you have a podcast? The link on KDVS is bad. Users/JabberWokky

20070629 16:13:37 nbsp Not sure, I thought it would be automatic but it apparently does not work at the moment. I am going to see what I can do concerning that.  Users/SteveOstrowski

20070629 17:19:45 nbsp I concur with Karl Users/StevenDaubert

20070701 11:35:00 nbsp Steve is trying to ridicule liberalism but he cant do much more harm than some liberals on campus have.   But if Steve has people listening out of controversy, he has succeeded.  Users/GregWebb

20070701 14:01:02 nbsp I disagree with that assumption, I can be an excellent representative of progressive thinking and I will soon appoint myself the Voice of the Progressive Coalition.   Users/SteveOstrowski

20070701 22:46:53 nbsp Is it just me, or is the show title a copy of Michael Savages The Savage Nation (3rd highest rated talk radio show, pretty darn conservative).  Users/EdWins
   The Emprie Nation merely refers to the audience that listens and interacts with Steve Empire.  Also I firmly believe that one can be for empire and have liberal political views. And, I would consider Michael Savage to be the most conservative guy on radio. Interestingly his last name isnt Savage either.   Users/SteveOstrowski
       The Savage Nation also merely refers to the audience that listens and interacts with Michael Savage.  Also, I firmly believe that one does not have to be a savage to have any political views..... That wasnt really an answer to the question? Users/EdwinS ES
          The title of the show has no connection or commonality with the Michael Savage show and I personally dont listen to his show, although I do have one of his books...., in any case the name has more to do with the fact that everyone who listens is a part of my nation.  I had considered The Imperial Nation, but then it would sound a bit less progressive.  That said, I firmly believe one can be Imperial but still be progressive.   Users/SteveOstrowski
            Wow! You have your own nation?  Where is it?  May I visit it?  Do I need a passport? Juggling posessives is a wonderfully sly trick Mr. O; but you cant fool a magician.  As a nonsequitor, I wonder how many people support my/our/their/your/Americas troops?  I really wish I had some of my own.  Id certainly be in support of them.  WalMart, however, was out of stock.  Users/ChristopherMcKenzie
               That is correct, I have my own nation called the Empire Nation and you may visit if I so desire it.  If you are liberal/progressive we will have a pleasant conversation, otherwise its probably a debate.  Ultimately all guests serve two purposes, the first being educating the public and second being to make me look good.  As for the troops we havent really discussed that issue in much detail, but I am sure I can create something for that later.   Users/SteveOstrowski
                 I wasnt able to listen to the archives on KDVSs website.  Have you any idea why that is? Users/ChristopherMcKenzie
                  I think its because his Nation only has an Army of One.   Users/BrentLaabs

20070702 06:41:28 nbsp Cmon folks... the likely origin sticks out like a sore thumb. Ever heard of Colbert Nation? Users/KarlMogel

20070702 08:38:56 nbsp Colbert came to mind when I heard about this show. Users/GregWebb

20070702 09:24:44 nbsp If this show is as informative and as insightful as Ostrowski....then be prepared to learn nothing and laugh! Users/JamesSchwab
  Why the putdown?  Love and peace is the way to go. Users/GregWebb
   Nothing negative about a show that is complete entertainment. Users/JamesSchwab

20070702 13:45:39 nbsp The link to the podcast is screwed up, but the podcast does exist.

   It is a chore to listen to that.  You need to bring the pacing up.  It took you 10 minutes to do an introduction.  TEN Minutes.  It should have taken about 40 seconds.  Then you do things like enumerate all the states that did partial birth abortion.  I suggest that if you want people to give you a listen, that you dont enumerate lists and do 10 minute introductions.  Speed things up, orders of magnitude  Orders Of Magnitude. Users/ChristopherMcKenzie
    ChristopherMcKenzie vs. KDVS Oh noes!
      Hah, sorry.  Serious acadmeic discourse does not require someone to partake on a monotonic epic journey.  It loses peoples attention fast. Users/ChristopherMcKenzie

20070705 15:14:48 nbsp Still no podcast (on the KDVS website, I mean). Users/JabberWokky
    The podcast deal is apparently not under KDVS control so it will eventually be on the Internet within a week or so.  Some of it has to do with it being a new and unscheduled show.  Users/SteveOstrowski

20070705 16:11:13 nbsp What the hell does he do to his voice? Users/JamesSchwab
  No idea... at about 58 minutes in, it cuts to his normal voice. Users/JabberWokky

20070706 19:56:07 nbsp The Never say the hosts last name reminds me of some religions that dont permit the name of their god or some evil spirit to be uttered. Users/JasonAller
  There are some privacy issues, it opens the door to personal attacks, a person could be wrong and assume the hosts is someone he isnt, and this the Church of Liberalism.  Users/SteveOstrowski
