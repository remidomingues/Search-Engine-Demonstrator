A sports card and gaming shop in Downtown Davis.  It was a great store for all of your gaming needs and had a large play area that welcomed people to use. The End Zone was different from Bizarro World in that it had much fewer comics and more cards, including sports cards, from which it got its name. The End Zone also had many tables where people played games, and more gaming material like miniatures than Bizarro World.

Before the End Zone was where it ended, it was in the space just closer to the street, where Aesops Room is now.

When did they close?
