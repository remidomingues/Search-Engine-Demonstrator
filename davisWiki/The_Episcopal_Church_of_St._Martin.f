The Episcopal Church of Saint Martin is located within walking distance from the UC Davis campus.

Ministers welcome message:

As one of the spiritual leaders at St. Martin’s I want to welcome you. As a
community, we don’t care about your age, what you’re wearing, your gender,
your relationship status or what you have in your pockets. I believe God
wants to meet you where you are and transform your heart and I think
this is a community in which that will happen. Can St. Martin’s become your
spiritual home? We all hope so!  Mark



Very active in the community, St. Martins volunteers feed three meals a week with Davis Community Meals (Tuesday and Thursday 5:45 PM.; Saturday 11:30 AM). Other programs hosted at St. Martins include local Scouting, 12step programs, support of local homeless shelters, and other community service.
