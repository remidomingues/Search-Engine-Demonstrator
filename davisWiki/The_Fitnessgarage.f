The Fitnessgarage Sports Academy offers massage massage therapy and performance training focusing on core strength for youth and adult sports athletes. Their core training program emphasizes healthful lifestyle, strength training, sports conditioning, flexibility and agility. Core strength focuses on strengthening the abdominals, back, hamstrings and hip flexors to provide better flexibility, strength and long, lean musculature. Unlike most gyms, there is no initiation fee, nor will you find state of the art specialized exercise equipment  the focus of this facility is on fitness training rather than body building. Private and group lessons are available for youth and adults.

The Fitnessgarage hosts a variety of classes and services to tailor to your needs (see their http://fitnessgarage.us/schedule.html classes schedule).  Their program incorporates what we call CORETraining, a process that includes Performance Training, and Tutoring.

Most of the classes are $10 per 1hour session, and you can get a punch card for 5 classes for $45.  Classes tend to be fairly small with quite a bit of personal attention.  Hideshi is easily able to work around different needsfor example, Hideshi has combined shoulder with lower back and core exercises during the Friday morning lower back class, and has indicated that if someone who needs to work on the lower back drops by one of the shoulder classes, he can easily incorporate it into that hour.

The owner, Hideshi Okamoto, and many of his staff have a track & field background. Okamoto is a coach for the Japanese Olympic track and field team, a Japanese track sports commentator, a board member of the National Association of Speed and Explosion and a certified massage therapist.

Core and Balance
These classes are designed to focus on improving ones balance.By focusing on balance, we are able to strengthen our smaller stabilizer muscle, which limit your joint movement while helping the bigger muscles (ones that do the lifting) to complete the bodys movement.Balance exercises improve ones range of motion (joint mobilization and muscle stiffness) which decreases and as we age.

Saturday Morning HardCore
One of the most fascinating muscle groups in your body, YOUR CORE. Also referred to as your power house. We are firm believers that one is only as strong as his or her core. The core include your front abs (rectus abdominis), side abs (obliques), lower back, and inner thigh muscles. While all our classes do include at least ten minutes devoted to this area, it is the fastest recovering area of your body hence the hour and a half session. Please do not feel as though you need to stay the entire 90 minutes! This is more of a rotating class where you can come in anytime, perferrably before 9:30 and stay for an hour or as long as you like.

Each class is $10/session
Sat.  9:0010:30 am

20110118 14:04:14 nbsp Hideshi has been my neighbor and friend for several years.  Several times he has fixed bad shoulder pain with his massage and manipulations.  He does excellent work.  Users/JimStewart

20110527 09:59:52 nbsp I just got back from the 1hour lower back injury prevention class, having experienced intermittent lower back trouble for years.  Hideshi was fantastic, and its a really nice setup there.  The place is back in the corner of the parking lot, not really visible from the street, but its not that hard to find.  Theres no big gym equipment there; the training is dynamic and constantly active.  If youre looking to bulk up, this isnt the place to do it.  There are no memberships.  Each class you take is $10, and if they recognize you, youre welcome to drop in at other times of the day and use the equipment.

Im somewhat out of shape because of a recent injury, but not too bad.  The exercises were fairly low intensity, but constant.  I left with my quads and hamstrings quite tired and slightly shaky, my hip flexors, lower back, and abs all feeling well worked, and my upper back, shoulders, tris, and bis all feeling pleasantly tired.  I dont know whether Ill be able to work it into my work schedule, but Id love to go back as frequently as possible.  Im also looking forward to trying out the Tuesday/Thursday core and balance class.

I should also note that Hideshi himself is awesome.  Extremely friendly and engaging and a great instructor. Users/TomGarberson

The fitness garage is nestled away in East Davis, but Hideshi is worth every penny and then some Daubert
