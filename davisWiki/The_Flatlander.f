The Flatlander was a local alternative Media newspaper that was published three or four times a year. It arrived free on most residents door steps or it could be found at various locations around town. The paper focused on local politics, the environment and general happenings around Yolo County. Articles were regularly written by diverse members of the community. The papers motto was, Tell The Truth Anyway.

The Flatlander was founded in 1997 and traces its roots to a strong local alternative press tradition. Most notably Winds of Change and Farmer Bobs. Former contributors to both provided content and guidance to the first issues of The Flatlander.  Winds of Change was started by Martin Barnes and Robert Crumb R. Crumb in 1979 and ended its run in 1983.  The first issue was put together in the offices of the Experimental College. The next issue was assembled at first editor Users/ColinWalsh Colin Walshs house and later moved to its offices on E street behind Cafe Roma. When Downtown Roma became Peets Coffee the Flatlander office moved to the editors house.

The farm scene below the banner was drawn by the famous cartoonist Robert Crumb R. Crumb and was originally used as the masthead for Winds of Change. Other rare Crumb cartoons that were originally published in Winds of Change are occasionally reprinted in the Flatlander.


20061206 08:28:10 nbsp I just found the Tenth Anniversary issue on the lawn last evening. I just took a look at the website and I quote, Print the truth, anyway The Flatlander started in 1979... and now we receive something labeled Tenth Anniversay. Curious that these people go around littering the neighborhoods with what many think is trash. Ive often seen soggy old issues lying here and there. Also curious that a seemingly environmentally oriented publication would waste forest products.  Users/ChebaccoThirty
