The Flying Carousel of the Delta Breeze is located in the northern half of Central Park. The Address(Carousel, 38.545879, 121.744685) is humanpowered as the operator sits in a recumbent Bicycles bicycle seat and pedals to make it rotate.  Apparently the resulting breeze reminds some people of the Delta Breeze.
 I have a vague memory of a Sacramento radio station also somehow being involved with this. I think the radio station was also calling itself the Delta Breeze and sponsored the carousel, so the name of the carousel also referred to the radio station. Does anyone else remember this?

It is operated by Davis Joint Unified School District organizations as a way to raise money. Rides are offered during the Davis Farmers Market Farmers Market and during Picnic in the Park. The cost is a dollar to ride and all the proceeds go to a great cause: the Davis Schools. It is one of the attractions that make Central Park and the Farmers Market a Good Places to Take Kids fun place to take kids.

The merrygoround opened to the public in late 1995. It was created as a collaborative effort between http://www.dentzel.com/ William Dentzel, a fifthgeneration carouselmaker, the community, and local schoolchildren.

The handcarved carousel animals have been a target of thieves several times. Seymour the Seal was stolen in 2004 and was http://www.dentzel.com/villagecarousels/sealreplacement.htm replaced the next year at a cost of $5,000. Harriet the Rabbit was taken in 2006 and has not been recovered or replaced as of April 2007.

20100706 19:03:01 nbsp ?? Who would steal animals from the carousel ??  that is so lame.  I noticed that there was an empty spot on the carousel, and from the placard saw that Harriet the Rabbit was missing.  Is there any way to start a collection to get Harriet replaced?  Im sure that it wouldnt take long to gather $5K (e.g., have a collection box at the carousel when it is operating?)  Anyone have any input on who specifically manages the carousel? Users/markspiller
