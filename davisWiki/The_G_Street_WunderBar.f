One of Davis newer Bars, the G Street WunderBar is just one more addition to the Davis Night Time Nightlife.

The former G Street Pub has now reopened as G Street WunderBar.  It is owned by the former head bartender of G Street Pub Chris Armanini.  It opened on October 26, 2011.  Before it opened, the location underwent intensive remodeling including new bathrooms, a new commercial kitchen and an operable sewer system.  They now offer extensive food choices.  They  have four pool tables, vintage video games, dart boards, a full bar in the pool room, and free blazingfast WiFi.

They enforce some much stricter policies than the old G Street Pub, including no smoking outside the patio entrance of the building, no skateboards inside, and no messenger bags, large totes or backpacks inside after 9:30PM (people are more than welcome to study during the day and take full advantage of their free WiFi).  The backpack policy can vary depending on the nightly entertainment, when the kitchen closes, and when the 2nd Security Shift phases on.

On Mondays, the bar hosts a great Trivia Nights Trivia Night from 911 PM

As always, remember all of the Bar Taboos and etiquette regarding Tipping.

In its history, the location has transitioned from Davis Meat Market & Grocery to a very fancy restaurant (A. J. Bumps), to a biker bars biker bar, to the wellworn, allpurpose drinking spot that it now is.

 WunderBar in process 


20111026 15:56:17 nbsp Wunderbar seems an appropriate name for this establishment, since racial fascism akin to Nazi Germany was evident in my experience there last night. My friends and I (a colorful and multiethnic group of seven) had just begun a relatively tame boys night by playing eight ball and drinking cheap beer, in a throwback to the G Street Pub days. During the second round, a bouncer approached the darkest member of our group and informed him that he was intoxicated and needed to leave the property or else the police would become involved. I interjected myself into the conversation to find out exactly what my friend had done wrong (at this point I was told I may have to leave as well since I was wearing a wool beanie and only hats with brims were allowed). The bouncer was only following orders and so we soon took up the discussion with the management. Before long the police showed up. One of the officers seemed in cahoots with the management, enjoying an impromptu tour of the new space and entertaining the suggestion by a manager that my friend be charged with a Drunk in Public offense. The other officer, slightly of a darker complexion and with more syllables in his name, appeared to understand the situation and apologized that this was a private establishment and that they had the right to order anyone off the property if they so desired. We agreed (happily) to leave. The conversation took place outside the bar and when we decided to call it quits we were denied reentry to claim our sweaters and other belongings. My friend was told that he was not allowed in the bar from here on out, with threat of arrest if seen on the premises again. This was at the suggestion from the fraternalminded and lighteyed officer. To my surprise, I was given the same sentence: entry never again or else arrest. This was my punishment for asking my friends crime and for explaining things to the officers. Needless to say, my friends and I (including our money, which in part pays the salary of all employees there) will gladly stay away. If you choose to give this bromantic getaway your business be careful, especially if you are not white or dont belong to the network. Users/Andresito

  You are, of course, referring to your friend, Sellou, who has been 86d from almost every bar in Davis, including easygoing Sophias by Kevin himself(!), for getting belligerently drunk and pulling the Race Card when any staff member refuses to serve him further or let him regain entrance to an establishment.  Good riddance.  Your friend has a HUGE chip on his entitlementminded, elitist shoulder and should give up drinking in Public, because he will be arrested if he decides to step foot in this bar again.  Users/HerrWunderbar

  Knowing each of the staff members there, with the exception of two door personnel, I can personally vouch for everyone there that there is absolutely no racism in the establishment. If there was a problem with any member of your group I am sure it had absolutely nothing to do with race and everything to do with the level of intoxication of the group/individuals.  Users/WesP

20111028 09:41:17 nbsp Im willing to give the bar the benefit of the doubt. As for the police, I had a friend who was with the department for a few months and he said it was the most racist place hed ever worked (racial profiling, jokes, etc.)  Users/ScottSchiller
  I hate to say it, but that names just about every bar in this town, at least as far as profiling and jokes go. Ask any security people who causes the most problems and many wil say it is the townies, ask them who uses the most fake IDs and it will be women, usually of Asian or Middle Eastern descent... ask who tips the least and it will be Southeast Asians and Northern Europeans. Its not so much profiling as it is trends shared by specific groups of individuals. As for fights, it is almost always either drunk college jocks (regardless of color or ethnicity) or it is Asian/African American individuals. Its just what I have seen since working in the bar scene. I cant speak for the police, but as far as the bars go, it is just the trend of how things usually go in this town. I am quite sure this trend is different in every other city and even from bar to bar.  Users/WesP
   Ask whos ridiculously douchey and arrogant toward staff and its law students. Users/TomGarberson

20111028 15:46:45 nbsp My experience is that the food/drink service industry itself is largely racist.  Ask anyone whos ever worked waitstaff and they will tell you stories.   Users/OliviaY

     Nothing says nuance like a blanket statement backed by allegorical evidence. Users/HerrWunderbar

20111028 22:20:42 nbsp So this is where all of the locals hang out... Granted, it is one of the first dive bars Ive gone to. They have a nobeanies policy, they serve jaeger on tap, and there are automatic hand sanitizer machines in case you feel extra dirty. Users/argyle

20111108 14:37:50 nbsp anone know if there still do karoake tuesday nights?  Users/RobertSinclair

      Yes, from 9:30 til Close on Tuesdays.  Users/HerrWunderbar

20111123 16:29:29 nbsp They dont allow messenger bags or backpacks nor do they allow beanies. Can anyone explain to me the reasons for these policies and why no other bar in Davis enforces them? Also, like the old G st, they still have a $15 min for credit cards which is 50% more than any other bar in Davis. Users/JakeJames
   Bags take up space/trip people/could carry in outside booze?  Beanies: no hipsters allowed.

20111208 09:05:38 nbsp Since when did G St raise their standards? I remember the days hobos were allowed into the bar. Now they reject people simply for stumbling over. No big deal. Except now they get a negative comment on their daviswiki page. You suck new Wunderbar!!!!

PS I agree everyone that works there is a racist. But I could care less about that part. Users/msavrass

      No bar in town has so lenient of a door policy that hobos and stumbledrunks are allowed in. Why do you expect WunderBar to be any different, especially since its in no way affiliated to the old Pub?  Users/HerrWunderbar

20111217 17:23:29 nbsp The lights are way too bright for a bar or a restaurant for that fact.The bar/eaterys ambiance seems very sterile,kind of reminds me of a hospital waiting room especially with the bright florescent lights.Im kind of disappointed with the newGStreet barand did i mention the lights are too bright??
   Users/HallandOats

20120131 08:46:21 nbsp We visited this place for the first time on 01.23.12. The place is a dive. Not to mention a cowboy dress code only. The bar has more lights than a stadium. Youll need your sunglasses for this dive. While we sat at an unoccupied table a cowboy came up to us to tells us to vacate the table because he and his dyed blonde were there first. However, no one was at the table. I and my friend told him to take a hike and that made the little cowboy pissed. He threaten us with harm but once the shithead understood that we had attorneys (relatives) that could rip him a new AHole. He backed off. This place has a NeoNazi environment mixed in with the wanna be cowboys. Dont waste your time patronizing this dive. Spend your hard earned money elsewhere. Lets show this shithole of a place that we dont want it in Davis,Ca. Our town deserves better.  Vic .L  Users/VicttorLopez

    So you get into a baby bitchfest with another customer and its the bars fault (even though the bar backed up your side of the story)?  Im sure your incredibly great sense of judgement will be sorely missed there, especially with your drunk asses being thrown to the ground at Froggys later that night.  How was the ride in the Davis PD patrol car, comfortable? It sounds like you get the full use of our Citys wonderful services for which the rest of us have to pay.  Youre right, our town does deserve better: stay home.   Users/HerrWunderbar

20120312 12:13:10 nbsp Just went here for the first time since it reopened! Reminded of the old undergrad days. Pitchers of beer, awesome games of darts. You guys did a great job, glad to see this place back in action! Users/ShahinVahdat

20120619 00:36:03 nbsp I enjoy the hokcey game. Greatly. Still wishing for lower credit card minimums. Sometimes you just want a pint, not three or four. I know, I know, cash. Sigh. First world problems.  Users/JakeJames

20120709 15:05:34 nbsp The owner Chris was rude as a bartender (as were most behind the bar at G Street) so Im not patronizing the place now thats hes an owner. Waste of bandwidth to even elaborate. Users/MaryCarroll

     You are clearly a very patient and understanding customer to have sat through numerous interactions, on multiple occasions, to have formed such an opinion about the majority of the frontofhouse staff at the old venue; therefore, if you could just rechannel that sympathetic energy, were sure that you would find the new bar to be leaps and bounds above the old one in terms of ambiance, product, and service.  Please, come in and introduce yourself to me and see the improvements for yourself, and, as a token, Ill be happy to buy your first libation.  Users/HerrWunderbar

20120817 13:46:41 nbsp wunderbar is alright. Yes they still employ almost all of the racist/aggresive/nonintelligent aholes that swear they arent racist but you really have to be a drunken fool to think you will ever get your way at a bar vs bars owners/staff. Especially in a college town where it is assumed all kids arguing are just belligerant.

Now like everything in this world there are exceptions. For one, bartenders drew and another skinny, shorthaired guy, lighter skinned (looks like he just turned 21, lol) are really aware of whos tipping and whos not. Naturally, they will provide me with outstanding service because i tip them well. Secondly, i really like that our shoes dont stick to the floor and that girls we go out with arent twisting their ankles because of it (lol). Bathrooms were a MAJOR improvement.

What would make this an even better establishment is a better background check on bouncers. This is where the most complaints of racism/mistreatment comes from. If more than a person cries wolf, im going to believe theres a wolf. If anything maybe providing a more proactive approach to customer service training/awareness (because we are indeed customers and not animals to be treated the way bouncers believe they have the authority to do so)would cancel the need for extensive background checks (i hope you know this excludes a psychological evaluation which should be mandatory for anyone manhandling another humanbeing) and i bet all the allegations against this bar would dissipate in a matter of time.

Good work so far, but it could be even better if you stepped outside of your comfort zone and didnt hire from the more than circulated and neverrenewing bouncer pool of davis. Users/Ponchelas

20120928 11:16:52 nbsp Hmm, lets see:
racial fascism akin to Nazi Germany
the most racist place hed ever worked
everyone that works there is a racist
The place is a dive to which the comeback response included a baby bitchfest by the Wunderbars bitch and
the call for better background checks on the bouncers.

Well I became curious (before reading all of those comments) so I showed up.  Man, I wish I had read those comments before stepping into this place.

But, to be fair, you should see for yourself.  You too can be manhandled by the pathetic group of mindless muscles who call themselves bouncers. Users/DavidBarnum

20130420 20:01:37 nbsp Wow, Im actually kinda shocked at these comments. Ive been going to this bar for almost ten years. Ive never had any issues with racism. Sure there are a few assholes on staff, but thats anywhere you go. It is a dive bar. Its not that bad. Granted I usually go on Saturdays when they were having metal nights, Im friends with Mortal Atrocity and Wolfsblood members. As well as on occasion in the early evening to have a few drinks and play pool or foozhockey thing in the corner with friends. Never have had any trouble with the staff, only shitheads Ive had issues with have been the college kids. Stupid frat guys.

As far as the beanies and dress code shindig, maybe it is because Im a local and been going for so long I have never gotten any grief over the way Ive dressed. But nor have I seen anyone get harassed for it besides one time. Swear this guy had his pants to his shins. Never understood that style.

A few things I do like better with wunderbar. Better food, and bathrooms are way cleaner. Everything else pretty much feels the same to me. Its still my favorite bar in davis.  Users/Dwajon

20130424 17:35:30 nbsp My favorite bar in Davis, period. Best beer selection, excellent food for a bar (the burgers are magical!), pool tables that work, and a staff that is always warm, friendly and attentive. I really cant express in words how glad I am it reopened. I missed it. Now that its back, every other bar in Davis is difficult to compare. Users/BrianPakpour

20130526 15:39:55 nbsp Hello, I am 44 year old Chilean woman that does not have the stereotypical latin look, with a family, work, and a pretty normal Davis life. I hardly ever go out to Bars in Davis eventhough I have lived in Davis for 12 years. I feel the need to explain the following because I read the other comments on Daviswiki. To my surprise they have mainly to do with racisiim and above all the responses seem ridiculous and somewhat sarcastic. In my opinion someone that does not have the guts to use there name is not someone that should be answering the comments. But it is true that there is racisim in this place because last night, May 25, 2013, I went out with two girl friends to distract ourselves from life a while and by pure chance we ended up at the G Street Pub. We arrived around 9:00 pm. A bit after we arrived a man approached us with a red shirt and sat at our table and asked us from where we are from. My friend that speaks perfect english ( unlike myself that unfortunately does not speak it so well, but I do understand quite a lot ) says I am American but my family is Japanese, she is Chilean, and she is German. Then the man looks at me and says, OH, then I am from Guatemala and I responded great then you will be able to understand me, and I began to speak with him in Spanish and he looks at me and says, Oh I am just joking and I responded that I was not up for jokes and for him to leave my table. This is when I realized that the people with the red shirts are employees of the bar, possibly the door men or bouncers. It called attention, until this point this does not matter much but it does make sense with later events, because it was the most humiliating, embarrassing, and discriminating thing I have ever lived in my entire life.
When I arrived I ordered a Tequila Screwdriver with Don Julio, which they serve in a short glass. At around 11:30 pm we moved to the pool table area to be able to talk because the music was to loud. This is when I ordered my second Tequila Screwdriver with Don Julio of the night ( 2 hours later ). At 1:00 am my one friend wanted to leave so my other friend offered to take her home and come back because I did not want to leave just yet because I was having a good time with some other patrons of the bar that were teaching me to play pool. I was having lots of beginners luck and made the ball in the hole 2 times in a row which made me very happy and excited. I went to ask for my third drink of the night and asked for the same as before but the bar man left to poor the drink before I could say that it was with Don Julio, but since I had ordered two previous drinks like that I figured he left quickly because he knew what I was drinking since like any good barman. When he returned I asked politely if the drink contained Don Julio and he said, No you should have specified before I served it. I said I was sorry,( even though he was the one that did not let me finish my sentence before walking away ) and asked if he could change it for Don Julio because cheap tequila gives me a head ache, and he responded, No, you have to pay for this drink, so I again said I am sorry for the mistake and said that I no longer wanted anything. I went to sit on a chair to wait for my friend to pick me up. A few seconds later to men came up to me and asked me to leave, I asked why thinking it might be closing time. They told me it was because I did not want ot pay for a drink. I tried to explain with my little English what had happened and I noticed that they did not understand so I asked to barrow a phone. At first they said no, that I must leave. I said I know I have to leave but I need a phone to call my friend or husband to come pick me up, I expressed that I did not want to be alone standing outside the bar. Finally I was given a phone to use, my friend did not answer so I called my husband. I asked if I could wait there until he arrives and was told No, and a kind patron of the bar accompanied me outside. When my husband arrived in about 8 minutes because we live close by, I was not allowed inside to help clear up the misunderstanding and he was basically told a bunch of lies. This is the important part for me, I was told to leave because I did not pay for a drink. When my husband went inside to understand what happened he was told I was asked to leave for STEALING and besides this reason, that I had had to much to drink. And the most incredible part is that the manager told him that he had spoken to me in spanish and that he would never discriminate his people, and I believe him, he is discriminating me for not being his people. Yeh Right like they say her in the US. Lets use some logic, if he would have spoken to me in Spanish would we have had the misunderstanding over the tequila. And if you really do speak spanish, what a shame because you do not know how to use it. Please!!!, you are racist and a liar because all you said about me is not true, you have zero etiquette for your patrons. I understand and respect that we all have the right to ask someone to leave our private properties, but just be truthful, you guys ask people to leave because of a problem with RACISM. So if this is not racism what is it? You do not need to discredit citizens of Davis like myself, saying that I am a thief, or to drunk, or did not order the drink appropriately, or that I behaved inappropriately to hide your true reason.

P.S. For he that answers ( which who knows if it is the owner ), since your so cool and have an answer for everything, you can put your answer where it fits you best. It is I that will never go to your establishment again. It is really sad to me that this bar dirties the beauty and tranquility of this city because the people of Davis, since I have arrived have been the nicest people I have meet since being outside my country. In my opinion this Antro is a blemish on Davis.

20130729 17:08:25 nbsp Love all the bartenders, have never had a negative interaction with any of them, nor the security guards in the past. Was there last week though, and a guy in a red shirt that Id not noticed before was running his mouth more like a patron than an employee. He was going on about how someone knew all the words to the Backdoor Boys and making negative gayshaming comments about Lance Bass. Its one thing if youre there drinking and want to make homophobic comments, but when you are representing G St. as an employee, should you really be making bad jokes that could / did offend customers?
