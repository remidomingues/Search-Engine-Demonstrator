The Game Preserve was a game store owned by Derrick Bang.

For 18 years, Derrick provided the community with a very classy game store. The store was located in the middle of the block, bound by 2nd Street 2nd, 3rd Street 3rd, D Street D, and E Street E.

Inside:
 A rotating rack of puzzles
 A case of darts
 A selection of books
 Chess sets and various other games
 Miniatures
 Role playing manuals
 Shelves filled with a wonderful selection of games
 An oversize crossword puzzle was located near the counter, and each time you came in, you could see the progress made on the puzzle.

Still, it was the only place in town to get RPG stuff, so gladly we forked over our parents money to him anyway. Users/OldDavis73
