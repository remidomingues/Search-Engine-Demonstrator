There is a place in Davis where the sidewalk ends. It is fondly known to some as The Grass Sidewalk. When using the grass sidewalk, it is always best to skip, and some say its mandatory. It is never acceptable to Bathrooms urinate on the grass sidewalk, toss beer bottles or cans on the grass sidewalk, peer into the house beside the grass sidewalk, or otherwise disrespect the grass sidewalk. I will not tell you the location of the grass sidewalk, because it is only for the pure of heart, and those people will find it.

Where the Sidewalk Ends
(by Shel Silverstein)

There is a place where the sidewalk ends
And before the street begins,
And there the grass grows soft and white,
And there the sun burns crimson bright,
And there the moonbird rests from his flight
To cool in the peppermint wind.

Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black
And the dark street winds and bends.
Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow
We shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow,
And watch where the chalkwhite arrows go
To the place where the sidewalk ends.

Yes well walk with a walk that is measured and slow,
And well go where the chalkwhite arrows go,
For the children, they mark, and the children, they know
The place where the sidewalk ends.
