Oh, come gather round people children and let us philosophy consider the icy dessert concoction known as frozen yogurt.  Or as is the common nomenclature of our times: FroYo, the Xbearer of the ring of SauronX (no, that was The Hobbit someone else).  It has risen and fallen in popularity over the years, and ever shall do so. But here in the microcosm of Davis we can consider and record the ascent to greatness of fermented milk, frozen and laced with the cows bounty of fruit trees nature and candy humanity.

 The 1980s 

I Cant Believe Its Yogurt and This Cant Be Yogurt was the great cry during the frozen yogurt craze of the 1980s, and indeed in Davis there was a TCBY in the the Marketplace next to Dos Coyotes.   It was replaced in 2005 by Cold Stone Creamery.  Here the tale grows fuzzy; does this particular store date itself to being a product of the 1980s craze?  Certainly the company as a whole is, but when it was founded locally remains unknown to common lore.  Edit this entry and add to the knowledge of the people if you know when it was founded here in town!

 The 2000s 

The late 2000s and early 2010s saw an explosion of frozen yogurt shops, much like the 1980s.   Heck, for that matter the 1980 1980s itself saw an exploding things explosion in popularity in the late 2000s and early 2010s.  The wiki has stood as a keeper of the peoples memory during this time, so during this period the annals of time are better recorded.  Herein find a record of their coming (and going) during this turning of the great wheel:
