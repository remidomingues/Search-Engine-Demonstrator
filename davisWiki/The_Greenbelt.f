This entry is about the intraDavis Greenbelt of parks and bike paths.  For the conservation buffer zones around the city, see the entries for the DavisDixon Greenbelt and the VacavilleDixon Greenbelt.


Although composed of more than ten distinct yet interconnecting greenbelts, The Greenbelt refers to the nearly continuous stretch of Parks parks and Bike Paths bike paths that stretch across North Davis north, South Davis south, East Davis east, and West Davis west Davis. There are more than sixty miles of greenbelt in a town of merely ten square miles. Along with the Arboretum, the greenbelt offers many pleasant Places to Walk or Run places to walk or run or Bicycle Rides ride your bike. The green belt incorporates many bike bridges and bike tunnels as well.  Kids also use the greenbelt to Bicycling bike to Schools school. Youll also see Davis many Davis Youth Soccer League youth soccer teams practicing in the greenbelts larger spaces.

Its pretty easy to get lost in the greenbelt.  Bring a map or, when you inevitably get lost, find an adjoining streets and follow the cars until they lead you back to civilization. As such, the City of Davis provides a http://cityofdavis.org/media/default/documents/pdf/gis/maps/davis%20bike%20map.pdf bike map that shows the greenbelts in all of their interconnecting glory. The Davis Bike Loop runs through various parts of the Greenbelt and shows off the varied bike infrastructure in our town.

The greenbelt differs from Open Space open spaces, the latter of which are neither developed nor devoted to recreation.

20080607 12:44:19 nbsp I wish I could remember my favorite spot along the greenbelt, but the truth is that I found it by getting lost in it.  By the time I figured my way out, I couldnt remember how to get back to it.  The most memorable part was that, while lost, I asked someone I ran into for directions out and she couldnt help me cause she was lost also. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080618 17:43:47 nbsp The stretch through village homes between Russle and Arlington, and the Wildhorse environmental buffer are both great. Users/jefftolentino

20090326 18:41:49 nbsp I like the two dirt paths that run parallel to The Perimeter. Users/KokoSorensen

20100607 09:22:45 nbsp FYI, there are signs posted all over the North Davis Greenbelt that describe areas that may be designated  to allow unleashed dogs, but under verbal control.  There is a meeting on June 17.  More information at http://cityofdavis.org/pgs/pressreleases/repository/20100527.cfm and there is a http://cityofdavis.org/pgs/pressreleases/pdfs/Dog%20Area%20map.pdf link to a map of those areas at the bottom of that page.

20110112 06:19:18 nbsp I actually grew up learning to bike on the greenbelts in East Davis, but now that I live in North I actually find I prefer the setup of the greenbelts on this end. I love taking the household dog Ronin (a rather large puppy, I might add) out when I cant sleep, which is quite often. If you happen to see a shady figure walking around 3 or 4AM with a distinctly wolfish dog in tow, its probably me. And yes, you should be worried. Users/KBathory

20140710 16:37:56 nbsp Greenbelts are fun, they can be consider as mini yet long structural mazes that connect places together Users/Cyclonus
