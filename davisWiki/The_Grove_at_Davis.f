20130829 23:49:47 nbsp signing a lease with Gary , it was a pleasure to have him work so hard and diligently. He made this process of signing a lease comfortable and awesome. Im one of those clients who arent too wonderful to work with.... If you go here, Id recommend giving him a ring to sign a lease. The paint is nice, doesnt have that weird cheap paint feel. The area is clean and the layout plan is very homey. Everything in the apartment looks new and renovated. I will definitely update how this year goes... Users/chengy
Were super excited to have you with us here at the Grove! You were great to work with, and Im glad we could set up your appointment after hours to accommodate you! As always, feel free to let us know if we can do anything to make your stay with us more comfortable. Were about an easygoing lifestyle here at the Grove, and want you to be completely in love with your apartment.   And youre RIGHT! The paint in these apartments is pretty unique to Davis! I told you theyre the most beautiful apartments in Davis    and I was right! :) Users/garyd

20131031 20:32:18 nbsp Its a big NO NO to this apartment. I moved in this apartment on Sept. 2012 and moved out on Aug. 2013. First of all, they dont give you your deposit back. My friends who lived next door to me got $18 back from her $500 deposit. I got $0 back from my $600 deposit. My friends spent 1 day on cleaning before moving out. And my roomie and I spent almost a whole week on cleaning. We even bought the carpet detergent to clean the carpet. BUT regardless how clean you clean your apartment. They will charge you around $500 on painting the wall and cleaning the whole apartment. My friend and I got charged by the same amount, which means they dont check how clean your apartment is and they just charge every one the same amount of money.
When signing in the contract, the manager was really friendly (she even called me after her office hours). But after that, you can hardly find any one in the leasing office during their office hours.
They are newly renovated apartments. Yes, the carpet is clean and the wall is painted well. But the fridge is old and thus generate lots of electricity bill. The door was kinda noisy (it doesnt matter, but can you explain the reason why the closet door kept falling off from the trail?). The paint of white closets was wiped AWAY by wet wiper?!?! And if you are the tenant right now, please check the second and third level of the closet in your kitchen. Were they really painted? Be careful! You will get hurt by those small thorns on the bare wood....
If you dont believe my statement. Check the reviews on FPI management. They changed the apartments name so you cannot find the old reviews of this apartment. But DO look for the reviews of its management company. If you are a tenant right now, remember to take pics of your apartment when you first moved in and before you move out and email your pics to the manager. Ohh, I forgot to say that they tried not to leave you an email address so that you cannot have any written proof to the court. Then just get the signature from the manager.
I am a student in Davis. Yes, that was my first year in Davis. But I did rent apartment from other cities before. And I used to get almost all of my deposit back except for $75 carpet cleaning fee. If all the other apartments I rented before thought my cleaning was good, then why the Grove is the only one charged me $500? Yeah, they do have a statement saying that they will return around $100 back but I never got it (the statment was sent to my roomies new address but not the $100 check). I left my address at the leasing office but they never sent me anything. And I called them tons of time and left lots of voice msgs but they never replied.
NEVER choose this apartment!!! I mean it!!! Users/KeGeng

20131031 20:38:59 nbsp Ahh, forgot to talk about the free wifi. JUST try it before you move in~ You will get surprised! How come its soooo slow?! LOL. I spent 10 min on opening the google at night time but the speed was good during the daytime on weekdays. Users/KeGeng

20140322 20:07:11 nbsp The Grove has been one of the nicest places to call home, its quiet, close to work and the grounds are keep well maintained.  If I ever have a maintenance that come up in my apartment, it is taken care of as soon as possible. Jessica, the landlord has always been great to work with. I have no problems recommending The Grove to others, just stop in and talk to Jessica and have her show you around. Users/Hwilson

20140324 15:37:13 nbsp On behalf of The Grove I appreciate your feedback and Im happy we have made your experience here at The Grove a good one. We look forward to having you another year! Users/Jessbeltz

20140521 23:03:44 nbsp New, or should I say refurbished, laundry units. First they raise the price and now this. The new washers cause clothes to come out too wet which causes a big problem. Even drying for 65 minutes (the normal time is 45) my clothes were still damp. So, I had to put in another $1.25 to run a whole new dry cycle. Ive no doubt this is intentional. Big surprise someone left a note on one of the dryers claiming it wasnt heating. Buy new equipment Grove. Stop half assing it.  Users/Vivictus

20140529 13:28:40 nbsp We appreciate your feedback. The replacement of the washer machines were due to the lack of parts available for the original machines. We are definitely looking into brand new machines and will be addressing these issues immediately. Thank you  The Grove Management  Users/Jessbeltz
