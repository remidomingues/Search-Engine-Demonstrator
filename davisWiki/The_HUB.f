The HUB is the official school newspaper for Davis High School. It comes out every month, usually on a Friday. The class is officially called ROP Journalism 2/Desktop Publishing, and is current advised by Mrs. Kelly Wilkerson. The paper covers a plethora of issues, ranging from the hottest local entertainment to high school sports. They print at The Davis Enterprise printing presses.

It has been recently recognized nationally as one of the top high school newspapers, winning a few Best of the High School Press‚Äù awards by the National Scholastic Press Association http://www.davisenterprise.com/features/davishighjournalismstudentsshine/ Enterprise story here.

Recently, the Davis Police Department attempted to do an investigation regarding tagging and gang activity. The HUB, which ran the article, Art or Vandalism, in April 2011 talks about the issues regarding graffiti. However, following proper journalistic fashion, the article masks the identities of those involved in the elicit activities. The Police Department, however, desired to uncover those responsible. As a result, the ACLU is now challenging the Davis Police Department for its actions in the investigation. http://davisvanguard.org/index.php?optioncom_content&viewarticle&id4618:freespeechandjournalisticshieldorhinderingapoliceinvestigation&catid54:lawenforcement&Itemid87 article
