The Happy Neighborhood Project is the brainchild of Edwin Edebiri, the Chief Happiness Officer of the I Am Happy Project. He started the I Am Happy Project in 2009 with a mission of spreading happiness globally one person at a time. That project is now in 64 cities in 18 countries. In response to increasing demand from the happy people to refer them to happy businesses, The Happy Neighborhood Project began.

The Happy Neighborhood Project is connecting happy people with happy businesses while spreading happiness in the community. The Neighborhood is defined as a zipcode. For example, zipcode 95616, which is a typical Happy Neighborhood, contains 47,032 people, 17,229 households, $42,110 average income, and 1030 businesses. We have Happy Neighborhood Project in different zipcodes in the Sacramento Metro Area. The Happy Neighborhood Project allows us to encourage the economic impact of happy people on local businesses.
