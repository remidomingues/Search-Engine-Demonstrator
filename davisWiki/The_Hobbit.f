Davis has a very strange relationship with J.R.R. Tolkiens book The Hobbit, as well as with the other Lord of the Rings books. There are Streets streets named after places and characters from these novels (in the Village Homes), and The Domeswhich look like Hobbit housesare located in Baggins End.

In Village Homes:
  Bombadil Lane
  Brandywine Place
  Bree Lane
  Bucklebury Road
  Creekhollow Lane
  Elendil Lane
  Evenstar Lane
  Goldberry Lane
  Oakenshield Road
  Overhill Lane
  Poppy Lane
  Rivendell Lane
  Shire Lane
  Westernesse Road

Theres a page on http://www.villagehomesdavis.org/ The Village Homes website about http://www.villagehomesdavis.org/public/about/street_names each streets name.

  Other areas in Davis have different Street Name Themes

In 2002, Davis Musical Theatre Company produced a musical version of The Hobbit as part of its Young Performers Theatre lineup. On an unrelated note, the companys Hoblit Performing Arts Center is sometimes mistakenly or playfully referred to as The Hobbit.
