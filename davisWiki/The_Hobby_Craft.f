20051102 19:18:17 nbsp I was not keen on their soap section.  $9.50/lb glycerin soap is absurdthe CoOp has plain glycerin for meltandpour for about $3/lb.  Mold selection was slim and unappealing.  JoAnns in Woodland is a better choice for soapers.  Online, I like http://www.soapcrafters.com/ for selection and quality. Users/JudithTruman

20051102 19:28:47 nbsp These guys never have what I need. Its closer to Michaels rather than an actual hobby store. I dont know, maybe I have a skewed definition of hobby, but Id really like if it they had more rocket stuff and RC stuff. Users/ArlenAbraham


20060525 15:42:51 nbsp Yes, theres not much there for you unless your hobby is strictly crafts, I think The Crafts Hobby would be a more appropriate name. Users/TheodoreSuryapurnama

20070521 22:21:51 nbsp not much there for costume making (i.e. no fabrics!).  they do have ribbon though.  Their yarn is also very colorful.  i recommend Walmart in woodland for fabrics & yarn.  Good but upper end yarn can be found at In Sheeps Clothing and Knitters Playground. Users/Chibi

20070521 22:27:35 nbsp This place is closing!  Everything in the store is 25% off.  They dont have much in terms of hobby stuff like I thought they did (I guess I was expecting some model planes and rockets and fun stuff), it really is a store for crafters. Employees have always been very nice.   Users/EdWins
