The Hotdogger is a little sweet spot in Downtown.  Its a tiny little place (perhaps the smallest restaurant in town!), but theres some seating outside if you wish to eat your dog there.  They serve up a wide range of different types of hot dogs (including vegetarian options), wrapped in Village Bakerys absolutely delicious buns. Theyve got about 6 different types of mustard alone, and that should tell you something about the quality and precision of this operation.  They are friendly there and also operate a small hot dog stand near campus sometimes.  They also always have a place set up at Picnic In The Park and are often at Farmers Market. They cook the wedge fries in an oven that blows very hot air over them for roughly 3 minutes, they are not fried! You should get them with seasoned salt and try the jalapeno ranch.  They also have a newer catering menu which can range from tritip to taco bars or any other food items you would like. For more info call Ivan Franks at (530) 9022258.

Be sure to bring cash because Credit Card minimum purchase they charge for sales tax on credit card transactions.  Sales tax is already included in the price for those who pay cash.

In June 2011, Sacramento Magazines DollarWise Gourmet ranked Hotdogger the #1 place in the area to get a dog (tied with Sacramentos Capitol Dawg) and particularly recommended the Ortega Dog (see http://www.sacmag.com/SacramentoMagazine/June2011/TheDollarWiseGourmetTheHottestDogsinTown/ this article for a picture of the Ortega Dog and more details).

The owners used to operate Froggys The Pond at Froggys; the restaurant was replaced by Tommy Js.  They have a long term goal of moving to Hawaii, and his kids have been rocking kick ass mullets for many years. The California Aggie also ran http://www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2003/09/25/Arts/Local.Restaurant.Goes.To.The.Dogs1315214.shtml?norewrite200607290134&sourcedomainwww.californiaaggie.com a story on the Hot Dogger, which makes it seem that the Hot Doggers management dislikes the growth of the University.

20050905 11:07:01 nbsp Im a fan of their Chicago dog with the little peppers and sometimes with cheese for extra.  Chili Cheese Dogs are also very good.  They serve wonderful garlic fries at the Farmers Market as well. Users/IrenePark

20060518 01:12:45 nbsp I went to grab a dog between classes and found a note saying be back at 4:30. I waited a few minutes, and the owner showed up to pick up more supplies for the farmers market. Then he set me up with my dog and wouldnt let me pay because of my brief wait. Great service and food. Users/DannyWalsh


20060801 14:32:01 nbsp Ivan and Cheryl Frank, as demonstrated by their last name, know their hot dogs. Its therefore no wonder that The Hotdogger is a cornerstone and landmark in Davis. The place occupies a closet sized niche in downtown, and can seat maybe two lucky patrons and offers a few tables outside, but you can promise yourself a well worth it line at lunch time everyday.

Personally, few things are as good as hot dogs. I mean, I love having etc. etc. fruit compote, ethnic cured food from mamas hands, and prix fixe meals, but hot dogs have that tasty urban simplicity you just cant really match with anything else. This tasty insight isnt lost at The Hotdogger, and simple flares lets your chili dog runneth over!

They offer the basic hot dog, but if you want to switch it up a bit you can get a Polish sausage, Louisianna hot link, lemon garlic chicken sausage, or a Portugese wine sausage made with red wine and crushed red pepper. Veggies can lurv the hot dogs too, and get the tasty tofu dog which are actually tasty! Resist the temptation to make out with the person serving you yer dog.

Afterward you can adorn them with pickles, relish, kraut, ketchup, mayo, onions and so on. OR you could go with one of their menu options like the Chicago Dog  a dog with Dusseldorf mustard, relish, onion, tomato, dill pickle, and celery salt. Another favorite is the Gut Bomb! (exclamation point!!!); a hot link with hot salsa, hot peppers, chili and cheese, all topped with tomatoes and onions.

Regardless what you want, everything is fully customizable, and the dude/dudette behind the counter will make sure youre happy and leave with a smile. In fact, thats half the reason to go! The person behind the counter is sure to put a smile on your face, engaging you and everyone in line in bolsterous and fun conversation. Ive sat down with perfect strangers over lunch due to this. Even on your most grumbly of days, youll part ways with The Hotdogger and its other patrons with a full belly and glowing disposition.

They have, like yours truly, some pretty sweet buns, and are legend for their variety of mustards. Last I counted 6, and I had the frezty (fruity & zesty) hawaiian pineapple adorning my dog. Side of potato salad, fries, and chili are also available to you, if you need something quick.

The whole thing is deliciously shibby and its a great option if you only have a few bucks in your pocket. Make sure to drop by, sit down, and just relax with a good ol dog. Users/ProtoGarrett

20060816 21:29:58 nbsp I used to go here for lunch about once per week when I worked downtown in 1997/1998.  The service was always friendly, and the food was tasty (though Im sure its not good for you), and I like the unique character of the place.  My only complaint at the time was the fact that one of the employees (or was it the owner? not sure) had Rush Limbaugh on the radio sometimes when Id come in.  I havent been there in years  maybe its time to check it out again. Users/GrahamFreeman

20060917 02:50:07 nbsp After working in SF for a year, I grew to depend on Whats Up Dog down there on Howard and Beale. When I came back up to Davis, the first thing I did was eat two Hotdogger Chili Cheese Kraut dogs. MMmmMmm. My only desire is that theyd expand the Dog selection. I really really loved the bockwurst with grilled onions and hot mustard from WUD in SF. Users/ChrisLambertus

20070523 19:07:53 nbsp I do appreciate the punnyness on this page especially. I decided to eat here solely because of the delicious smells from their stand at the Farmers Market, and it was worth it. Now, people might just say that they merely sell hot dogs, but they are ignorant. There is a beauty and art to the proper hot dog, there has to be a balance of flavors, a good hot dog is hard to find, and this business does make such a dog. It may be a bit pricey for just a dog, it isnt some cheap deal, but I fully believe that these are indeed worth the price, and that this business makes me proud to be in the Davis community, and I love the fact that they will be open late tonight as I might need to stop by for those deliciously convectively baked potato wedges.  Users/DavidPoole

20070716 22:14:58 nbsp I have had the dogs here only a few times i have no idea why not more they are great dogs, Love the ortega dog and the chili, and just mustard and ketchup and the whole menu. If you get the munchies and they are open you will be glad you sank your teeth into that precious dog. Thank you hotdogger your the best!  Users/dickjones

20070718 19:51:08 nbsp I dont even like hot dogs very much, but I like everything about this place.  I like that I can get an all beef dog.  I like that its a small holeinthewall with lots of character.  I like that I have so many mustards to choose from  the Hawaiian pineapple mustard is really good (sweet and savory).  I like the potato wedges that are baked instead of fried, and actually have some potato on them.  I might actually become a hot dog person! Users/CovertProfessor

20071221 03:55:17 nbsp I wandered into the Hotdogger for the first time last night. Had a hot dog with ketchup, relish, onions, and pineapple mustard, with a side of wedge fries. Probably one of the best hot dogs Ive ever had outside of New York. The pineapple mustard is delicious and its amazing that the wedge fries arent deep fried. Yummm. I am now craving another hot dog, but its 4 a.m... : Users/ScarlettYing

20071221 13:40:04 nbsp The GutBomb is soooooooooooooo good. The bread soaked up all the chili and it tasted amazing. It really is called the Gut Bomb for a reason. I only finished 3/4 of it and I usually eat like four or five plates at the DC...The guy working there was really nice too. Im going back for another hot dog as soon as I finish this comment. Users/DannyYu

20080323 18:24:03 nbsp I really enjoyed the decor at the Hotdogger, but I felt slightly awkward in there because I was literally at an arms distance from the proprietor and the cook. I attempted to start conversation with them, but they didnt seem interested at all to speak with me. Nevertheless, the hot dog was pretty good (I would say along the lines of Top Dog good) and I would definitely return for another dog. Users/EmilyTung

 I ended up having the opposite experience most times I go here.  The various cooks tend to be pretty talkative to me, but then again, maybe they are just humoring my talkative nature. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080926 12:50:46 nbsp This place is fantastic, and as yet seems to be undiscovered by the plague of incoming freshman. The seasoned baked fries,  and the pineapple mustard are especially marvelous. And no, I definitely did not hesitate to describe a hot dog place as fantastic. :) Users/VanessaZ

20081120 20:05:26 nbsp Love their polish sausages and wide variety of mustards! I just wish they didnt charge $1 to use a credit card. I only come here when Ive got cash on me, and that is very rare. Also, this place seems like its never open... Users/MAlexa

20091111 10:46:14 nbsp This family owned business has a lot of character and some good food at a decent price. The prices are a little higher at the Farmers Market than they are at the hut, but the atmosphere of the market and the side show that is the owners wisecracking while he runs the grill at the market are worth the extra money :) I prefer the Chicago dog and seasoned fries. Users/GJC02

20091112 22:32:44 nbsp This place is very expensive.  However, the food is delicious.  I got the Ortega dog and it was great.  I had no idea how many varieties of mustard sauces there were.  A hot dog and two medium drinks ran me 9 dollars, which included the 1 dollar surcharge for using the credit card.  When my wallet gets too full, I will be coming back to try the other hot dogs.  Just a side note, the owner is very interactive with his customers and was cracking jokes and making conversation with the several that were waiting for their meals to be prepared. Users/BenLee

20100626 14:58:50 nbsp I like the veggie dog. Ivan is always very friendly and chatty. Cheryl is nice but can be distant at times.
The best thing about this place is that our community is supporting a hard working family and not some
fast food chain. A lot of family owned businesses in Davis like James Anthony were not able to survive the
recession and closed their doors. Users/nowhereman

be sure to get season salt Users/StevenDaubert

20100809 08:29:00 nbsp Finally remembered to try this place out this weekend. A was a little disappointed with the prices and quality of chili. For five bucks, Id expect more of a homemade chili taste and not out of the can. They were out of the wedge fries but the replacements were adequate. The ranch dressing was some of the best Ive tasted in Davis so far. The lady working the counter was super nice and friendly which will most likely keep me coming back when Im in the mood for a good weenie.  Users/103

20110219 20:22:28 nbsp My friend is absolutely in love with the Ortega Dog, but I personally love the Lemon Chicken Sausage and the WEDGE CUT FRIES. (And this is coming from a person that doesnt even like hotdogs!) Users/ChocolateFrogs

20110304 12:10:32 nbsp I dont like hot dogs, but Ive eaten here twice of my own accord. The hot dogs (regular) are so juicy and flavorful, doesnt at all taste like those mystery meat dogs from childhood days. Ive gotten the Ortega dog, and the cheese and bun turn out spectacular when toasted. Ive also had the seasons wedges with ranch... too die for! I wish more places would use that method of cooking fries. My only compliant is that the prices are a little higher than what I would want to pay for a hot dog. $17 for two dogs, wedges and a drink seems quite expensive too me, but the quality is also much better than that of a regular hot dog stand. Overall, I would eat here again, though due to the prices, not as regularly as Id like to.  Users/jwieland1989

20110317 21:03:10 nbsp Really great place. I highly recommend the Chicago dog. Try out all of the mustards, especially the Russian hot mustard. Also, I love the woman behind the counter. Shes always really friendly and funny, not sure if shes the owner or what, but good service. If you have flyers youd like to put up around town for university events, they are happy to put them on the front door.  Users/AbigaleMoody

20110722 16:12:19 nbsp I love this place!  The Chicago style dog is delicious and if you like a spicy dog, the Russian honey mustard is the best.  Lots of variety as far as the sausages and mustards go, and the buns are really fresh.  Great comfort food and the owners are local, which is a plus.  Very friendly staff, too.  No wonder the line is usually long for their fare at the Farmers Market! Users/ShelleyB

Cons:expensive, and never open Users/MicahPerez

20121119 15:06:06 nbsp I got chili cheese fries once and it was honestly really disappointing. It was my second time with them, and I thought the first time was pretty good but perhaps because I ordered fries after someone who also made fries, the cook seemed to have made one order and split it into two (or worse, made mine smaller to enhance the other persons, who seemed to be a regular). They were a little raw, and literally doused in chili. I think I had 6 or 7 wedges and the rest of the container was chili, which wouldnt be so bad if I was looking for a bowl of chili... Other than that, I like the idea of this place, including decor. The hot dogs are never bad when I eat them, and I like their mustard choices, but that chili cheese fries incident has turned me away a bit, since I dont opt for hot dogs that often.  Users/HannahToru

20130104 11:20:58 nbsp Ive branched out from my old favorite the chili dog, and now try the Chicago its good. Also dont bother going higher than seasoned wedges with ranch... Those fries arent broke so dont try and add more fixins Users/StevenDaubert
