Started since 2006, The Imaginary Zebra (TIZ) has committed its designs to the modern fashion medium. Imagination is the key to express. It is our ability to spontaneously generate mental images, interpret life, and bring meaning to experience.. We promote the use of imagination, and the individualism through everyday clothing. However, our works represent more than apparel.The TIZ Design was made to incorporate and express today’s world. Every project that we engage in is, to us, another opportunity for creativity and imagination. Despite being a young company in a vast industry, our dedication and hard work is not less than that of any designing firm.

Well, I’ve given you the basics, you’ll truely understand who we are and how we progress through examining our products and interactions. Regardless, keep an opened mind.

 “Imagination is greater than knowledge.”  Albert, my man, Einstein.
