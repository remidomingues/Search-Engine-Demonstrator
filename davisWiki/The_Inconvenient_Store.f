20110313 15:43:13 nbsp I love name :) Users/jsbmeb

20110314 17:58:23 nbsp They are going to get a water boiler soon so you can buy the ramen and eat! Also tried the cold ramen package thing. Blew my mind Users/David.Tran

20110314 22:34:00 nbsp oh snap some Asian sniznacks

Im sold on the name of the establishment alone Users/StevenDaubert
    Just the name caused Sarah and I to step in and check it out.  We poked around and thought it was a really nice little place.  Its small but has a neat, clean selection of stuff. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20110315 11:20:53 nbsp The space is very small. I guess I was expecting more because the mirrors had me fooled into thinking the store was bigger. I expected to see a variety of Asian things from soy sauce, curry mixes, frozen delights, etc but they only have snacks, sweets, ramen, and drinks. So dont come into the store thinking this place has more than that.
I noticed some of their prices are higher than Kims Mart which is just in downtown Davis near Chase. So Ill save myself the trip and money and go to Kims Mart instead. Users/Kenny0427

20110315 14:51:19 nbsp I noticed that the drink prices were a bit more expensive than Kims mart too, but then I realized that the CRV is included in the price as well; so it seems like theyre all around the same price. Users/Bitcheshateme

20110316 13:19:34 nbsp I love just looking at all of the products! The owners are very nice, and have offered me free samples of the scarier snacks, and also said that they will look into recommendations for stock. I will probably end up frequenting this place much more than is healthy. Users/ThomasReeder

20110319 03:18:40 nbsp I was super excited to stop by here the other day after seeing it on Facebook, and while the place is a bit small, it has everything I want (Calpico, Ramune, Pocky,Kasugai gummies, Shrimp chips) and even stuff Ive never seen (which is saying something because I grew up in San Jose with lots of Asian grocery stores/snacks).  I came out with some awesome green apple mints that Ive never seen before but tasted great which made me pretty happy.  Yes, the prices are a little expensive compared to Bay Area prices (but not by a lot!), and about the same as Kims Mart.  Its actually very appropriately priced considering that this is Davis.  But what really got me was how genuinely nice the guys who run this store are!  This place will definitely get my business over Kims Mart for that reason alone.   Users/JennPham

20110326 19:50:39 nbsp Good selection of snacks at reasonable prices, and the owners are super super nice! Users/Ryu

20110328 14:19:24 nbsp Despite being a small store, the Inconvenient Store provides a decent selection of snacks at what I would consider normal prices. Personally, I hate having to drive to Sac to get snacks and stuff, so its nice to have something in town, and especially something close to campus.  Users/Morganna

20110601 19:15:21 nbsp Pretty friendly customer service. It may be small but its loaded with a great variety of pretty popular Asian snack brands. Its good to hear that theyre eager to expand and keep adding more to their selection. Great hours. I hope theyre here to stay! Users/MelannieLavarias

20110626 22:32:46 nbsp yo where were you guys tonight? me and my friend dropped by around 945 and the doors were locked with no one inside. the lights were on and the sign said open still though. while we were there two more potential customers came by to be disappointed as well. Users/benjaminplonchkiercken

  Hey Benjamin! We were at Delta Venus dropping off a birthday gift for the birthday girl. We put up a sign but the fan inside blew it away, but either way it was our fault for not making a better sign. If we havent lost your business return and well make it up.


20110628 10:04:41 nbsp Customer service here is very good, the staff is very friendly and happy to recommend products and take special requests.  Good selection of dried squid snacks, now all they need is fresh mochi. Users/DagonJones

20110711 14:40:11 nbsp Snacks are so great and fun! I recommend the crunky :) Users/MaryMurphy
   Thanks for the rec. Crunky really is great! Users/ScottMeehleib

20110719 23:23:29 nbsp the first 3 times i went, they were closed during their posted hours such as the day after picnic day, one random sunday, and another but nonetheless, i like it cause the workers are funny. hahaha Users/SallyVo

20110721 20:55:53 nbsp I cant recommend this place enough. The service is good and its open late. The small space is wellutilized with a good variety of products, some of which surprised me! Users/ScottMeehleib

20110810 13:05:03 nbsp Ill check out the sea vegetables.  The Coop has them. Users/BruceHansen

20110816 16:58:24 nbsp The owners are really nice! The shop is clean, and its nice to have a selection of Asian yummies in Davis finally!

But its pricey compared to Ranch 99 or other Asian stores in nearby cities. Not bad for Davis though. Users/PaulV

20110913 11:28:06 nbsp Im a big fan of this place.  Whenever my household is feeling latenight snacks, we pile into the car and go visit Charlie.  (Hes the one who works nights.) Users/JMitchell

20111221 21:57:16 nbsp This is such a clever store Asian snacks that are otherwise inconvenient to find. I really hope these guys become wildly successful and open a million of these stores.   Users/ActionFigureBarbie

20120409 22:59:44 nbsp Awesome place! Great customer service too. Hard working and catering to the students! I really hope they are here to stay so that I can blow a lot of my wages here :) Users/MelannieLavarias

20120703 02:50:14 nbsp I LOVE THE INCONVENIENT STORE! They are super friendly and helpful. KEEP IT UP ! Users/HannahToru

20130318 17:00:53 nbsp Love this place! So many yummy snacks and the staff is really friendly! Users/gurglemeow

20130505 13:59:05 nbsp This place is amazing.  They have a large variety of snacks, which is awesome for me.  The guy who was there today was really friendly and I had a nice conversation with him.  The prices were great, especially since it meant I wouldnt have to drive up to Sacramento.  I even got a free item to apologize for not being open the other day, which was really, really nice and completely made my day (it was a melon ice, which are delicious and Im buying one next time).  Im definitely coming back here again and I hope their business continues to do well and grow.     Users/HeatherNicholoff
