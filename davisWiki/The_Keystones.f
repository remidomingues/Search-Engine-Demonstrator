 The Keystones 


The Keystones, formed in September 2004 by five talented musicians/UC Davis students, played a mix of classic rock, blues, jazz, funk, and country with plenty of originals, exciting solos, improvisation, and great female lead vocals. They played gigs throughout the fall, winter in spring and finally disbanded after the Summer of 2005.
