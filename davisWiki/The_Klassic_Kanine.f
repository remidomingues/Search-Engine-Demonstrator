Klassic Kanine, a pet grooming pet groomer, has gone mobile.

The old grooming shop, located at 525 Rowe Place, is no longer open for business. After being at the same location for almost 25 years, the building was sold. The owner decided to just close the shop and start a new chapter in her life by taking her business on the road, delivering professional grooming services to peoples homes or offices. As her new motto says: Professional grooming thats goin to the dogs.

What are we talking about?
We are talking about the same owner.
The same groomer.
The same great service.
The same phone number.

And...

Still servicing the Davis Area.

Highly recommend this pet grooming shop.  They are very helpful in helping you figure out just what you need for your dog, and are very caring towards the dogs.  They are timely with their grooming, and they even give your dog a cute bandana every time!  They also groom cats.  Strange, but true.  Users/JenniferLaFever

20090521 13:00:48 nbsp Last time I called, she did say she was going mobile, because the vet is taking over her space. Perhaps her phones is just temporarily out of order until she arranges it to forward to a new one? Users/NotSure

20090528 13:01:46 nbsp   Elisabeth is grooming our dog right now.  Very nice van.  Grooming table rises and lowers which is nice for older dogs.  She said her phone answering system was overwhelmed by so many calls after she closed her shop. She started operating from the van this week and she hopes the new phone system is working.
