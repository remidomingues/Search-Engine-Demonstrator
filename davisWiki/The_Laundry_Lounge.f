Formerly called Suds, this may be the best laundromat in Davis. They always have attendants on duty to make sure that your clothes are safe and to help you with the machines. They have a large mix of machines, including super energyefficient front loading machines that fit twice as much laundry and use half as much water as the top loaders. They also have two giantload machines for washing rugs and blankets or that giant load that has piled up for weeks. They offer wash and fold at $1.55/lb or the DropALoad Service for $25 for a big bag that can hold upwards of 40lbs of dirty laundry. See their website for more details.  They also offer free pick up and delivery as part of their wash and fold services. Additionally, they will transfer your clothes from the washer to the dryer for FREE if you ask them to, that way you can run errands and come back when your clothes are dry.


They have two couches, comfy chairs and tables for sitting and studying, as well as chairs and tables outside. Free Wifi is available, but you have to get the password from the staff. Staff is always there to help rectify any problems you have with other customers or the machines. They have sodas available behind the counter and a change machine that gives quarters.  There is also an assortment of laundryrelated products for sale on a rack in front of the counter.

Find them by walking through the breezeway between Dosirak and the 49er Video building, but there is a separate parking lot, accessible off Hanover, so you dont have to carry your laundry so far.  The parking lot is shared with Sutter Health administrative offices.

20080602 20:40:22 nbsp Last week I found myself in a quandary, I was super busy moving/writing final papers and realized that i was out of clean undies.  As I was about to have a mini nervous breakdown at the thought of having to wash and fold all of the laundry that I had been avoiding I remembered my friend telling me about their free pick up and delivery service. They came by to pick up my clothes in the morning and by early evening I had a clean, nicely folded stack of laundry at my door. Thanxs again! I will definitely be coming back. Users/gchilde

20080602 22:04:03 nbsp This place is clean, cheerful, and everythings works!   It doesnt have that have that creepy depressing laundromat feel.  You know, like youd rather put on the nasty stuff laying on your bedroom floor than go to a place where several of the harsh lights are out, the paint is peeling off the walls, some of the machines dont work, people are sketchy, etc, etc.  This place has free wifi, friendly staff, and the people who come in are NORmal!  I still wait till everyting I have is dirty, but now I dont mind going to do my wash when I finally have to. Users/Spiketronic

20080604 16:42:04 nbsp This place is in a great location, its clean and they can move your laundry from washer to dryer WHILE YOU ARE GONE! Its very cool that I dont have to wait for my laundry, and since they are there all the time no one will steal your stuff.  Users/KimPruett

20080630 00:12:43 nbsp I dont enjoy doing laundry but this place is really nice. They have two giant machines that seem like they can handle anything. The big machines get my clothes really clean and it saves me money compared to splitting the load up between a bunch of machines. Im also happy that the attendant will transfer my load from the washing machine to the dryer so I dont have to spend my whole afternoon there if I dont want to. The free wireless does makes it a lot easier to spend time there. It is also very clean and bright. Users/Etherington

20080809 13:28:28 nbsp Had a strange experience there today.  Went today and there was virtually NO ONE there.  Normally on Saturdays (at least when the laundromat was SUDS) the place is hustling and bustling. There was only customer there before me, and two who came in after (and left before me).  When I left there was no customers left, and this was just before noon. Finally, mostly importantly, there was NO HOT WATER!!!!  The hot water for the whites cycles was just barely warm.  Im hoping that this was an aberration and that I do not have to find a new laundry spot. Users/AnnieSirrah

20080929 10:04:47 nbsp Went there again recently.... the hot water is only lukewarm.  What is that about??  Starting to think this is a cool place to do laundry unless you have towels, underwear, other white laundry to wash. Users/AnnieSirrah

20081012 01:15:53 nbsp unless your laundry is extreamly dirty, hot water is not needed. It is better for the environment to use lukewarm water and for most loads it is still sufficient. Users/RedCourn

20081012 10:14:21 nbsp hopefully the new name means new ownership and new STANDARDS. i went to SUDS about 6 months ago and someone had just washed a barnful of HORSE BLANKETS in the front loading washing machines.  the place reeked of horse odor, and they had hay in them. the floors were covered in mud and the attendant was trying to mop the place up. i asked if there was a rule (or maybe a law?) about washing farm animal supplies and she shrugged her shoulders. i was so appalled i almost reported them to the BBB. is it too much to assume that the machines are for human laundry only?  i went back last week to the new laundry lounge, and despite there being few places to actually lounge, and they dont have recycling, it was cleaner. im still afraid to use the front loaders though. who knows what kind of mites are in horse blankets.   Users/aro

20081024 15:45:59 nbsp My Name is Dina Connor and I am one of the owners of the Laundry Lounge. Our customers satisfaction is VERY important to us! We DO in fact have hot water. When we took over, there were a lot of machine maintenance issues to be dealt with. If you find that a machines water is not hot enough, PLEASE come and tell us! We can see if there is a clog in the hot water line or if the machines temperature controls need to be adjusted. We can also provide you with compensation if things are not up to par.

As far as the horse blanket situation, we do our best to make sure that people dont abuse our equipment.  Obviously when its busy we cannot always keep track of what every customer is doing at every moment.  If something like that were to happen again, we would have to asses the situation and see if it is appropriate for that particular person to wash their items here.  We will always clean and sterilize any machine if you ask us.  Of course, every machine gets sterilized thoroughly at the end of each day.  We really appreciate you bringing issues to our attention as soon as they happen and giving us a chance to rectify problems for you!  I am in the store everyday at different times, working on equipment and talking with customers.
Feel free to grab my business card by our cash register and contact me anytime!
Thanks!

20081107 10:02:52 nbsp Went there again recently and the water WAS very hot!  It made my day and made my life easier... I had a bunch of laundry to do and didnt want to do it all in my apartment complexs limited and unclean wash place.  Also noticed (after my last visit) that one of the owners contacted me directly to tell me that if there are ever problems, then to contact them directly so that the issue can be rectified.  I will certainly do this!  And I will be back again. :) Users/AnnieSirrah

20081224 14:15:29 nbsp This place is awesome! Its clean and bright and thats exactly how our clothes are when we get them back. Thanks Laundry lounge! Users/realitycheck

20090214 12:03:29 nbsp This is a great place! Although I own my own washer and dryer, this is the first place I would go if in need. The place is well lit and it has internet so enough said! The couple who owns it is nice and cheery and the employees they hire are amazingly omnipresent...two thumbs up :) Users/AvaLorraine

20090408 09:30:20 nbsp I think this is a great business but am still perplexed why the hot water is still frequently out. I find it even more strange that the owners dont tell customers when they come in for laundry or transfer service that the hot water is out.  Yes, Redcourn you may not need hot water to wash clothes, but it should still be warm.  (And perhaps peoples clothes are really soiled?  How do you know that they are not?) When the hot water is out at this location, the water is cold or maybe tepid.  Also, if the owners dont use hot water for environmental reasons (which I am beginning to suspect is the case), the owners should make the point to tell customers and use that as a marketing tool (e.g., were going green) so that customers can make an informed decision about where they would like to take their laundry. Users/AnnieSirrah

20090519 14:19:31 nbsp I hate to say this, because I am kind of friends with the owners, but I cant do my laundry here anymore.  Like other posters said, the water is frequently cold, but in addition I have seen some very shady washings going on by customers in full sight of attendants and managers and I hate to think of what kind of things my clothes are being washed in.

For example a poster previously mentioned horse blankets, well I have seen rugs, shag carpets, outdoor mats and straight up large area rugs being dragged in here to be washed in the same machine you might put your bed spread in.  I dont know about anyone else but that just disgusts me.  I would rather wash my clothes in Putah Creek than wash it in something you washed the dog bed in!

Also, the dryers are unusually crowded with junk, if you look down past the mesh barrel that holds your clothes theres not only dust and lint, but gum, pens, money, garbage, and who knows what.  And most of them smell weird, like a moldy rubber bath mat or a bandaid.  And I have dried clothes that come out burned in some dryers and completely damp in others (burnt is worse).  Thanks but its a little too expensive for my aggravation. Users/CarrieBishop

20090702 16:46:58 nbsp I just went in here for the first time this week.  I LOVE this laundromat!  First of all the staff is super helpful and friendly they came up to me and showed me how to use the equipment and asked me if I had any questions.  Then they offered to change over my clothes from the washers to the dryers for FREE, I couldnt believe it!  I didnt even know a serivce like that existed! It was so great, I went and ran some errands and came back and my clothes were totally dry!  Amazing.

Plus its the cleanest laundromat I have ever been to and they were playing The Decemberists on the stereo, so Cool!  I will definitely be back.  I guess they have free wifi too, Ill be bringing my laptop next time.  By the way, the water was scorchingly hot and the place was completely spick and span.  I dont know what those other posters were talking about.  Ill be back next week with more laundry! Users/Audrey13

20090827 17:39:27 nbsp Whoa! If you havent already tried their free pickup and delivery, you should get on it now. I left the laundry outside my door, they came and picked it up while I was away, followed instructions, and delivered the laundry, clean, dried, and folded! Very impressed with the service. Cost is reasonable and whenever I talked to the staff, they were always professional and nice. It is an awesome feeling to give your clothes and get them back totally clean and folded the next day! Very happy with the service. Highly recommended for busy people! Users/KevinW

20091102 13:56:00 nbsp Went there the other day. The service is very friendly. Machines are pretty clean. Plenty of space to fold and sort. I will for sure come back! Users/davisoldie

20091205 18:48:06 nbsp Im still astounded that while studying for finals and writing papers my laundry was picked up at my front door and returned cleaned and folded at no charge. As a full time college student that has a job, I dont have the time nor do I have tons of money. Not only has the laundry lounge helped me get a better grade on my finals but also has helped my sanity :) Before I was aware of theie free pickup service they provide, I would do my laundry personally there at the establishment. I always felt comfortable being there, as a woman alone and my clothes were safe because there is always someone attending the place. This place is great. I NEVER leave comments about businesses ive been at, but seriously this place has really calmed me this semester. Thank you you guys.  Users/chelseah8

20100105 21:21:27 nbsp just went here to wash my comforter, which had gotten a bit rank over winter break. unfortunately the fluffy monster didnt quite fit in a double load, and both of the triple loads were full, but one of the attendants said that if the person with the justfinished triple load didnt come back in five minutes shed just take their stuff out for me, and so she did. change machine took even my ripped bills, and i was able to go run errands and get some boba. while it was a bit more $$ than I expected ($5.50 + $2.50 to dry) it was still much cheaper (and faster!) than the alternative (taking it to a dry cleaners). the price is def worth it for the complete lack of shadiness factor.

my only complaint is its very cold near the seating area, im guessing due to vents + big windows. but thats it :) Users/KellyCorcoran

20100112 18:11:18 nbsp This is definitely the nicest laundromat Ive been to.  I felt completely safe, and knew my clothes would be too.  Its clean and cute and the attendants were really, really nice.  Ill definitely be back! Users/deeray82

20100128 10:24:06 nbsp I really like the FREE transfer service. Doing landry can take up so much of your day! Its especially annoying when you want to enjoy what little time off you have, not spend all day doing chores. With the transfer service, you take your clothes in, start them in the washers, and leave the attendant with money for dryers. They tell you what time to come back so you can spend that time running errands, getting stuff done, or sleeping! When you come back your clothes are dry. Im a huge fan of this place and I appreciate that one of the owners is almost always around. Its obvious they really care about their business and are always trying to improve it. Users/LilyS

20100413 21:35:01 nbsp Best laundromat Ive ever been to.  Users/sjoe

20110224 15:02:58 nbsp Im in love with their drop a load service. This week I had midterms and my life was just too crazy, so the laundry started piling up. I never used a laundry company before, but I needed some help. I gave them a call and they picked up all my laundry in garbage bags until I got the Laundry Lounge Bag. Turns out I had a little more than the bag would allow. But the owners kept the $20 because they had told me it was about 4 garbage bags of laundry, and thats how many I filled. It was finished quickly and done well. When I got my clothes back, I was worried about wrinkles. As their website states, their unique packing system will prevent wrinkles. Needless to say I was skeptical. Well, that packing system is genius!!!! It kept all my clothes in unwrinkled condition and compact. Considering I usually have to pay $15 plus my time to do my laundry, the $20 is a steal. They pick it up and deliver it which is absolutely amazing. I will most definitely be using this service again!! Users/JessH

20110325 22:40:21 nbsp Went there today after my crappy toploading washer finally died a painful and deserved death. The owner was very cool and helpful with more insightful laundry tips in ten minutes than Ive received in my whole life (and Im not young); clean, welllighted, and comfortable Ikea furniture where I could comfortably chill and read while the machines did their business. Huge thumbs up.  Users/Swilltopower

20110623 18:55:26 nbsp The staff that work here are very friendly and helpful.  Well lit, clean and lots of washers and dryers.  A great place to do laundry! Users/stodd84

20110828 11:21:30 nbsp Overpriced and machines are not that amazing unless you need something really huge. Sort of clean, but not really.  Users/hankim

20111129 07:35:36 nbsp I absolutely love this place! They have an amusingly named Dropaload service, where they will pick up a GIANT bag of laundry from your house, wash it, dry it, arrange it neatly in your bag, and drop it back off at your door step the next day, for $20!  I dont have a car, so this works very well for me. The employees/staff are all very knowledgable, helpful, and courteous, and the owners are great. Its not a bad place to hang out if you decide to take your laundry in and do it yourself, either. Pleasant colors, lots of magazine, and free wifi. Users/KianaFreitas

20111209 09:53:40 nbsp Ive left my positive review for this business before, but I just want to reiterate how much they help me in my business. As a massage therapist I generate around 60lbs of laundry per week. There is no way I could afford the utility bill increase and hours of time it would take me to get this much laundry done every week. Their commercial wash and fold rate is a total boon to my business and I recommend other businesses check out their service. It more than pays for itself! Users/LilyS

20120130 11:11:35 nbsp I used The Laundry Lounge for the first time yesterday after reading some of their reviews. I have to say that I was highly satisfied with their services. I spoke with both of the female attendants who were working there at the time and they were extremely helpful in regards to my questions. I had come in with a queen size blanket and sheets and they gave me advice on which washer was the best to use in terms of the size of my load. I understood from reading previous reviews that they offered a free service of transferring your washed clothes to the dryer for you, and then calling you to inform you of when your load was done. I decided to forgo that option though it was certainly tempting and instead chose to bring a book to read while waiting for my blanket and sheets to wash and dry. The lounge was comfortable and I felt as though very little time had passed before I was done. Great service and great employees. I definitely plan on coming back when I have large loads to wash.  Users/LyndaLe

20121103 16:03:04 nbsp I dropped off a large bag of laundry Friday morning around 10 am. It was my first time there, so William explained the services. I chose Wash & Fold and was told to return in 24 hours. When I picked up my laundry the next morning. I assumed that Wash & Fold would cost more than $25 (DropALoad). The bill came to $23. I liked that the laundry was not only folded but organized in paper bags (e.g., folded sock pairs were in one bag).  They do a good job. Users/nowhereman
