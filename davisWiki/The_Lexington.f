The Lexington is an apartments apartment complex managed by Hallmark Properties in the small sliver of town in between downtown and I80.    It was voted the Best OffCampus Housing in Davis in 2006 for Best Of Davis, by The California Aggie.  The office has an after hours answering service that allows you to put in a work order any time you remember to do so. It also allows you to leave a message for the office or get in touch with management in case of an emergency.

The Lexington is a good example of http://extension.ucdavis.edu/unit/online_learning/course/description/?typeI&unitOL&prgListLUP&course_titleOvercoming%20Obstacles%20to%20Infill%20Development&CourseID29527 infill redevelopment that the City of Davis is trying to emphasize over http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_sprawl urban sprawl.  Due to its location, most resident comments emphasize that the benefits of such close proximity to UC Davis, downtown and transit options outweigh the the worst intersection in Davis challenges.  This is one of the worst designed apartment complexes as far as parking is concerned  potential parking spaces are instead occupied by over 20 motorcycle spaces (none of which are used), ugly trees, randomlooking tanbark islands, and unused electric vehicle spaces. In addition, the complex has a very narrow twoway street for parking while still having angled parking, making things exceptionally difficult when other people are around. To further show their hatred of cars, the covered parking spaces are extremely close together with poles between them, causing frequent fenderbenders among residents. There are also four needless speed bumps that you must pass over. When leaving, you will also have to struggle with the worst intersection in Davis.

The Olive Drive Market is technically a lessee of The Lexington, and seems to get most of its business from there as well as The Arbors. There are a few other retail/office spaces (similar to the spot occupied by Olive Drive Market) in the complex as well. During the 2004 election, one of the unoccupied spaces was volunteered as a polling location and was where most people on Olive Drive voted that year.

One intriguing feature as a neighbor of the Lexington is that anybody strolling down Olive can hear many conversations from anybody on the balconies. The acoustics are perfect for a pedestrian walking slowly to hear various things like a group of people mocking a single person for thinking that White Castle was a real restaurant, or a single sided phone conversation where a woman was trying to decide if she had had sex the night before. The arrangement of balconies and flat walls turns that stretch of Olive into a acoustic voyeurs sweet spot, regardless of the intent of the pedestrians.

The people on this street go Dumpster Diving here frequently.

During large turnout Voting elections, The Lexington often hosts a polling place for neighborhood voters. Sponsors blood drives sometimes.

Bicycle  At the western end of Olive Drive, there is a connection to The Davis Bike Loop.  That bike path will take you safely and quickly to shopping choices at Oakshade Town Center in South Davis (under the train track and I80) or north to Davis Commons.

Pedestrian  Need a quick snack? The Olive Drive Market is located onsite. For recreational adventures, the Arboretum is really close and also accessible at the end of Olive Drive.  For dining, shopping, and nightlife activities, a quick walk under the historic Davis Subway, commonly known as the Richards Underpass, will put you in Downtown Davis.


Parking  Covered and uncovered parking available.  Since this complex was built recently, progressive parking features that encourage alternative forms of transportation were required by the City of Davis.  Motorcycle, ultracompact and electric vehicle enthusiasts will find many spots to the chagrin of SUV drivers. In addition, the complex has a very narrow twoway street for parking with angled parking, which forces drivers to be more careful of other forms of transportation around them. There are also four speed bumps to calm traffic.

ADA Accesibility  Unknown.

20081018 02:41:49 nbsp Can anyone comment on the noise level at lexington? especially about the freeway  Users/sweetsoni
    Go stand there at night.  If thats not an option, I lived next door at the Arbors, and the noise level (in an apartment more toward Olive than 80) was not even noticeable.  People opinions of what is acceptable noise levels differ, however, and there are probably different noise levels in different spots.  It really should be something you should go check out.  In fact, if you are sensitive to noise you should go check the noise level at all the different locations you are considering, even without a major road nearby, as your future neighbors might tend toward being louder than a freeway.

20081110 13:25:51 nbsp i live there now for the 0809 school year and its been pretty great so far

my only complaints are that my bike got stolen and parking can be a hassle if you live the olive drive side and have to back out of the 10 car lots because its full

compared to other apartments, it definitely has a edge in a community feel about the place Users/fredchen

20081220 13:20:11 nbsp Ive lived in Lex for 3 years, and overall it was an ok experience. On the positive side the units are new and have good utilities, its a moderately quite environment (except for the weekends), the management is quick to respond, and the location is very convenient. However, Lex has some annoying qualities. Patrol plus is far too authoritative! They break up all parties no matter the size, sometimes having 5 people over is too much for them. Patrol plus has literally pulled me over in the parking lot for speeding over 5 mph, and made me line up in the pool area because I was in there past 10pm. Theyre a joke! Lately Olive Dr. has been attracting some sketchy people. Tons of bums hangout in front of olive drive market and innout. They havent been a big issue but they are just everywhere and its annoying to have to coexist with them. If you spend a lot of time studying, Lex may not be the best place to live. The train tracks and I80 border the apartments. Expect loud music but the noise level really depends on your neighbors and where your apt is located within the complex. Users/armaraglia

20090118 10:49:46 nbsp Do they require complex specific bike parking permits: Image(lexington_bike_permit.JPG, thumbnail)? Users/JasonAller

20090119 13:43:04 nbsp Yes, we do require complex specific bike permits.  If you are a resident and you have a bike, please come get a permit in the office.  We do this because we sometimes go through the property and remove any abandoned bikes.  Your sticker helps us determine which bikes to cut and which to leave. Users/AndreaTheLexingtonMgmt

20090227 16:11:43 nbsp Does anyone know if they include utilities(electricity/water) with rent? Users/DolphinOmega

20090302 15:43:40 nbsp The rent includes water/sewage/garbage.  The resident is responsible for PG&E and Cable/Internet.  Hope this helps! Users/TheLexingtonManagement

20090426 12:59:58 nbsp What is the rent for the 09/10 school year?  Users/ashna.singh

20090430 10:27:02 nbsp Please give us a call at our office and we would be happy to go over the pricing and what we have available for Fall 2009 Users/TheLexingtonManagement

20090503 01:17:19 nbsp I did call twice and emailed the property but no one got back with me with the information.  Users/ashna.singh

20090504 15:35:37 nbsp Ashna, we have located your email and have sent you a response. I greatly apologize for the inconvenience. Users/TheLexingtonManagement

20090529 15:57:40 nbsp Ive lived here for 2 years, 20072009. First year (0708) was fun.  Neighbors were considerate and nice. Office people were helpful. This past year has been horrible.  Neighbors are loud and inconsiderate.  Many people dont park within the lines especially the covered parking spots.  I dont think Lexington breaks up many parties because my neighbors are constantly partying throughout the week.  There are always drunk people running around screaming at 3 or 4 in the morning even on the weekdays.  Complained to the office multiple times, yet there was no change.  Im all for partying, but be considerate about it.  Some people like sleep when they have class at 8am or midterms/finals the next day.  Also, our water has been shut off twice this month without notification.  The rent is overpriced.  Rooms are small and the layout of some rooms are horrible.  Cant open the closet when the door is open.  Not worth it.  The only good thing is that they respond to maintenance requests fast.   Users/zahra

20090901 18:07:24 nbsp YOU DO NOT WANT TO LIVE HERE! First off the location is a nightmare and lots of freeway noise and low income housing across the parking lot with drug dealings..super over priced for what you get! But most important  read the fine print on your lease. They automatically ding you $140 for carpet cleaning..even if you had it professionally done yourself. They also expect you to be responsible for the fact that Davis has well water and it leaves rust stains on their cheap plastic drop in shower/tubs..guess what they ding your security deposit..oh yes if you dont pull out the stove and clean all along side of it..or god forbid you dont pull the light fixture in the kitchen and clean it out...you will get dinged for that too. I am not kidding..its a racket and they know college kids are usually not savvy enough to fight it..well they messed with the wrong person..we are reporting them to the California Consumer Affairs department and taking them to small claims court to get back the $400 dollars they want to charge us! I (the mom of one of the kids) personally scrubbed the apartment with the kids..it was cleaner than when they moved in! Upon their recommendation I cleaned out the god damn window sills too but when the kids did a walk through they said it wasnt clean...B.S. it wasnt clean..I did it myself! PARENTS BEWARE  I WOULDNT LET YOUR KIDS RENT THIS PLACE UNLESS YOU PLAN ON NOT WANTING YOUR DEPOSIT BACK!!! THE STAFF IS HORRIBLE AND RUDE AND THE PLACE FRANKLY IS A DUMP AND NOT KEPT UP WELL FOR WHAT THEY CHARGE! Thank god the kids moved out of this hell hole!!!! So renters beware!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Users/flusk1

20090918 17:36:31 nbsp VERY DISAPPOINTED BY THE LEXINGTON MANAGEMENT REGARDING MOVE OUT!  I have to say, overall, my experience with The Lexington management was great.  They were quick to respond to problems and seemed very friendly and always helpful.  However, my move out experience has been terrible.  During their initial walk through they pointed out things to clean like the inside of window sills, the blinds, the lint remover tray of the washer and dryer, etc.  I spent over 8hrs cleaning (this does not include the time that my roommates spent as well).  I cleaned the inside of the window sills, washed each of the individual blinds down with soap and water, even removed the cobwebs from the cathedral ceilings in the staircase area.  They still ended up taking over 2/3 of our security deposit!  Upon speaking with them regarding charges for things I know FOR A FACT were cleaned, I was told that one of their employees did a walk through and said it was dirty.  Furthermore, this was corroborated by the cleaning company they hired.  Well, I KNOW what I cleaned.  Im guessing the employee just assumed that someone wouldnt take the time to wipe down each individual blind.  Well, I DID.  It also seemed like the cleaning company checked each box saying they cleaned everything just so they could charge for everything.  Practically every box was checked claiming they had done something.  I am so disappointed by their refusal to work with me regarding these charges that I know are false.  To be charged over 2/3 of our security deposit when we left the apartment in great condition (nothing was destroyed or broken, only law students ever lived there) and when we spent DAYS cleaning it is simply ridiculous.  It makes me wonder what we would have been charged had we actually had broken something or had not spent any time cleaning and simply left the apartment as it was.  I am quite seriously considering taking them to small claims court.  It isnt even so much the money (quite frankly, the amount of time it will take me to contest these charges versus the amount of money I can earn doing actual legal work during that time is not worth it) but the injustice of this situation.  I have a very busy schedule with not a lot of free time.  I spent what little free time I had cleaning the apartment.  For what?  Im really disappointed by this whole situation tainting my overall experience at The Lexington.  My word of warning is this, expect to get very little of your security deposit back whether you clean or not.  Go in expecting this and perhaps you wont be as disillusioned as I have been.  Users/LawStudent

20100119 11:37:33 nbsp I love this place! the faculty here are friendly and are always willing to be of any assistants! Its close to campus and downtown Davis. The minor consequence of living here would be noice from the freeway and the train. The major issue, the price. But you get what you pay for! Users/jasolnl

20100206 12:19:59 nbsp Well, if you want to have people over Lexington is not the best place. The layout is set up kind of...awkward? For the squarefootage you get the space really isnt utilized, it feels really cramped. If youre looking to share a room, I also wouldnt recommend here. The room is barely big enough to fit two beds in. Also, the bathroom situation sucks. If you have people over then they have to go upstairs and through your room to use the bathroom. As for parking, its hard to find parking after 10pm. I sometimes come in at weird hours of the night and cant find parking. Its a little pricey but understandable because its so close to campus. I can actually walk to my classes in 15 minutes! You cant find that anywhere else! The management at Lexington are awesome! They make quick repairs and are always there to help. As for previous noise complaints I have to agree. From my unit you cant hear the freeway, but you can hear the train, but after a while you get used to it. And there are tons of parties at Lexington and they do get loud, but hey, its a college town, what do you expect?  Users/stargurl8526

20100218 08:44:28 nbsp Can someone tell me the dimensions of the upstairs bedrooms in the 4x4 townhouse?   Users/sms
  20100224 11:30:53 nbsp Here are the dimensions you requested: (Upstairs rooms from Left to Right) 116x11, 109x11, 10x11
Please feel free to contact the office if you have any further questions :) Users/TheLexingtonManagement

20100415 10:01:23 nbsp We would like to announce that we are offerring roommate matching in our 3 and 4 bedroom townhouse layouts. Each room has a private bathroom and there is a washer and dryer in each apartment. Please call us for information! Users/TheLexingtonManagement

20100507 17:02:58 nbsp I have friends that live here and the place is pretty decent however the area is freaking SCARY!!! I never go by myself at night...there are always weird people lurking around!   Users/sarahpurcell

20100711 13:22:59 nbsp I LOVED living here. The staff is awesome (thank you Arren), the place is really nice, and after a few weeks, you get so used to the freeway that you do not even notice its there:). The train noise can be annoying but it runs a few times a day so that isnt as bad. I am sad to be leaving end of August but its kinda expensive which is the only reason I will not renew my lease. But you get what you pay for, thats for sure! Thanks for the maintenance crew who are so prompt and responded to everything i requested in a timely manner.  Users/psychstudent

20100924 15:51:31 nbsp BE CAREFUL WHERE YOU PARK! The Lexington shares a parking lot with the Cesar Chavez apartments, and if you park on the wrong side of the row of parking spaces, they will tow you and you will be paying hundreds of dollars because they didnt make it clear which spots are offlimits. Both office managers were very sorry but couldnt do anything about it. Both managers also cited the other apartments doing this to each others residents as justification for doing it to each others residents. Sounds like something they should work out more effectively. I understand parking is limited and I wouldnt want my spot taken by someone who doesnt live there, but making the situation clear to all residents would be nice.

Also, the towing company used by both apartments will not contact you when they tow your vehicle, even if it has a Lexington permit. As I was not expecting to be towed, a couple days passed before I became aware of what happened. The tow guy called the Lex because they are friends, and they called me. I dont want to think about what wouldve happened if he hadnt made that call. Users/aggie12

20100924 17:10:49 nbsp An update to my last comment: They sent out an email about the parking area and apparently it is also noted in a newsletter that was just sent out. Users/aggie12

20101005 00:52:02 nbsp After researching (as well as living in) many apartments in Davis, I must say this is the best place to live.  The location is close to safeway, the gas station, school, and downtown. The management is always quick to respond to the few maintenence issues I have encountered and they also send out monthly reminders in texts and emails to pay rent in case you forget. They even make breakfast and host bbqs throughout the year too. I love having my bathroom in my room and how big the closests are. The train sounds used to bug me, but after a while you get used to it. Having a washer and dryer in my unit is also a plus along with the free printing in the study lounge, pool, and work out room. As far as parking goes, it does get rather crowded at times but I have usually been able to find a spot, even if its relatively distant from my unit. I dont understand why other people are complaining about the towing and security in this complex. They tow cars with out permits so that YOU can have a space and I like that patrol plus is here regularly because it makes me feel safer especially with the trailer park being on this street, I have seen some shadey people walk by. There are also multiple signs that label which side is the Lexingtons in terms of parking (its on our side of the street as common sense would suggest) and which side is Ceasar Chavezs, if you didnt read them thats your fault not the Lexs. I am totally renewing my lease next year! I recommend this place to anyone who wants a good apartment in Davis, this is way better than your typical student living  you get what you pay for and believe me you will be more than satisfied. Everyone I know loves living here and is really friendly. Users/Sweetnsexy7189

20110901 14:46:36 nbsp As a manager at The Lexington, many of my residents who have been with me since day one are now graduated, packing up their things, and off to start their lives in the big world :). I would like to take the time to thank all of the residents who have been with us this past year and especially those who have been here since my first year back in 2008. I, as well as The Lexington Staff, wish you nothing but the best there is. I can only hope that your time here at The Lexington has been a wonderful one. Thank you for letting us be a part of your college experience and if you are ever in Davis, make sure to stop by and say hi, as you are family and always welcome here :) GOOD LUCK!

I cant forget our new residents! :)
We want to welcome you to the 20112012 year at The Lexington! If you have any questions or need anything, please do not hesitate to stop by the office or give me a call. Even if it is just to come by and introduce yourself, I would love it! I can assure you that this year will be a great one! :)

Yours Truly,
Arren Medina Users/hazeleyes16

20110901 15:55:44 nbsp They have some of the nicest people in the world working at Lexington.  After my lease ended with SSA, I had a 3 week gap until I moved back into my new apt with Lexington.  Knowing that I had this huge gap and lots of big furniture (like my mattress) to move, they provided me with FREE storage space until my move in date!  How many places do that?  The gym is great and everyone is considerate in the study room (just bring your own paper).  I highly recommend this place. Users/JonathanColet

20110912 17:42:20 nbsp The noise level at The Lexington is usually tolerable on most days and nights but the most recent turnover has attracted some rude BassLoving tenants. I live at Cesar Chavez and constantly all you can hear is bass and more bass and even more, terrible, soundwavewasting BASS. I could make a reference to Bea Arthurs heavy breathing here but i wont cuz I just did.
 Users/JustinYoder

20120127 17:24:42 nbsp Noise level sucks big time especially if you are on a bottom floor apartment. Lots of heavy booms, bumps, and crashes that shake your stuff. Music blasts most nights. Call the security and THEY WILL IGNORE YOU!!!!! Get good earplugs, cause you will have neighbors who blast music at all hours. Tell the front desk and they say they cant do anything about it, even though, if you read your lease, thats a violation! So if you are okay with parties three or four days in a row and a liquor store right next door, youll be in heaven. Users/sammckee

                        On behalf of The Lexington I wanted to express my sincerest apologies if you have felt your feelings or concerns have not been addressed in a manner pleasing to you. I do understand your frustration and hope    that you do stop by the office and talk with Andrea and I both so we can come to a solution for this problem. My goal, as a manager of the Lexington, is to create the happiest and most pleasant experience possible. I really hope you do come and talk with us. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. Arren

20120626 21:54:31 nbsp In reference to what the poster above said  yes, this year its been a little bit noisier than most. Unfortunately, I think thats one of the cons to living away from mommy and daddy, in that you cant be sheltered in a big nice house insulated from sound at all times throughout the day. For all those reading, keep two things in mind when making your decision: 1) Its a college town and 2) there are places a lot worse. Focus on the silver lining. I know people in Davis who live in areas with cockroaches, or places so far that it takes them half an hour to bike to Davis, or places with no gym, no internet room and printer, no staff that provides free food all day during finals week along with free quarters in a cup for unlimited coffee. Lexington apartments is easily the safest/best place in all of Davis. Not to mention half the time people had parties, they put a nice note a week in advance informing me it will be loud on such and such date, and please dont call the cops call them first, and that they welcome my company.

Im sorry for those who are finally getting a taste of the real world  but count your blessings. Many of you who graduate will either be moving back in with your parents, or moving out into an apartment somewhere else. So dealing with neighbors you may not like will become commonplace. Focusing on every negative and ruminating is an easy way to get stressed out for the rest of your life. Just my 2 cents. Users/JonathanColet

20131101 20:45:45 nbsp I have only lived here for two months and have had a number of disappointing experiences with the managementbut no other complaints thus far. First of all, the first time I came in to the office to sign some leasing information after receiving an email to do sothe manager simply said she didnt know what we were talking about. This is not only unprofessional but just rudeif you are the manager you should know better than to say I dont know what youre talking about to a resident and offer no further suggestions as to how to obtain the information that is needed. Secondly, they leave passive aggressive notes on your door with issues that they expect to be dealt with within one business daya ridiculously short period of time, Not to mention, Ive lived here for two months and am barely being informed that we havent been paying PG&Ewhy werent we informed after month one? To say the least the management is clearly disorganized considering we were told we had to get renters insurance before weve moved in and we still havent been reprimanded to do that. They are also not friendly or happy people at allunlike the staff at The Colleges who are always more than happy to see you and answer questions! Other than the management I love living at The Lexington so far. Users/jatucd

     Dear Resident,
     We apologize that your transition here at The Lexington has not been as smooth as it should be. Can you please make an appointment to speak with us directly regarding your PG&E and renter’s insurance. Some of our regular    movein requirements seem to have been overlooked in your case, since you took over someone elses lease. We are very sorry for any inconvenience or stressed caused and would very much like to resolve these issues.
