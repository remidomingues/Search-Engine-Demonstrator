The Library was an arcade that was primarily known for its witty name.  Kids could sound like they were being academic to their parents by spending lots of time at the library.  It is now Departed Businesses long closed, but it occupied the space where the southern half of Woodstocks Pizza is now.

The front half of the place was newer games while the back half had an air hockey table, and basketball game, and a few classic arcade games that were running but always had for sale signs on them.

The most notable games in the back other than the air hockey / billiards were the oldschool helicopter game and NFL blitz that was constantly updated

From the mid90s onward the place seemed to get more run down with few if any new games, and a fair number of games being out of order at any given time.

Closed in the Late 90s/Early 00s (?).  The space was then filled by The Velvet Elvis for a few years before Woodstocks Pizza expanded into the space.

I used to be a regular at the library when I was really young, it kicked lots of ass and had a decent selection of games as well as awesome fake dollar bills that were gift certficates that worked in the token machine.  Users/StevenDaubert

20061024 18:17:23 nbsp Alas only the Davisites and hardcore students who have been around long enough to remember it Users/StevenDaubert
 20070626 07:54:09 nbsp Truly hard core Davisites remember when it opened... Users/WesHardaker

20070504 19:40:29 nbsp I went here when I was really little.  The Virtual Fighter 2 machine had a switch on the back that would alter how many tokens were needed to play.  I would always switch it to zero so I could play for a long time. Users/JoeyBennett

20070610 01:05:27 nbsp I can confirm it was still open for business in 1999, back when I came to visit a friend and check out the school. Users/AlexMandel

20080315 17:42:40 nbsp I remember plying here alot in the late 90s. Met lots of great friends that I still see to this day. Wish there was something like this still around. Users/Aaron.Curtin

20080329 16:39:33 nbsp Dude, I TOTALLY remember this place! Users/CurlyGirl26

20080407 09:37:08 nbsp I remembered when someone (who is now a DavisWiki allstar) got in a big argument in there.  And then the lifted him up and totally threw him in trashcan.  Oh man Junior High school is funny. Users/BenjaminRosenstein

20090628 14:59:06 nbsp It opened summer 1982.  Their first few years, they had some older games including Space Invaders that were set to take dimes instead of quarters.  Some other games let you play 2 or 3 times for 1 quarter.  They also had a jukebox.

Circa 1983 they started using tokens which you could get from a machine, 5 for $1, and most games you could use quarters or tokens, but annoyingly all the new and popular games only took quarters (so you could only play 4 times for a buck instead of 5) and you had to ask someone on duty for change as there was no machine for them.

Also during their first years, they would put signs on top of some machines with the alltime high scores achieved there. Users/AlanSmithee

20100501 17:14:24 nbsp Ahh.. Many an hour was spent studying at the Library. Gauntlet II and Rampage made my allowance vanish mysteriously.  Of note, it used to be a Chinese restaurant. It still had the Asianthemed front doors on the place up until Woodstocks expanded. But yes, it did sadly wane in the 90s, what with home gaming being able to meet and eventually surpass the arcade experience. Users/Flynn

20100724 13:46:23 nbsp So sad on days like this when youd kill for a cool shady place to hang out outside of the house.  I suppose the MUGA may just have to suffice.  Users/MasonMurray

20110804 14:52:44 nbsp Great place when it opened.  Dimes instead of quarters meant you could play Pacman and Centipede all friggin day.  The owner would come by and sometimes add more quarters or dimes to your machine while you were playing, just as a thank you for being there.  Long time Davisites will also remember the completing place on the corner of 3rd an G, Atlantis (I think thats right).  Rumor was, they were owned by a Casino company, and were just in town to cash in on the video game fad.  Never heard if that was actually true or not, but the Library was still the place to be.  Still miss blowing $20 every weekend on T2. Users/OldDavis73
 I think Atlantis is right!  It really rings a bell in my head at least.

20110804 16:09:41 nbsp Back when it was Honorable Gees, they used to have a big @$$ Buddah statue out front.  It used to be the classic frat prank to steal that thing... they tried chaining it down, but I swear it must have been stolen at least 5 times in the early 80s. Users/OldDavis73

20120601 02:56:25 nbsp My aunt gave me some tokens from here and the MUGA that she found in my cousins old clothes. He went to Davis around the late 90searly 00s.

Ill probably resist the urge to see if they work in the MUGA and keep them as a piece of Davis history. :D Users/HarrisonM

20120813 23:59:57 nbsp Anybody remember Games Plus? It was a VERY small arcade in the location where The Hotdogger is now, opened a few months before The Library and Atlantis. They had less than 10 games there and they would kick kids out who hung out to watch people play but not play themselves. Users/AlanSmithee
