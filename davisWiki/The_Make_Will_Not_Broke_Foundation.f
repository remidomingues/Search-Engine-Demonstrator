Your good buddy, neighbor, or acquaintance Users/WillJobe Will Lee Jobe is in a bit of a sticky situation: his phone bill somehow magically added an extra 182 dollars than usual! It seems we have some angry player haters on our hands. His phone company is being a douche and not helping. His parents have declared him broke until he can pay back that 182! That means he cant go out and have pizza with his friends on a Friday, it means he cant take the Amtrak to go around and visit his good buddies, and it means he cant have FUN. So its come to this:

If you donate to the Make Will Not Broke foundation, you will get an offical hug or handshake (your choice) from the man himself, as well as undying graditide. We are going to try to get at least 182 people to join, each donating a dollar, but any amount is welcome.

So, please help a brother out and donate today!

Make your pledges on here, then either pay them directly to Will in person or mail them.
