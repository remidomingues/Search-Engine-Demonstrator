There is not much to say about the Man in Black Pajamas except the following:

 1. It was originally known as The Chinamen
 2. It was the indiest Bands band in Davis history by all accounts and definitions.
 3. Their status was put to the test by indie sensation Mexico.
 4. The band played the shortest ever set in Delta of Venus history, clocking in at a mere 7 minutes.
 5. At least one member scored with a high Schools school girl as a result of the bands influence and prestige.
