The Mesh (the mesh or themesh), started through a joint research project between the UC Davis Department of Computer Science and Orange labs, is a wiki:wikipedia:mesh network comprised of many WiFi access points to provide wireless access to campus, specifically the Segundo residential area. The projects claims to offer a blanket of outdoor coverage to the area.

The Mesh, with an SSID of themesh, can be accessed from many places in the Segundo area and, like moobilenet, requires a UC Davis ID and password to authenticate. Additionally, The Mesh offers specialized applications and services that, according to the project, are both fun and useful.

Since the Mesh is a research project, coverage is not guaranteed across the area  and is strong in a few select points, specifically focusing on the Dining Commons.
