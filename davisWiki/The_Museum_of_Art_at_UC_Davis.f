The Museum of Art at UC Davis will be a research and teaching museum with broad public programs. Home to the collections of the Design Museum, the Carl Gorman Museum C.N. Gorman Museum, and the Nelson Gallery Richard L. Nelson Gallery & The Fine Arts Collection, the museum will engage audiences across Northern California.

The facility will cost about $30 million.

In December of 2011, a $10 million grant from Clos Pegase winery owner Jan Shrem and friend Maria Manetti Farrow was http://www.sacbee.com/2011/12/16/4126498/10milliongiftwillhelpbuild.html#storylinkcpy announced. There is already $2 million given in 2010 by Margrit Mondavi, and UC Davis has promised a $15 million dollar taxexempt bond, which put the museum with just $3 million left to raise.
