Ting Guo Dr. Ting Guos Research and Development research group studies the dynamics and properties of nanomaterials using laser and xray pulses occurring on the order of femtoseconds (10^15^ seconds). We use the nations only 50Hz, Terrawatt, Ti:Sapphire, femtosecond laser system to produce high intensity xrays and perform time resolved transient absorption spectroscopy.
