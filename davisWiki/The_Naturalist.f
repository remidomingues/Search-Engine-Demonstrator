The Naturalist went out of business on January 31, 2010. Alphabet Moon plans on opening at the same location on March 1, 2010.

The Naturalist was a Town Wildlife nature/environment themed gift shops gift shop, voted best gift shop in Yolo County.  They carried Birds and Bird Watching bird feeders and food, field and hiking guides, nature themed gifts for the home and garden, exquisite jewelry, tshirts, and binoculars and other optics suitable for either Astronomy Club stargazing or Birds and Bird Watching bird watching  among many other options. Many offerings featured recycled and nontoxic materials and many were made by local producers like Jeeba, Holly Yashi or Wild Bryde jewelry, Sonoma Lavender, and Fire and Light recycled glassware. They offered wildlife prints and photography by local artists, too. For the kids, there was a selection of fun and educational toys that were all themed around environmental education. One stop shopping for gifts for the whole family (even the difficult ones!) and plenty of customer assistance if you needed it.

They used to be at 219 E Street Suite A, and were replaced by In Sheeps Clothing after their move.




20080304 21:51:16 nbsp Ive walked by the Naturalist dozens of times and have always mistakenly assumed it was part of Mengalis Florist Mengalis.  Its unfortunate that the store seems to be a little lost in that grey, boxy building.  Its not obvious what they sell there, but its worth a visit.  I stopped by after I found out via the Net that they carried a particular hummingbird feeder I was looking for.  The store was nice, the customer service was even nicer...very friendly and we traded hummingbird stories for awhile.  Ill stop by again soon. Users/DukeMcAdow
   After posting that, I cant walk by the store without noticing it and realizing how far it is from the florist!  The displays in the front window are very attractive, as is the view of the store interior.  ...and its the only store within 40miles that stocks Droll Yankees hummingbird feeders! ;)  Users/DukeMcAdow

20090304 19:56:21 nbsp Near the register, there is a bowl of rings.  One caught my eye and I purchased it, the lady working mentioned that if I needed it resized the man that made them was local and could resize it; but I was eager to wear it.  It was a little big, so a few days later I took it so it could be resized and it only took a day and I got back to wearing it. :) Very good and kind service.  Users/kmpulido

20100223 18:17:23 nbsp Cynthia and Kerin of the Naturalist are opening a web shop to fill the shopping void left by the Naturalist and De Colores and Bower Bird. As of March 1st, 2010 Magpie Plaza will be open for business at http://www.magpieplaza.com.

When the Naturalist closed we wondered where we would find unique, ecofriendly, handmade, and local products. Then we realized we could make our own little downtown online. So were creating a naturethemed gift shop, an international/Indigenous/fair trade shop, and a cottagechic boutique. Please enjoy browsing each minishop! Were building this up, little by little and starting with local artisans/artists, and hope to offer a great selection and the best customer care possible. Please visit our page and check back often, as many items are oneofa kind!

Weve named our virtual plaza after the Yellowbilled Magpies that are unique to our region and that, after population decimation due to West Nile virus, are making a comeback. We wanted a symbol of local specialties, and we cant help but love these clever guys for getting through tough times. Users/kering
