The Next Chapter has closed.   Borders / Amazon and other uses for entertainment dollars meant that even in the lower rent of Downtown Woodland, they still had too much debt to continue.  A quiet and sad end to a wonderful store.

The Next Chapter was once located in Davis at 225 G. St., but moved to Woodland soon after the opening of Davis Commons and Borders Books. The Next Chapter was an independent bookstore that offers membership which provides varying levels of benefits. The store also sold coffee and bagels. They sold new and used books and will also help customers search for outofprint books. Teachers received a 15% discount on purchases over $25 (20% discount over $500) for books to be used in the classroom. There was a very cozy sitting area on the second floor with a nice view of Main Street.

The Next Chapter also hosted a variety of book discussions, author presentations, and even music performances.

Tickets for the Palms Playhouse could also be purchased here.


If anyone remembers exactly where the Next Chapter was located in Davis and when exactly it moved please put it up! Users/JimSchwab
