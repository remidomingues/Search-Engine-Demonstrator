Second, start watching the movie.

Now, heres the important part: Watch Nicholas Cage closely. Every time he looks perplexed, TAKE A SHOT.

Whoever makes it the longest wins! (its pretty tough to make it through the whole film)

Or, you can play alone. When you pass out, you win! But its less pathetic with at least one friend.

(btw, read the warning at the top of Drinking games. Nicholas Cage doesnt like it when you get alcohol poisoning..)
