Using an asr10 as a canvas, samples as paint, drum loops as brushes, The Nothing blends JAZZ, classical, and world beat influences and creates HIP HOP BEATS that are musical works of art. Following in the same vein as RJD2 and hailing from Davis, CA (hometown of fellow artist DJ SHADOW), Matt Fisher, aka: The Nothing, was raised on jazz and blues. At 13 he found hiphop and never looked back, spending his adolescence with HIEROGLYPHICS, TRIBE, DE LA SOUL, and KRS ONE.
  
Now THE NOTHING has hooked up with likeminded artists all with one goal: making music simply for the love of it.  Fisher has been lucky enough to work with one of underground hiphops best: LUCKYIAM.PSC of the LIVING LEGENDS.  PSC used seven of The Nothings beats for his 2003 release EXTRA CREDIT 2: SUMMER SCHOOL. This album boasted a roster of underground greats such as DJ DSTYLES of the World Famous BEAT JUNKIES, and emcees ACEYALONE and THE GROUCH, both of whom  appear on The Nothing track The Wise.  With his first solo release THE NOTHING has taken his multifaceted background and woven it into a soothing DOWNTEMPO musical experience.
