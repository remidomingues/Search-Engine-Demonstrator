The Nut Tree is a great place to go and have a relaxing experience riding the train or the Merrygoround.  It even has a rollercoaster and some great arcade games. Just a short drive from Davis to Vacaville and the fun is waiting for you.

The park closed in 1996, and had been reopened since 10/20/2006, only to close again in Early 2009, and reappear in a tiny courtyard in August of the same year.

Users/StevenDaubert thinks its a shame that the nut tree is a blatant strip mall now. He thought the old version was cooler.

Some places of possible interest to Davisites include Fentons Creamery, Sees Candies, a Jelly Belly store (more convenient than the Jelly Belly Factory), and Amicis East Coast Pizzeria.
