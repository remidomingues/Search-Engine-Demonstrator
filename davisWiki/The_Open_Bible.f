The Open Bible was a Spiritual Organizations Christian Bookstores bookstore. The owner, Ken, also runs Kens Bike & Ski, but the two are otherwise unrelated.  The Open Bible is closed.

As of today (1/15/2009) theyve started a Going Out Of Business sale. They sent a direct mail piece to a number of addresses; no word of exactly why, or what future plans are for the site. But the front window is covered with neon pink and green posterboards, and going out of business sale announcements!

Some Christian bookstores just have Protestant, or even just conservative/creationist materials, but this one has a range, including Catholic things, plus just about every version of the Christian Bible there is.  They have Spanish language publications, music, gift items & greeting cards..  They have bibles in many other languages & will order books on request.

They carry a wide range of music, and keep a Top 10 listing in 7 categories:  Praise & Worship, Contemporary, Rock/Alternative, Gospel/Urban, Southern Gospel, Rap, & Instrumental. and a good selection of childrens music.  They also have a fun listening station that helps you find CDs, artists, songs.  Plus, they have movies for the whole family (including Veggietales)  and what might be the cheapest cup of coffee in town.

20090116 10:42:40 nbsp Ok, so I guess now that it is public knowledge, I can say that I will be sad to see this place go.  Bogeys, then Next Chapter, and now Open Bible...whats next?! Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20090116 11:11:33 nbsp Borders is in severe financial trouble... Users/IDoNotExist

20090212 17:45:24 nbsp When I first saw the signs I was saddened, too, and stopped in to see if there was anything I could use for upcoming events.  When it came time to pay for my things, I was reminded why I had stopped shopping there. The same employee that helped me previously was there this time. The cashier was just as careless and rude, like I was taking up her time bothering to pay for my things. If their sales werent final I would have returned it all.  What a waste!  Its too bad, but frankly, Id rather spend my money somewhere that appreciates my business.   Users/miggle
