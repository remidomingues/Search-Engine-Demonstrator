The Pantry at Davis is a studentrun food bank housed in the basement of Lower Freeborn Hall Lower Freeborn, Room 21. It exists to provide food and basic necessities to UC Davis students, and to ensure that no student will be forced to choose between food and college costs. Items are distributed on a point system, and students can receive up to 3 points of items per day. The result of a collaboration between ASUCD, the Community Advising Network under Counseling and Psychological Services, and the Office of the Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs, The Pantry runs primarily on donations from the campus community and various food banks around Yolo County. It is open to any student with a valid UC Davis I.D. The distribution is anonymous, and staff members do not record any information about students.

The menu for the Pantry changes every week depending on inventory and donations, but here is a list of the products that are typically offered:
