Before Froggys, there was another bar at the corner called The Paragon. It had a superb wooden patio extending into the street; though looking back, its surpising more people didnt get hurt since patrons used to sit on the rails. There was also a card room in the basement. It was a very popular bar and a good place to debate football with the bartenders. Their kitchen was where Sophia, of Sophias Thai Kitchen fame, got her start. It was the first establishment to introduce Thai Restaurants Thai food to the general Davis populace.

On their patio, a UC Davis student named David Thornton was doing the birthday ritual 21 for 21 (consuming 21 drinks/shots). This contributed to his tragic events tragic death, and Paragon was given a lot of the blame for not properly supervising its patio area and for continuing to serve him alcohol beyond his ability to handle it.  This is despite http://archives.higheredcenter.org/hecnews/events/000414a.html the fact that an autopsy and toxicology analysis found he had alcohol, cocaine, marijuana and Naproxen, an antiinflammatory drug, in his system at the time he died.   Nonetheless, David had a bloodalcohol level of .54  lethally high.  A level of .40 is considered the LD50, or median http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_alcohol_content#Effects_at_different_levels lethal dose.

Ultimately, The Paragon http://www.dui.com/duilibrary/california/news/serversarrested was forced to get rid of the patio and lost its liquor license.  Criminal charges also were filed against a Paragon bartender and waitress, though a jury later acquitted both.

The property was sold to the owners of Froggys.
