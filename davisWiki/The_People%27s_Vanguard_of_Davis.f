The Peoples Vanguard of Davis (http://davisvanguard.org/ link) is a political blogs blog that was launched in July 2006.  It is dedicated to exposing what it calls the dark underbelly of the Peoples Republic of Davis by writing about things that arent completely reported in the Davis Enterprise mainstream press.  Its updated daily with news, opinions, and commentary focusing on politics in Davis and environs, with occasional forays onto the state and national stages. It also features Yolo Judicial Watch, a section devoted to the activities of the judiciary in Yolo County and the surrounding areas.

The blog is written by David Greenwald (no relation to former councilmember Sue Greenwald), who uses the pen name Doug Paul Davis (DPD) online.  He remained anonymous for the first several months after the blog launched, using only his pen name.  He finally identified himself as the author in a January 2007 Sacramento Bee article.

The initial focus of the blog was to comment on the activities of the Davis Police Department (the other DPD).  Greenwald has written about why hes deliberately http://davisvanguard.org/index.php?optioncom_content&viewarticle&id428:commentarywhenfairandbalancedislessaccurate&catid56:davisenterprise&Itemid82 biased, saying it gives more freedom than if there were an expectation of unbiased writing.  Users/TomGarberson Critics find the bias excessive in that it sometimes leads to the presentation of only those facts supporting the authors viewpoint.  The omission of not only the opposing viewpoint (which is fine) but also facts that dont fit the authors opinion is intellectually dishonest.  Users/CovertProfessor Others think that whereas the point of view being presented is clear, that facts that support other points of view are presented.

On March 2, 2009, the Vanguard moved from the blogger server to its own server and a new web address, davisvanguard.org.  It added new features such as the Community Blogs that allow select members of the public to post their own comments. They also had a radio show on KDRT 95.7 FM (archives http://peoplesvanguard.com/ here). Registration is required to post comments. Pseudonyms are allowed. The comments are moderated.


Greenwald states that he started the blog in July 2006 in response to the City Council disbanding the Human Relations Commission and the treatment of Halema Buzayan.  He finally made the plunge in late July to create a place where people can get news not being reported in the Enterprise.  Its intended for the progressive left, highlighting whats happening in Davis among the elected and unelected government.  The site took off and gets thousands of weekly hits and breaks news stories ahead of the mainstream press.  Some stories are indeed covered in far more detail than the mainstream press; recent examples include the budget situation and the city council election.



Excellent, that was a good article, and Im sure it will enlighten a few mature davisites as to what the wiki is. Ive been pondering ways to get Davisites aware of the wiki, this does a great job albeit unintentionally.  Users/StevenDaubert
     Steven, I dont see it as unintentional on my part.  Part of the reason I wanted to do the interview with Philip was to honor his great achievement and expose an audience to the Wiki, who have in many cases only heard of it.  The big role that the Vanguard tries to play is an educational role in this community.   Users/DavidGreenwald

20070913 11:49:18 nbsp Im unimpressed about your truancy series. I fail to find an issue that is noteworthy inside of them. If kids chose to cut class enough, the police will always get involved. Having known Pam Mari for the vast majority of my life, both personally and when she was an administrator at Holmes / DHS. Thru this knowledge of her, I can safely say she has the kids well being at heart, ahead of covering her ass or the districts.

long rant short: Whats the problem? I can tell you first hand how easy it was to walk off DHS campus as a student, at any time, despite the fact its an open campus only at lunch. Users/StevenDaubert

20070913 13:18:45 nbsp Start with the issue that she implemented this policy without authority from the school board and as a result the policy has been terminated.  Start with the issue that no one in the community who had any sort of direct accountability to the voters had any knowledge of what was going on.  Do you really fail to understand the importance of this?  Even Officer Pytel acknowledged that this was a problem.  Policy decisions need to be made primarily by office holders who are elected not unelected administrators.  As I suggest in todays article, the community was uninformed and did not weigh in on this, as a result this has been a huge mess with mass confusion. Users/DavidGreenwald

20070914 13:10:15 nbsp Whats so wrong with Pam Mari making calls like this? She lived in Davis for a long time, and had plenty of time not only being an administrator but teaching classes as well... Kids choose to be truant, no one forces them to cut class. Sure they are putting themselves behind in work, but at the time you dont notice the consequences of truancy. Kids need to to at least make it thru high school... Whats so atrocious about the policy in the first place? Users/StevenDaubert

             Whats wrong with Pam Mari taking the lead on this?  She didnt inform the school board and they are the ones that set district policy.  Im not necessarily opposed the policy in the first place, but the process was completely messed up. Users/DavidGreenwald

20070914 13:34:20 nbsp hehehehe, being a relatively new high school alum, its interesting noticing how my attitude shifts. When I was going to DHS having a friend with a car that you pile into and is one of the most awesome things. Now when I go around DHS at lunch time I notice the general tomfollery, the lack of seatbelts, etc that gets people concerned. XI have quite a bit to say about the student interviews, but I dont have the timeX. When I started reading I thought what I would have done in each situation. I would have avoided all the tickets. Users/StevenDaubert
     enjoy:

Here is what you say to the officer if he hasnt Flashed red and blue lights, or given you a direct lawful order: Officer, this consensual encounter is over.

tada, officer has to issue a citation, Officer cant issue driving for under a year citation as the primary issue on the citation.

I knew this when I went to DHS a couple hears ago... Having to dodge the Traffic cops on the BMWs, etc.

For the female student to not say the above opens herself up legally for the citation, and thats all our friend Jeff Resig cares about, the citation will fly in court due to said students actions, and thats all the system cares about, the end.

However, If she though she was a victim of profiling, and had just realized it was foolish to admit to committing a crime to a officer, she could have gotten his badge number, and demanded to speak to a watch commander. This is a request the officer has to take seriously, and the watch commander is the one responsible for the interpretation of the law. Female student explains to watch commander that she felt it violated the law that the officer was engaging her solely to figure out if she was driving under a year, which is a violation, but its supposed to be only a secondary check, and it isnt reason to pull a car over in the first place.

For Soren the same thing applies, Ive had an officer pull up behind me while Ive been parked on the street near South D Safeway, I made the mistake of trying to deal with it hesitantly, and wound up searched and the whole nine, despite the fact that I never explicitly gave permission.

Know what you can and cant do in police encounters, cause quick wits will save you tons of hassle.

Did Drew and Mohamed have a note from the teacher, and the appropriate note to be off campus? If so tell the officer to sod off via asking for a watch commander and explaining your situation. Officers are just the foot soldiers who blindly enforce policy, whenever a conflict arises they will ask the watch commander how to act, if its okay to kick in this door cause I know there is an occupant who is ignoring me? or is this a bad stop? etc. However if they lacked the appropriate set of passes and notes, and the officer detained them and took them back to DHS, and then threw them a curve ball to see how they take it, thats to be expected. Its just another day in the life for said officer, and thats the routine. Dont expect cops to be nice to you when they suspect you of doing something.

It doesnt default to the officers to make sure the students understand when they can and cant speak. I have zero sympathy for any of the students mentioned, simply for the fact that all you have to do is sign up for the citizens police academy, happens twice a year, and DPD tells you how they work on a day to day basis. Thats more than enough information to be armed with, and what makes it best is that it comes STRAIGHT FROM THE HORSES MOUTH.

If you make it understood your watching whats going on, and are going to kick and scream in all the right ways, most officers simply dont want to deal with the hassle... Im sorry if this seems discombobulated, or fragmented, I just banged this out freewrite style >_< Im sure its all just one big run on sentence.

20080208 18:41:48 nbsp Response to a deleted comment about why some names were just last names and others full names.  When I started the blog there were no labels, that feature was added later on.  The first few labels I did, I just put peoples last names.  Then after I wrote about Sue Greenwald, I obviously could not just call her Greenwald, so then I put everyones label as first and last name as added.  But I never went back and changed the old ones and it would take too long to do it now.  So thats it is the way it is. Users/DavidGreenwald

20081118 08:48:38 nbsp Re Officer Fehers arrest in Sacramento:  Im all for giving people second chances, but what jumps out at me here is that he misrepresented himself and lied to the arresting officers.  First, by trying to get away with saying he worked for YONET (thats a special task force, btw) and then for saying he worked for BNE.  And he didnt come clean.  It was later that Sac PD discovered that Davis PD was his employer.

Seems to me that reinstatement should be contingent upon some sort of alcohol treatment program.  There are signs of addiction here.

And btw:  He hasnt learned anything working as a police officer?  When you are under arrest, keep your mouth shut! After giving hundreds and hundreds of Miranda warnings, he doesnt know this yet??!!

20100214 17:45:26 nbsp Its interesting reading about the history of this Peoples blogsite; in reality, this blogsite is for selected people of Davis, namely, those who dont blog about Davids pal and wifes political crony Bill Ritter.

Case in point, as of yesterday, I was officially banned from blogging on the Vanguard. Unlike many others, I blogged with my real name and real email address, because I believe in being honest about my views regarding political issues in our great town. I comanaged (on a volunteer basis) the No on P campaign last fall against the proposed Wildhorse Ranch development, which we won with an astounding 75% of the vote. Davids pal, Bill Ritter, was the paid campaign manager by Parlin Development, and he did as a remarkable favor by running a horrible campaign (any of you remember all those goofy Yes on P mailers, if not, they are documented on this site.)

Any ways, yesterday David posted a story on the Vanguard about the CHA (Choices for Healthy Aging) group and their efforts behind supporting a seniorsonly development at the old Covell Village site. I had blogged in response to a previous blogger that this sounded a lot like a Really Grey campaign, similar to Bill Ritters Really Green campaign for Measure P, and to watch out for all the mailers coming our way with pictures of happy healthy seniors having picnics, lawn bowling, going on hay rides, etc, and perhaps the developers should hire Ritter. I NEVER used any profanity or any derogatory terms against Bill Ritter. David edited this (and all of my subsequent blogs), and sent me an email basically admonishing me of no more personal attacks against Bill Ritter, or I would be banned, to which I told him basically to shove it, and I still believe in the First Amendment when it comes to political opinion sites. I have now been banned; if I chose to use my real name and real email, which so few of his bloggers do, I am not able to post comments on the Vanguard. Are there any other banned bloggers out there? or do I have the honor of being the first.

This is what the Peoples Vanguard is all about, it is a selective site, which appears to filter the opinions, no different than the fair and balanced FOX News! Users/GregSokolov
 Thanks for posting about this, its great to have various points of view on various sites. Would you say the First Amendment applies just as well to political letters to the editor of a newspaper not being printed at the choice of the editor though? Is David in a similar position on the Vanguard? I dont expect private media like a newspaper or the Vanguard and certainly not FOX News to be fair and balanced. I dont really want them to be either, I think its reasonable to get information from multiple sources (like you posting here on the wiki) and form my own opinions. For more information about the explicit biases of the Vanguard, see http://davisvanguard.org/index.php?optioncom_content&viewarticle&id428:commentarywhenfairandbalancedislessaccurate&catid56:davisenterprise&Itemid82 Commentary: When Fair and Balanced is Less Accurate Users/NickSchmalenberger

20100214 19:48:32 nbsp Hi Nick, thanks for your insightful reply and historical reference to prior Vanguard opinion about fair and balanced (very interesting to say the least!) My main point regarding free speech and the Peoples Vanguard is simply to highlight the utter hypocrisy of David Greenwald (and his lack of credibility) when it comes to peripheral growth issues. In the Wildhorse Ranch election, he was clearly on the side of more development, and now with Covell Village Senior City, he is incensed at the whole really grey campaign being waged by developerbacked CHA group; and why the radical divergence in his views (literally only three months post Wildhorse Ranch)? Bill Ritter. I blog about it, using my full real name and email, and use no profanity, derogatory language and I get axed it. Why? Because perhaps I struck a sensitive nerve in his political body and he deems it personal attack; eerily similar to the way OReilly gets all defensive and cuts people off (watch his latest interview with Jon Stewart as a great example). David apparently has no backbone when it comes to hardcore analysis of his ever shifting views on growth issues, and has resorted to banning folks. Since I assume my views are safe at Davis Wiki, I will continue to bring up these issues to the Davis citizenry. Users/GregSokolov
 I agree that David Greenwalds blog takes definite stands on particular issues  but surely you dont think that one cant be against a particular development while for another?  I say this as someone who voted no on P and who isnt crazy about this new Senior City proposal, either.  But they are different proposals with different pros and cons; I can see supporting one and not the other.  As for his banning of you, its hard to judge that without knowing the exact content of what you wrote.   Users/CovertProfessor

20100214 21:29:19 nbsp I strongly disagree about the public nature of the Enterprise editorial page. I think the Enterprise and most papers are biased, although the Enterprise tries to hide it more than the Winters Express for example. I think that the Express has a more interesting editorial page because of its bias. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20100214 22:55:21 nbsp To CovertProfessor:

I blogged essentially that if Covell Village II was to be defeated (as both I and David Greenwald agree upon it should), perhaps Bill Ritter should be hired to run their campaign, and do as awful a job as he did for Yes on P. I then followed that comment with additional comment asking David to explain his differences only three months later in opposing Covell Village Senior City, in the face of his recent support for Wildhorse Ranch. THATS IT!!! That is what he construed as personal attacks; I guess when he called Bob Dunning vile and depraved for his humorous comments on paid college students during the Measure P, that was not personal; its only when it is directed towards his political crony Bill Ritter, that it becomes personal, By the way,  I have heard rumors that David and Cecilia Greenwald still owe Bill Ritter about $30,000 from her failed City Council bid in 2008; makes one wonder if David is paying him back by erasing all negative comments about him on his blog site...some free speech! Its all bought and paid for, like any other news site! Users/GregSokolov

20100516 06:21:44 nbsp Made my first visit to the Vanguard today and read it for several hours. The vanguard is:
      Extremely biased: Greenwald presents his opinions completely without acknowledgment to dissenting opinions of any kind, let alone going so far as including a quote to allow one of his targets to defend themselves. Each article is written from a position of absolute metaphysical certainty. (a prime example, 42yearold homeless being stomped on by the DA, but his domestic burglary charge remains comfortably unexplained)
      Extremely poor: Ive seen some shoddy editing standards in my day but this is ridiculous.
      Confusing and uninformative: The average article refers to other past events without explanation or crosslinking of any kind.
      Interesting: Does a good job bringing issues to light for further research from less biased sources.
      Sensationalist: Guilt is commutatively applied to broad swaths of individuals or organizations in public positions based on the testimony of interviewees with hazy or missing credentials but never once leveled at any person not of public standing in any way however brief or insignificant.

I appreciate GregSokolovs position that the Vanguard is similar to FOX news. The techniques used to mislead readers in the Vanguard are very similar to those used by They, our most auspicious indoctrination organization. Users/khabok

20100517 05:06:53 nbsp I obviously havent read this page in awhile.  I dont want to get into Sokolovs post, needless to say, he presents a onesided view of the reason he was banned.  In fact, he doesnt state, and apparently doesnt know why he was banned.  Weve been trying to crack down on posts that lead to titfortat fights, I asked him to tone it down, he responded by telling me not to contact him anymore and telling me that I was being put on spam block. At that point, I had little choice but to ban him, since he was unwilling to cooperate in our efforts to change the tone of posting.

He posts this: I have heard rumors that David and Cecilia Greenwald still owe Bill Ritter about $30,000 from her failed City Council bid in 2008.  This is just untrue.  We have not paid Bill Ritter nor do we owe Bill Ritter anything.  I suggest that should be taken down as unfounded gossip.

Khabok:  Thanks for your post.  I agree with you on the editing issues, we have tried to address them, but unfortunately it is still largely one person produce a mountain load of content.  Biased?  Certainly.  Although your example has an explanation, the domestic burglary charge was from over 20 years ago, Im not sure what you wanted there, the information was not readily available on it and probably not all that relevant to a case of vandalism.  I agree I could probably do better on background information, crosslinking would be helpful, Ill try to do better with that.  I have no idea what youre trying to say on your last point.  Feel free to contact me if you have some specific suggestions. Users/DavidGreenwald

20100518 06:19:26 nbsp ah, this sort of thing is much easier when you can address people directly.

Weve been trying to crack down on posts  does it really matter what you choose to follow that statement with?

I have heard rumors that David and Cecilia Greenwald still owe Bill Ritter about $30,000 from her failed City Council bid in 2008.  he says hes heard rumors to that effect.  Do you have definitive information that hes heard no such rumors?

he was unwilling to cooperate in our efforts to change the tone of posting.  If his posts have a tasteless tone let his readership speak for itself, thats how democratic information functions.  Personally, I believe most people in this town are very crude and pointlessly antagonistic, but if thats the truth should we take the roll of cultural exemplars and try to hide it?

I agree with you on the editing issues  good.  Id love to respect the Vanguard, I was quite excited when I found it.  Hey, Ill be happy to edit it for you if you like, just dont be surprised to get back a lot of notes like explain this idea or what does the opposition say about this.

Im not sure what you wanted there  to not have to WONDER whos place he broke into, what he took, why you wont tell me and whether youre asking me to feel sorry for some sort of really awful scumbag.  I cant begin to tell you the experiences Ive had with street kids (sorry, homeless people) in this area and Id love to know what the DA knows about him.

I have no idea what youre trying to say on your last point  that its really easy to jump down the throat of an organization without talking about why they do what they do.  Your treatment of the Buzayan incident, for instance.  Among the long list of people whove tried to make me upset about the Buzayan familys situation, youve done the least to explain that idea to me, yet you reference that arrest offhand in other articles the way one might mention the Holocaust: as a token worstpossiblething to end debate before it starts.

oh by the way, your article Are Recent Shootings A Sign of Things To Come or an Aberration from last October.  First of all, thanks for actually covering all those incidents.  Second, have a free anonymous tip, the problem was coke traffic but it should be over now. Users/khabok

20100518 09:15:08 nbsp khabok:

We made a decision that the tone of the comment section was too antagonistic and it was driving away people who otherwise might participate, so we have made a concerted effort to change the tone.  Some people naturally disagree with our editorial/ moderation decisions, usually we can talk it through.  This was the only case to date where that has not worked.

As to the rumor, there is no doubt in my mind that hes heard it, but my understanding of wiki policies is that this is not a place to post unsubstantiated rumors.  It is completely false and therefore zero basis to it.  We never borrow nor paid money to the individual in question.

Finally, it was a 1989 burglary case, 21 years ago, information not readily available and not especially pertinent to the case.  Why is the guy an awful scumbag, he has bipolar disorder?  Thats really the important information, why is the DAs office trying to use three strikes on a guy that their own psychiatrists are saying is mentally ill and was when he committed a relatively minor crime, actually two relatively minorcrimes?

Ive written extensively on the Buzayan case, do a search and you can find the background information.  Maybe at some point we can do backlinks, but thats not practical right now. Users/DavidGreenwald

20100518 12:36:57 nbsp Since when are personal comments of any kind part of the operation of a typical wiki?  If that opinion or belief exists, that is informational.  If you assert it is untrue, that is ALSO informational.  If morality in this area isnt interesting to you, how about this: deleting his post makes you look really guilty.

If you think I was implying that the mentallyill man in question is in actual fact a scumbag, youre once again completely missing the point.  Incomplete information is just one more way to be evasive and for anyone reading critically youve severely undermined your credibility because of it.  Also poor for your credibility is making your point in the form of a question.  This isnt jeopardy.  When you ask why is the DAs office trying to etcetera I personally start formulating possible answers, of which there are many.  Not everything about a person is a matter of public record.  Care to address real possibilities in your next article?

I know you covered the background of the Buzayan case.  I know where your search bar is and I like to know what Im talking about before I start. Users/khabok
  Actually, most wikis have plenty of personal opinion.  It wasnt until Wikipedia appeared that the concept of NPOV was connected to wikis.  Alas, since its since become one of the most well known wikis, the two things are connected in peoples minds.  A wiki is a good community platform to have an open, public discussion about allegations and gather facts from multiple people.  With tactful presentation, even very serious allegations can be presented and either laid to rest or supported by fact and witnesses.  A good example is the currently evolving Con Artists entry  talk of a local scam has slowly accrued multiple sources and confirmation, including a photo. As the information is gathered, it can be refactored into a concise and clear whole, presenting the many aspects that a multitude of people have contributed.   Cooperative editing, when handled well, is an amazingly powerful and insightful method of presenting issues. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
  I would concur wholeheartedly with the previous statement Daubert

20100603 08:48:54 nbsp I havent come back to these posts in a long time, too busy watching David Greenwalds hypocrisy on the whole Ruth AsmundsonVergis political affairs; where his outrage towards Asmundson last July when she let Parlin Developers essentially pick an election date for Measure P ballot? Is it because his political puppeteer Bill Ritter was hired by Parlin to help influence the City Council?

Thanks Khabok for your independent analysis of the Peoples Vanguard; I wish that more people (you have not been censured by David yet) continue to do the same.

In his feeble explanation to you why I was banned, he failed to mention a statement in his email to me which prompted my reply and statement to him that I would spam all of his future replies.

He basically said Measure P is over; you won, get over it; to which I replied, although the election had passed, the key principles and players on the Yes on P side (i.e. Ritter) remain alive and need to be questioned in subsequent issues (i.e. how is that only five months later after Measure P, the outrage over the Covell Village redux project is suddenly all about bad development and unneccessary growth, when Wildhorse Ranch was so necessary?)

The rumors about $30 K they owe Ritter came to me from some very well informed people in local politics...whether it is a large amount of money or something else, the relationship between Ritter and the Greenwalds clearly influences his opinions and those of others who he decides to characterize as negative on his Peoples blog site. Users/GregSokolov

20100603 12:43:46 nbsp To Khabok:

I am gald you brought up the whole Buzayan case again. Ask David Greenwald how much Mr. Buzayan (father) has donated to the Vangaurd since that case???

Also, Mr. Buzayan lives in South Davis, near the new proposed development at Willowbank. SURPRISE, SURPRISE David Greenwald was outraged at the City Council for approving the Willowbank project and wrote many blogs about it.

What, I ask, is the difference between Willowbank (a much smaller project away from major roadways or school) vs. Wildhorse Ranch (larger project which would led to increased traffic on Covell Blvd nearby the Harper Junior High)??? The answer: NO Bill Ritter hired by Willowbank developers and Buzayan lives in South Davis and not Wildhorse. Users/GregSokolov
