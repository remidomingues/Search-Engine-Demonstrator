Fair trade and delicious!  Pepper Peddler Coffee uses a Bicycles bicycle powered coffee roaster and then sell their coffee by subscription.  Freshlyroasted coffee is delivered directly to your doorstep in Davis by bicycle on Friday (either weekly or biweekly).  The coffee comes in Kerr jars which they Recycling reuse.  When you first open it, it makes an exciting pop! and releases the tantalizing aroma of super fresh coffee (roasted the night before delivery)!

The Pepper Peddler offers four roasts: light, medium, special dark, and a blend.  In addition to bicycle delivery to your door, the blend and the dark roast are available in the bulk food section at the Davis Food Coop Davis Food Coop.

20090703 12:55:05 nbsp Im a Pepper Peddler addict. I havent signed up for the delivery service but I buy some from the bulk foods section at the coop every week. Its delicious and always fresh because its roasted every week. The date it was roasted on is written right on the bin and they replace it every week with the new blend. It really is a treat for coffee lovers. Users/condemned2bfree

20100219 17:21:48 nbsp I must say this is THE BEST coffee I have ever had, I like the light roast. I have given this coffee to a lot of people and everyone has said it is very good. Users/DagonJones

20100816 13:57:36 nbsp The coffee is excellent and the concept is AWESOME.  Pricing is very good, delivery is convenient and your karma is clean from not supporting corporate coffee.  What could be better? Users/browneyedblues

20110603 10:17:34 nbsp When is Pepper Peddlers delivery area ever going to expand to Sacramento? About time some delivery bikers shook up the coffee wars over here. Of course, for midtown deliveries you might want to design some sustainable styrofoam armorpadding for your cute Mason jars. Users/RaoulDuke

20120808 16:52:56 nbsp I recently bought a pound of the Special Dark roast from the Davis Food CoOp and made it for the first time today, just using a French press. It was AWESOME, and I ended up drinking the rest of the 24 oz of which I had originally intended to chill for iced coffee later on....whoops! Im pretty picky when it comes to coffeethis stuff is up there with Temple Coffee in Sac, yet more affordable :). Users/EmilyHughes
