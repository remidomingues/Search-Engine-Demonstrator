20120613 09:32:53 nbsp Kristine is a wonderful pet sitter. She is reliable, attentive, and conscientious.  Kristine has been training and walking our puppy for the past year and she has greatly improved with obiediance control. Our puppy is a sweet, easily overexcitable lab golden mix and Kristine has helped her learn to control herself while still letting her fun personality shine. Kristine uses positive reinforcement and is full of ideas to make life for the pet and owner comfortable. I highly recommend Kristine to help you with your pet! Users/HanoverResident

20121102 02:45:41 nbsp Kristine is amazing!  We always have her watch our pets when we are out of town.  She is highly trained and always goes out of her way to make sure that our pets are well taken care of.  We ave two dogs and a cat.  Our cat can be a bit tempermental with people she does not know but Kristine makes the extra effort to make sure Cookie is doing well and is happy. I have reccomended her to friends and I could not imagine using someone else.   Users/rmk734

20140618 16:16:48 nbsp I am so lucky to have found Kristine!  We have been using her for a couple of years and she is always reliable, knowledgeable, helpful and positive. Besides our older dog, we have a 4 month old lab puppy that she cares for (and trains during her visits).  We use her when I am unable to be home during the day and also when we are out of town.  It is so reassuring to have Kristine watching our pets.  If you need someone to care for your pets, I highly recommend her. Users/PattiF
