It is also quite pricey (more than $10 for the pictured jar at the Coop).  But perhaps that is what it costs to make something with such an intensive process. So, it makes for a nice local gift or a special treat.  Note that it contains coconut oil, and that you can taste the coconut.  Whether this is a bug or a feature is probably in the eye of the beholder.  I rather liked it. Users/CovertProfessor
