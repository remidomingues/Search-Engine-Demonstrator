The Pit is the large, bowlshaped depression on the west face Wellman Hall on the UC Davis campus. One goes down into The Pit by stairs or a ramp from the outside, or by exiting from the basement floor in Wellman. There is no other way to get into the basement of Wellman from the outside, or to go outside from the basement.

In the OLDEN DAYS, which is to say the BEFORE TIME, it was impossible to get cellphone reception from address(the Pit of Wellman., 38.541263, 121.751749)  Technology has since progressed.

Occasionally, you may run into some Cirque du Perdue crazy people who play rock, paper, and scissors a lot here.

The Pit has a really strong Moobilenet connection, so its great for chilling and using the net.

The Whole Earth Festival rave was held here since at least 2005.
