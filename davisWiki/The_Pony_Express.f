The Pony Express predates the telegraph as the fastest method of postal service communication in operation between 1860 and 1861. Young unmarried men (often orphans) in their late teens and twenties were sought as ridersofficial messengersto deliver the post via horseback. The entirety of the Pony Express route was 1,900 miles and spanned several states, its westmost posts being Sacramento and San Francisco. According to the pictured station marker, located everso slightly south of the Davis Arboretum path heading west near the UC Davis welcome sign as one enters campus heading toward the Food Science building and the Mondavi Center, a Pony Express station once existed in Yolo/Solano County as a gobetween from the station in Old Sacramento and the one in SF.
