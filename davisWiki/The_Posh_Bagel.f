Some of the sandwiches use cream cheese creatively, for instance the BLTCC. A variety of fruit salads (sliced melons and berries) are also available. It appears to be family owned, and they are very friendly.


They also serve Java City coffee, which you might like better than the Starbucks coffee next door. They also have various milk teas and Thai tea with optional tapioca pearls. Though the tapioca drinks are a little more expensive than average, the coffee drinks are quite a bit cheaper than the equivalent at Starbucks and other nearby coffee shops.

In April 2007, they revamped their menu, getting rid of the hot sandwiches category completely, but adding many new sandwiches overall.  The price of almost all sandwiches increased by over a dollar (it also used to be cheaper on a bagel than on a roll  now its the same price).  The average sandwich now costs $5 to $6, and they no longer offer the meal combo (chips and drink at a reduced price).

They accept cash and credit cards, with a Credit Card minimum purchase $3.00 minimum on the latter.

Although not free, you can get a clear WiFi Hot Spots WiFi signal from the Starbucks next door.

The Posh Bagel was previously Brueggers Bakery & Cafe and Main St. Bagel. If you go back to the bathrooms, there are still original Brueggers posters on the wall, one of which seems awfully confused as to what bagel place it is advertising.  The Posh Bagel is a chain, with stores in places such as San Franciscos wiki:sf:the Sunset sunset.

There are a small but growing number of people who call the place Pork Bagel because the Posh in painted sign in the window looks like it says Pork.


20050926 12:13:54 nbsp I recommend their Pineapple croissants, and their jalapeno cream cheese. Users/RyanCastellucci

20050926 12:20:42 nbsp Their Eggwich breakfast bagels are good as well, though you might wanna order it without butter. Users/RyanCastellucci

20051116 17:14:16 nbsp I got a green tea latte tapioca drink.  It was chalky, tasted like white chocolate, and was overly sweet.  The boba were mushy.  Yech.  I did not finish the drink. Users/JudithTruman

20051220 10:42:38 nbsp What I really like about this place is not the food they serve. They have the greatest selection of drinks! They have Orangina, and Naked Fruit ... it just makes me happy. SS

20060219 15:36:29 nbsp I do NOT recommend this place. Brueggers used to be much MUCH better. The pastries tend to be stale and the bagels arent that good. Much better to go to the COOP for frech bagles. Other than Noahs there arent decent bagel places in town anymore! :( Users/LookyLoo

20060306 16:55:20 nbsp Marinara Bagel with Tomato Basil cream cheese.  Best bagel in the history of the world. Users/ZacMorris

20060312 13:05:08 nbsp I had to wait in line for a while but I thought it was well worth it.  I ordered a Eggwich with ham and enjoyed it.  Filled me up D and Im happy with the price. Users/JoAnnaRich

20060322 21:34:19 nbsp They have mini bagels. awesome stuff! Users/PattyLouieJunior

20060403 09:56:59 nbsp The eggwich bagels are super (especially on an asiago bagel), though I second the recommendation to either skip the butter or tell them to go light on it.  The bubble drinks are not great, but the chai tea is some of the best Ive had. Users/AlexPomeranz

20061014 01:04:47 nbsp The muffins and many of the other pastries look suspiciously like they came from Costco. My wife once ordered a blueberry bagel that had a blueish tint, but not a single blueberry.  She was not offered a refund or another bagel.  So overall its a disappointment, but the eggwiches are pretty good.   Users/MatthewPearson
   I used to think the same thing, but I saw an employee scooping batter into muffin tins one day, indicating that at least some of the muffins are likely made inhouse. Users/AnnaJones

20061015 15:51:38 nbsp I second the EggWich praise; the butter makes it better, IMO Users/TerryMcConnell

20061216 22:36:57 nbsp I love their Dutch cruch rolls.  The only thing I buy here (but quite often) is the SubClub Sandwich (turkey, avocado, cheese) on a Dutch Crunch Roll.  mmmmmmm. Good. Users/PeterAnselmo

20070612 20:45:41 nbsp My absolute favorite sandwich is the turkey and cranberry. The sprouts and pickles and cucumbers are an awesome combination, and they always serve you with a smile. I used to like Nugget best, but this has beaten it out. Users/DanielHill

20070622 20:13:27 nbsp Good sandwiches, very good breakfast sandwiches, and they have Vietnamese coffee.   Users/MisterProfessor

20070903 08:21:56 nbsp The Lite Lox should be called the Lox Less Monster I see small chunks in there and its kind of pink, but theres not enough to survive scientific scrutiny. I was kind of wondering why it was so cheap. They should raise the price and add some more salmon. Id pay for it. Users/CraigBrozinsky

20071014 03:17:17 nbsp The operators of this place are very nice, even when it is busy.  I dont go all that often, but it is one of the only togo breakfast places in town (besides the 8:45am snack truck at BigO tires then 9:00am at cablecar wash).  I like how I can order an eggwich hold the cheese and theyll subtract like 50 cents.  Plus they dont charge you extra for soy milk.  Being a nondairy person I appreciate things like this. Users/JeffShaw

20071219 20:01:24 nbsp Their lox bagel sandwich is great. Havent had lox like that since I was back east. Try it! Users/thelonepiper555

20080120 22:57:44 nbsp LOVE THIS PLACE!  I would recommend the herb turkey sandwich, or the garden vegi.  Great service, and fresh food.   Users/Dr.Lindsay

20080418 12:18:05 nbsp The BLTCC is one of my new favorite sandwiches in town.  I like to get it on a Blueberry bagel.  Yum! Users/YupYup

20080522 05:29:53 nbsp marinara and tomato basil bagels are worth trying! Keeps me coming back for mroe Users/mikokuriko

20080701 11:50:45 nbsp Any day I dont have time to make brekfast I stop in here for one of their delicious wholewheat, assiago, pesto or sundried tomato bagels. They have great prices on soda at $1.75 for a huge coke. They are always friendly.  Users/JamesLDownie

20080819 17:19:29 nbsp I like this place.  They have good food and quick service.  They also have a nice large accessible bathroom! Users/HazelWatson

20080901 13:39:50 nbsp Although they arent very spicy, I recommend the jalapeno bagel for the bacon eggwhich.  Users/TheDavisMarine

20081125 19:48:36 nbsp The bagels here are some of the best Ive ever had.  Users/Theo

20081205 19:08:10 nbsp Mmmmmm. Pesto Bagel w/ cream cheese. I usually ask to go easy on the cream cheese or else it makes me sick. They really slather it on. Way better than the breakfast choices at Starbucks. Users/EricaMacGregor

20090216 18:01:15 nbsp Marinara bagel with jalapeno cream cheese, red onions, tomatoes, and jalapenos.  Gives you a good kick in the pants in the morning and it is delicious! Users/GeorgeLewis

20090519 05:50:03 nbsp Oh my gosh, Posh Bagel rocks! I am totally in love with it! Users/Davisilva

20090524 01:25:31 nbsp I used to go here all the time until one day, I saw a couple of small cockroaches jumping around on the inside of the glass from bagel to bagel.  IT WAS DISGUSTING!!!  I just cant bring myself to go there anymore.  I had to leave that day.  SO GROSS.  Their bagels can be delicious, but if theyre going to have cockroach poo or eggs, JUST SAY NO!!! Users/MBarcelona

20090531 12:53:44 nbsp Came in here on a whim the other day, wasnt expecting the place to be so popular.  Definitely one of the best bagel places Ive been to, I can see myself returning any day now Users/JimL

20090711 10:28:19 nbsp Bagel was good, latte horrific. Not surprised to read comments below regarding cleanliness/infestation. Flys were sitting on the cashiers head like he was in some thirdworld country. Users/busthead

20090718 13:36:11 nbsp The asiago bagel here is great. But, the price and service are not my favorite. I usually just get a bagel and cream cheese, and they only ever put enough to cover one side. When I asked for more, they told me it would be an additional charge. And there are flies in the bagel cases. Kinda overpriced in general. Take your money to Konditorei. Much better breakfast, but no bagels. Users/DaniD

20090718 14:42:32 nbsp They have Shave Ice in lots of different flavors!  Users/RenewDenim

20090807 12:04:43 nbsp I recommend the Turkey Cranberry on a specialty bagel.  The veggie is great as well, the sprouts sell it.  The staff are really nice and are very quick. Users/shraken

20090914 10:45:04 nbsp I went there today with my 3 year old, who got a strawberry milk. Sadly, after he finished the milk, I noticed the date was 2 weeks expired. I checked and all of the Nestle milk was 2 weeks expired. This store obviously does not care about consumer health, and the staff did not appear to be sorry nor concerned.  Users/judyoneill
 Did it taste or smell bad? Is your kid sick? If not, then there doesnt seem to be any problem. Users/NickSchmalenberger
  Selling (and stocking) two week old MILK is bad, especially for a 3 year old kid. Expressing legitimate concern doesnt make that person a tool. Users/H4rry
    In critique of the store, it is pretty bad of them not to keep up on checking and replacing each item in their store, but it is understandable how something could have been missed, especially if they only replace things every 23 weeks (ie. the amount of time for said milk to have gone bad from the time they stocked it).  In critique of milk, I think people are too critical of when milk goes bad in relation to the expiration date that is labeled.  It really is about storage.  Ive had cartons of milk that went bad weeks before the labeled date and Ive had milk that still smelled completely fresh beyond the date.  Obviously, I would have looked at the expiration date before serving anything to a child, but that may just be me.  It is still bad on Posh to let that happen.  And as far as Nicks comment, it is logical that milk beyond the date could still be consumable and good, but how could the store know that? Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20091110 08:57:51 nbsp The food is great, however, when I ask for extra cream cheese, I do not actually get what I ordered. This has happened on more than one occasion.  Users/Crystallite

20091119 13:32:17 nbsp I love this bagel shop.  I get a pesto bagel with spinach dill cream cheese and they toast it to perfection so that it is crispy, soft, and warm at the same time.  I also just went here to order a dozen bagels for my work and it (to me) it seemed reasonable.  $14.00 for 12 gourmet bagels (bakers dozen) and 2 cream cheeses for $2.99 seemed like a great deal.  The staff is also very friendly and efficient. Users/BamCam

20100319 16:14:01 nbsp Tried this place out twice.. Had a sandwich on a bagel the first time, it was quite delicious.

The second time however, terrible service! I got a bagel toasted and asked if they had sundried tomato cream cheese.  Instead of saying yes, the lady behind the counter started talking to another customer, apparently a regular, who came in AFTER me. All she did was hold up some cream cheese on a spreading utensil.. So, yeah, they have tomato basil as it turns out.  I had read on their wesbite it was sundried tomato. No big deal, but at least answer me dont just hold it up and talk to other customers when Im the one youre serving.

Ill go back, because the bagels are toasted perfectly and delicious. I just think the service here is awful. Users/redbike

20100503 00:10:43 nbsp The bf & I tried this place out because Zeidas was closed, and much to my suprise... it was wonderful. I had the Turkey/Cranberry with everything on it, It was delicious!! The bf had the Turkey/Herb and he thought it was good minus the sauce, apparently tasted like pizza sauce. Anyways, $13 for two good sized sandwiches is not bad!! I will be returning Users/TICKtacTOEtag

20100516 00:09:45 nbsp Has anyone had a problem with having a lot of gas after eating here? Do you know what causes it? A friend and I ate here and had completely different items but the same rolls for sandwiches and we both got a lot of gas. Then we ate here again today as we like the place but again got horrific gas so now I am wondering how could the rolls cause this? What are they made out of?? Users/micheleblaine

20100517 10:51:52 nbsp I love this place, but today I saw an employee handle cash and coins, then make someones bagel with the same latex gloves on. Pretty gross.  Users/VinceBuffalo

20110330 21:24:32 nbsp Had their bagel sandwich there yesterday for the first time.  YUM!!!!!!  the tapioca....it was just okay, I think Old Tea House is way better.  the only thing I didnt really like about the place was the cashier guy; he didnt seem like he wanted to be at work.  but the girls that made my bagel sandwich were very nice and hardworking. Users/purplemonkey

20110524 13:29:14 nbsp I do like this place and their bagels are good, although they have recently become really expensive. I got just a plain (non gourmet) bagel with lox and cream cheese only and they charged me nearly $8, the price for the lox bagel sandwich. This just seems ridiculous. I get that lox is expensive, but this much for so little it stupid. Im not sure Im going to keep going there.  Users/MissMallory19

20110924 09:54:08 nbsp I hadnt been here in awhile, but was pleasantly surprised. Good service. Got an eggwhich on Sourdough, fresh pineapple slices, and a coffee for under $10. Everything was good. Ill be back more often.  Users/BrentKago


As VinceBuffalo pointed out this place has a HUGE cleanliness issue. The food might taste good but you don’t know what you are eating. My boyfriend and I came in here once on a Saturday morning for brunch and not only were there flies in the toaster over the lady was toasting our bagels in, she actually SNEEZED on them while she was making them and didn’t even wipe down the counter or toss the food to remake the order. She even had the audacity to try to ring us up for them like we would actually pay for bacteria infested bagels. We walked out in disgust. FILTHY. And if you watch the employees carefully they go back and forth between making food and touching money without washing their hands. You couldn’t pay me to eat here again.

20111213 14:14:57 nbsp I had a breakfast bagel omelet style sandwich here and it was very good.  My wife got a salt bagel and it tasted like a big pretzel.  The bagels are top notch, very soft chewy and fresh. Users/DagonJones

20120226 11:37:25 nbsp There are several reasons this place is one of my favorite downtown places to get breakfast.  Chiefly among them is the Eggwhich Omelet on the Spinach Asiago bagel.  This combination is nothing short of amazingness.  Yes, I love it so much that I think nothing of using made up words to describe it as an adult.

My only complaint about this place is that there is very limited wall sockets.  So, sometimes studying is difficult as I have to wait for a table (I suppose I could also just buy a new battery for my laptop but that is besides the point). Users/RA397

20120409 22:53:34 nbsp great selection for a quick and filling breakfast or lunch. love all the adds on the sandwich! nice prices :) and next to starbucks! Users/MelannieLavarias

20131020 14:00:44 nbsp Not sure where all the complaints are coming from. I did buy some expired Naked fruit juice by accident, but they pointed out the expiration date and recommend I go get different ones that werent expired. Food tastes great, and I didnt have any issues with cleanliness. Id recommend this place. Users/StevenVeach
