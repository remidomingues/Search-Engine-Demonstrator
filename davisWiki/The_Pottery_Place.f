The Pottery Place closed January 30, 2005.

The Pottery Place has bique (unglazed pottery) you can come in and paint, and within a week it is fired and ready for pickup.  You can use the plates and mugs and stuff in the microwave and the dishwasher.  You generally want to give yourself a couple of hours to paint, because if youve never painted (glazed) pottery before, it might take longer than you think it will.

Pricing

 Studio fee covers using the glazes and firing of your pieces ($10 for adults, $5 for kids 10 & under)
 To the studio fee you add the cost of the pieces you pick out to paint (they range from $2.50 to $40)

Specials


 2 for Tuesday: 2 adults can come in together and the studio fee will be $10 together instead of $10 each
 15% off Wednesday: all pottery you paint that day will be 15% off
