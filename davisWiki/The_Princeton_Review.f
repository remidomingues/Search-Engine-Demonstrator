The Princeton Review is a test preparation company that, incidentally, has no affiliation whatsoever with wiki:wikipedia:Princeton University. They offer preparation for just about any standardized test you can think of, from the wiki:wikipedia:PSAT to the wiki:wikipedia:USMLE. They started out with wiki:wikipedia:SAT tutoring and that still represents the bulk of their business. If you go check out the test preparation section of Borders or Yolo County Library  Davis Branch the public library, you cant miss their books. Additionally, they offer college matching services, scholarship searches, career selection help, and college admissions advising.

Their services dont come cheap. A classroom SAT prep course will put you back about $1000 and a small group prep class $1500. Oneonone tutoring SAT tutoring ranges from $2300 to $6900, depending on your package. Preparation packages for graduate and professional school standardized tests are even more expensive.
