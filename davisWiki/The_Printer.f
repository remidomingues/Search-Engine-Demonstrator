20070120 20:22:51 nbsp I have no experience with these printers, despite some effort on my part. They were unable to listen to my request for the printing of some pages to be used in a limited run handbound art book They told me to use Kinkos, multiple times. Despite my best efforts to do business locally and support quality work, the contract was sent out of state to a nonunion shop. Good luck with them. BrianDilkes

20071207 16:45:55 nbsp In response to Brian Dilkes comments; although we cannot recall this potential customers request, and would need more details to respond to this complaint, we apologize for any lack of service requested. We have the ability to print small quantities on a variety of paper stocks, and provide personal service that is difficult to find at larger chain copy shops. Users/ThePrinter

20080112 22:34:31 nbsp This place is great. I had a terrible experience trying to print my portfolio (for architecture grad school) at both Kinkos and Office Max. At Kinkos the colors were completely off (and the surly guy basically told me sorry, theres nothing I can do about it and at Office Max there was all this crud on their machine that kept showing up on the prints. The Printer did the job for about the same price as Office Max (though more expensive than at Kinkos), and they offered extensive help, and beautiful printing. I had a couple minor problems with pixelation and the trueness of my blacks, and they jumped right into InDesign and Photoshop and helped me work out the problems. Plus, they are just really nice and downtoearth. I definitely would recommend them if you need highquality printing. Note that it did take a day or two, so dont leave it to the last minute.

  Ive dealt with them a lot over the years, and I will echo PatMs compliments: helpful, nice people, and beautiful output. Some jobs take time, but Ive also had them surprise me with their ability to respond to my emergencies (not last minute, but fast). I think their prices are reasonable, rather than cheap; I do some business with other printers, but theyre my first and most frequent choice. Users/DougWalter

20100816 17:38:44 nbsp I had a very positive experience with The Printer.  I needed some response cards printed in a hurry for wedding invitations, and called around town to get quotes and timing.  The Printer took on my job for a great price, a great turn around time, the people that I spoke with on the phone and in person were very helpful and friendly, and the quality was excellent.  These guys leave the big printer chain stores in the dust... thanks! Users/KatieR
