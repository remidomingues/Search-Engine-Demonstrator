Mission

The purpose of the Public Health Club at UC Davis is to further interest in public health, to teach students about public health, to promote community service, to help undergraduate students gain networking opportunities, and to inform them about careers in public health.



General Information 

During our regular meetings, we take a combination of approaches in giving students solid exposure to the multifaceted nature of public health.  We have guest lectures from experts, film screenings, and student discussion forums.  Outside of meetings, we do everything from outreach at fairs, all the way up to professional level clinic site visits.  In between these poles, we have fundraising events, and we are looking to more firmly establish social and community service opportunities. We encourage all UC Davis students and organizations to contact us if you have any comments, suggestions or interest in collaborating for healthrelated events, programs or projects.
