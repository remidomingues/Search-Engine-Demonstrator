20110825 16:29:37 nbsp We are no longer Jacksonfly Recycled Fashion; were now under a different ownership/partnership. Our knowledgeable buyer is consistently on the hunt for glorious vintage items, keeping our inventory trendy, in season, and fresh! But dont take our word for it  see for yourself! Come stop by the boutique or visit us online at etsy.com/shop/RadVintager. Were a rookie of a store, but Im sure youll find our vintage collection knocks it out of the park! Users/mareeo89

20111113 21:59:57 nbsp Drove by the other day and just happened to glance at the window. I think I saw a For Rent sign and the store name removed from the window. Was I imagining things or is this place defunct now? Users/EliseKane
 Went the way of the dodo, Ms. Kane.  SM

  Best of luck indeed to those who have failed. I love all of the screwballs involved. May they continue to fail in the name of the genderless Lord. SM
