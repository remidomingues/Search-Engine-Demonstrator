Rules For Sophias Trivia Nights Trivia Night

1. The Quizmaster’s word is FINAL.

2. See Rule #1.

3. Teams may be comprised of no more than six physically present individuals. No other people besides the team members can be at your table at any time. I dont want to hear any of that hes just going to sit here and not play or say anything crap. There is no minimum team size. If you think you have the chops to take on teams of six people by yourself, then giddyup. Hint: When building your team, recruit people who possess expertise in different subjects (i.e. sports guy, geography girl, popculture geek, science nerd). In baseball, you dont want a team with nothing but shortstops; the same can be said for trivia.

4. No outside help for questions and no inanimate team members. Please dont call or textmessage people on your cell phones, download web pages on your Blackberry, or sneak in volumes of the Encyclopedia Britannica in your shorts. I dont care if your laptop can talk and has more personality than the rest of your team combined. Leave it at home. If you are caught cheating or talking on your phone, your team will be disqualified.

5. Do NOT shout out answers! Screaming the answers is a bit selfdefeating. After all, the object of the game is to answer more questions than your opponents. Don’t worry: there’ll be plenty of opportunities to demonstrate how smart you are at the end of the game. If you’re getting your buttkicked, please don’t ruin it for everybody else by constantly declaring how much the questions suck. That’s really lame. Don’t play if you think trivia is for dorks or losers or whatever. Repeat offenders will be removed from the bar.

6. The Quizmaster’s answers are correct, even if they are wrong. Don’t waste your time debating the Quizmaster. If an answer approved by the Quizmaster is clearly wrong, or you feel like your answer should be considered, feel free to point this out calmly and respectfully. You’ll most likely receive an apology and/or dismissive nod. We’ll reevaluate the question, but it is ultimately up to the Quizmaster to accept another answer. Keep something in mind: when in doubt, see Rule #1.

7. There is a ONE DRINK minimum. To qualify for a prize, each team must hand in their drink card at the end of Round 2. Cards must have the same number of drink stamps as people on the team and the team name must be written on the card.

8. Happiness is mandatory.

9. See Rule #1.
