The Russell Ranch was established by the Russell family in the mid19th century.  They lived and worked on the ranch for nearly 150 years.  The family home, the RussellHam House still stands and is located near the intersection of Russell Blvd. and County Road 95.  The ranch and the house were sold to UC Davis in 1990 for $7.88 million by William Russell and Charlotte RussellHam.

Agricultural activities continue on 815 acres of the ranch  farming of alfalfa, corn, wheat, tomatoes and fruit, and goat herding.  UC Davis uses 765acres for largescale agricultural and environmental research programs, such as http://ltras.ucdavis.edu LTRAS.  It is also home to the Russell Ranch Wildlife Area.  Plans to move the UCD Equestrian Center to the ranch were announced in 2004, but these plans have been either canceled or postponed indefinitely.

The Russell Ranch has no connection to the Russell Ranch commercial equestrian facility of the same name.
