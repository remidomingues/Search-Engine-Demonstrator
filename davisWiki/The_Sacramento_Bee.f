The Sacramento Bee (often referred to as the Sac Bee, which the website address reflects) is one of several local media newspapers. Although local coverage is dedicated primarily to the city and county of Sacramento, the Bee does employ one reporter (mailto:hsangree@sacbee.com Hudson Sangree) who covers Yolo County news.

You can either read it on paper or on the net. Reading it online requires you register (Living Cheaply for free). You can circumvent registration with http://www.bugmenot.com BugMeNot. Some interesting history can be read in the http://guide.sacbee.com guide section of their website (no registration required).

They also publish Market Value Place Market Value Place (MVP), an Junk Mail alladvertising publication.

The Sacbee.com web site has a customizable front page with five tabs the user can assign to a major category like sports, business, etc. One of the choices is Yolo County, where you can view the latest news and features on West Sacramento, Davis, Woodland, Winters, etc.  People who dont like flashy interfaces may think it looks like ass and is less functional than a flat page with text and photos.

The Sac Bee now features http://www.sacbee.com/content/online/story/12746788p13598447c.html RSS feeds. The news one can be found http://www.sacbee.com/content/news/index.rss here.

They have an ongoing https://ssl.sacbee.com/circulation/subscribe.html?offersundaysavings Sunday only subscription promo for only $19.99 a year. The Sunday coupons help when youre living cheaply

The Jan 30th Sac bee Style section quotes the wiki on Tim Spencer Alley for part of its street whys segment written by Carlos Alcala

The nice thing about them, though, is that they have a http://www.sacbee.com/datacenter/ ton of data for your enjoyment. Have you ever wondered http://www.sacbee.com/statepay/ how much your professors were making?



Do they publish or simply print MVP?

20060509 11:30:41 nbsp The Sacbee.com web site recently went through a big redesign. Hopefully its much easier to navigate. Among the changes is a customizable front page with five tabs the user can assign to a major category like sports, business, etc. One of the choices is Yolo County, where you can view the latest news and features on West Sacramento, Davis, Woodland, Winters, etc. Users/PeteBasofin

20060530 22:51:30 nbsp The new SacBee.com is too Web 2.0 for its own good. Frankly, it looks like ass and is less accessable than a flat page with text and photos on it. Theres too much flashy bullshit, not enough content. I have DSL, but if was on dialup (as I bet many of the SacBee.com readers are), I would be hurting big time. One of the most annoying things are the new tabs, which, although static, reload every time you roll over them. The way it automatically plays through tabs is also highly annoying. Here, let me force feed you news. Hey thanks, CNN/E!/College Publisher/The Aggie/Daniel Stone/The Bee. Ive really been holding out hope for print media, but the Bee is slipping. Users/ArlenAbraham
