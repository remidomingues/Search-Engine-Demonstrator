  History 
The Saturday Morning Folk Show started in the fall of 1976 by School of Veterinary Medicine veterinary student Stephen White, who had previously hosted a folk show at KZSC at UC Santa Cruz UCSC.

The show has had the same approximate time slot (Saturday 9amnoon, 8amnoon, 9am1pm) for most of its run, except for its first year and one quarter in 1980 or 1981 when KDVS management switched it to Sunday. It was switched back after overwhelmingly negative audience response.

20050710 17:46:52 nbsp I, Bill Wagman, have been hosting / cohosting the show for only about 6 years now. I previously hosted Mr. Wagmans Neighborhood on Wednesday morning. I took over when my predecessor Peter Schiffman left after about 10 years. WHen Peter started he alternated with Hiram Jackson and occasionally I would sub. Robyne Fawx did the show many years ago and when Hiram left Peter asked Robyne to come back which she did. Some of the DJs who hosted the show prior to that were Jim Viet (akd Wink Folker) and others whose names I dont remember Users/WjWagman
