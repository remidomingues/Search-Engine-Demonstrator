The Shack is a building that was used for house shows.  It was formerly known as The Spore Shack due to the poor condition of the shack behind the house. The Shack is not as gross anymore, so it is referred to as simply The Shack.  Shows were always free and BYOB, but donations to the bands were strongly encouraged.

Former Residents:  Users/CatJones Cat Jones and Lauren Bartelt.
