20060122 10:30:33 nbsp As far as most of their staff being knowledgable and informative, you might as well be talking to the wall. However the indoor range is nice and they have a decent selection of guns to rent (though they dont clean them very often). They have a good selection of guns to buy for a store that doesnt have that survivalists weapons cache vibe. Users/AdamBurgett

20060122 10:58:52 nbsp mmmm....they have the latest AR15 rifle...I wish I knew about this place before Christmas. Users/ApolloStumpy

20080709 19:34:20 nbsp As far as the staff goes, it is very hit or miss. There are about eight guys who work there besides the owner, the younger four are very friendly and helpful, while the older workers are often unhelpful and rude. The best time to go if you want service is late on Friday, because typically at least two of the helpful guys work that shift. Users/Meric
