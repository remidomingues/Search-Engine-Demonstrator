The Souterrain is a fourpiece folk outfit from Davis, and all members are, or have been, students at UC Davis. From http://theSouterrain.com theSouterrain.com: We make some strange music, but we do our best to make it pretty. Folk cures, lullabies, and revenge fantasies all have their home in our soundscape.  The name comes from the French word for Underground.

History
Image(souterpic.jpg, 300, right, thumbnail, photo by Caroline Baudinet)The band formed in November 2010, completing its line up when Sachs transferred to Davis from Orange County. Norton and Shirley met in a production of Macbeth in 2009, and, after several chance encounters, decided to play a few tunes together.  The results of their first meeting were Mr. Bones and What Ails Youtwo songs which demonstrate the range and sensibility of The Souterrain: intimate lyricism, spare melodic accompaniment, goblins and insomnia.  They called it lowcore for its understated intensity, a term coined by Norton in 2010.

In the summer of 2011 the band went on a threeweek tour of Ireland, performing at the countrys largest music and arts festival, the Electric Picnic. They printed 200 prerelease copies of their selftitled album, some of which may be found in the States. The album was recorded at The Hanger (an old almondfactoryconvertedstudio) and engineered by Scott McChane. The album will be released in the States and online in 2012.

The Souterrains debut album will also be featured in the upcoming film, Friends of the Bride  a romantic comedy about love and lunacy.

The band has welcomed drummer Kelsey Brewer (2011) and bugler Olin Hannum (2012) into the fold. Brewer and Hannum add energy and drive to the Souterrains live show, check them out!
