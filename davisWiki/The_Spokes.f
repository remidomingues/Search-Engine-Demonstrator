The Spokes are the only allfemale student organizations group at UC Davis. Founded in 2004, the group currently consists of 13 talented and dedicated girls whose shared passion for music and performing shines when they take the stage. Their repertoire includes a wide range of music genres, from top 40 (Never Ever Getting Back Together by Taylor Swift) to alternative (Seven Nation Army by The White Stripes) to R&B (I’ll Be Waiting by Adele) to classics (Sweet Caroline by Neil Diamond). The Spokes’ love for singing can be heard in their latest album, Shades of Pink: Volume I, which is available on iTunes, Loudr, and Spotify. Just as a Bicycles bicycle wheel cannot spin without the strength of all its spokes, the allfemale, allfabulous a cappella group, The Spokes, depends on all its great girls!

The Spokes set out to Music Scene entertain the masses with their unique aura of hot pink and black. Though they’ve only been together since January 2004, they have already captivated many ears in the Davis community and beyond. With their combination of good tunes, great charisma, and excellent choreography, they make fans wherever they go. They have traveled to the Bay Area, to Los Angeles, to wiki:santacruz:Front_Page Santa Cruz, to Santa Barbara, and beyond. Their lifetime goals include learning new songs, making new friends, and performing all over the world.

The Spokes hold two annual concerts, the largest being HellaCappella: An A Cappella Festival in True NorCal Style.

 Founding Members 

The Spokes were created in January of 2004 when two former members of the coed a cappella group the Liquid Hotplates decided the time had come for an allwomen’s group at UC Davis. Cofounders Camaron and Users/JaclynFromer Jaclyn posted many fliers in order to find the most entertaining, cute, and funlovin’ bunch of girls in Davis. After several rounds of auditions there were eight Spokes, each one dedicated to creating a beautiful sound and having tons of fun. They practiced in the beautiful and brandnew music room of the Infill dorms, and relied equally on the acoustics of Andrea’s apartment.
