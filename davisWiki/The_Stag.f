The Stag is a 21 and over bar on Main Street in Woodland.  A very sweet male/female couple, Heather and Peter Bell, own it.  Its a pretty easygoing place.  The bartenders are hot for the guys and lesbian women, and the drinks are cheap. The jukebox is loaded with oldies that some old timers might find young. Anyone will walk away from a Thursday night at the Stag Party happy.

On Saturday night, The Stag hosts punk shows, usually with a $5 cover. Once inside, Pabst Blue Ribbon pints are $1. The shows are promoted by Casey, a friendly punk enthusiast.

Since spring 2008 every Wednesday night local woodland and Davis DJs have hosted The Stock Exchange, a free night of DJs spinning wax 9pm till closing (around 2am).  Music ranges from 80s soul, funk, RnB, hip hop from all periods of history, electro, and anything else rotating guest DJs choose to throw down.  Music is always dance friendly and this night is highly recommended to anyone looking to shake their tail and get drinks cheaper than most places in Davis.
