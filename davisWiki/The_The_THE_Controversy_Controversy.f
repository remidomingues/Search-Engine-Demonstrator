The The THE Controversy page merely points out that regional differences exist in the way people refer to interstates.  This is not a controversy.  A controversy, as the almighty wiki:WikiPedia:Controversy Wikipedia suggests, occurs when participants actively disagree or argue about two or more sides of an opinion.

I hereby dedicate this page to those who would create controversy when there is none.  After all, what else is there to do during a summer in Davis?

No, no, no; we clearly agree on this issue.  I refuse to concede that there is a controversy, neither in Contra Costa nor elsewhere.
