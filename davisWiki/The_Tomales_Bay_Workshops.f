The Tomales Bay Workshops are an extension of the UC Davis Creative Writing Program and offer five days of working with an established author, receiving constructive feedback and generating new material.

The workshops bring aspiring writers into close community with nationallyknown poets and writers, and respected editors and agents. Workshops limited to 12 participants to insure an intimate setting. In addition, participants have the opportunity to purchase oneonone tutorials with a publishing professional.

The workshops are held at the Marconi Conference Center in Marshall, California, on the eastern shore of pristine Tomales Bay, just north of San Francisco in Marin County. The Marconi Center sits on a wooded hillside that overlooks serene water and mountains beyond. The center offers comfortable rooms, excellent food and inviting hiking trails. Come to relax, learn and explore.

Workshops are offered in Fiction, Nonfiction, and Poetry.

Fellowships

Three Albert and Elaine Borchard Fellowships are awarded to workshop participants, one each for poetry, fiction and nonfiction. One UC Davis Undergraduate Fellowship is awarded to a UC Davis Undergraduate. Fellowships cover the cost of tuition, room and board ($1150 value).
