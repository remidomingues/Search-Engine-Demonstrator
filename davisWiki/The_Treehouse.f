Its not certain why the treehouse is called the treehouse.  Its actually a twostory house, with the second story just added as an afterthought on top of the garageaccessible only from the outside.  So one interpretation would be that the treehouse has this name because of the second storys resemblance to a treehouse with its big fortlike balcony.  But alternatively, it might refer to the whole house because theres lots of citrus, pomegranate and other trees surrounding the house which has a communal back yard.  Its very umm.. rustic.

Picture forthcoming.
