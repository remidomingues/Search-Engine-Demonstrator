The Tremont Church and Cemetery is a great Davis Bicycling bike ride destination, though its really in Solano County and formerly a part of Tremont Tremont Township. In terms of population, Tremont never developed into much of a bustling town, and this church was one of the few places that brought the otherwise loosely connected group of farming families together. Users/WayneSchiller I have been told by the caretakerwho lives in the doublewide trailer next to the church and is charged with the task of keeping high school kids from parties partying therethat some of the founders of Dixon are buried here. So, please, be respectful.

The Graveyards graveyard is very old, and there are five wooden headstones that are really spooky places creepy, especially at night time night.  Keep going on Tremont and youll eventually connect with Old Davis Road back to town.

A few opening scenes of wiki:wikipedia:Whats Love Got to Do with It? (film) Whats Love Got to Do with It, a biographical film about wiki:wikipedia:Tina Turner Tina Turner, were shot at the Tremont Church.

Directions

Take Mace Blvd south for two or more miles, and then turn right on Tremont Road.  Careful, its easy to miss Tremont.  The church is about a 1/2 mile down Tremont on the left.
