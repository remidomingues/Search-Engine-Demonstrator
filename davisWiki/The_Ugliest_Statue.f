Towering over 9 feet into the air, the statue ominously smirks down at customers as they walk towards the east entrance of Save Mart on Anderson Road.  If you examine the statues skirt, youll be reminded of all those little things you almost forgot to buylike an enormous lobster.  Many wikiusers question why a forties 40 is not among those food items represented on the skirt.  Davis Senior High School Highschoolers who visit the shopping center at lunchtime often joke about the statue, and claim it is rumored to come alive at night and prey on the blood of drunken college students trying to get into Save Mart.   Most people think this statue is pretty ugly.  The aesthetic virtues of this statue have been the subject of lively debate and even http://www.livejournal.com/users/emosnail/167298.html informal webpolls.

The statue is arguably another piece of town art.  It is not however listed in the Citys public art collection.  It may well be functional art; not a sculpture at all, but rather a decorated concrete cap covering a mess of pipes or an electrical transformer.  The access covers and general shape seem to imply this, as does the position at the former edge of the property line before the plaza was extended.

Because of this fact, it might not be the ugliest statue, but rather the prettiest concrete cover in Davis.  Or at least one of the most colorful by design.

20050401 05:34:43 nbsp Mein gott... I didnt realize that was permanent.  I had commented that it looks like a sexual device used in the posterior.  It must be a functional statuary  note the access covers.  Bet theres a Christmas tree of natural gas pipelines or something underneath that

A christmas tree is a type of pipeline that juts up from the ground and allows access to a variety of pressures and pipes.  A picture of one http://www.channel6.dk/native/Grabs%20full/AK1122V.jpg can be found here.  Im serious about the access covers and the location on the corner of an extended lot  it is likely a functional work to cover up part of the infrastructure that used to be in the corner and is now in the center of the area.  These concrete caps are required and are sometimes mistaken for art (although this one is dressed up), similar to how the spherical concrete crash guards (in front of the east end of the tennis courts on campus or in front of Frys in Sacramento) are mistaken for mere decoration.  Like many required functional pieces, it has been made to look decorative, likely by a low bid contractor with hideous taste.  Users/JabberWokky

20050421 03:10:46 nbsp I saw it the other day. It really is so ugly. I dont understand it. Dont the eyes look evil? Its like an evil devil statue with little arms. Like a fat devil child. SS

20050421 15:58:53 nbsp Hmm.. rounded bottom, no arms, and rotund legs. Wait a minute, its a Dalek in disguise! Run your your lives (or at least to a staircase). The statue is so weird. SaveMart doesnt even sell whole lobsters. And how often do people buy leeks? Users/CraigBrozinsky

20050421 16:06:35 nbsp I buy leeks pretty frequently... But not from SaveMart. Users/SummerSong

20051203 17:24:49 nbsp This sculpture... How do I say it... Sucks. Its very lacking in the good looking department. I really think it should be replaced. Users/JohnDudek

20051206 16:13:48 nbsp I love this statue! it is so awkwardly trying to fit in and have the other statues accept it. I mean, look at the size of its heart! it takes up the entire chest cavity! Users/ChrisKadi

20051207 11:56:15 nbsp I am glad I am not the only person to find this excuse for art hideous. The angular shapes hideously topping a messy cone base, in combination with nasty colors make for a hideous, hideous eyesore... Users/MatthewTom

20051207 22:43:42 nbsp I think its pretty. I like bread alot. I also like lobster with butter sauce. I dont like eggs very much but this statue is beautifully done. The unique granite composition, hand shaves precision, its a spiritual aroma, a metyphysical gift to man. Users/JoeSmith

Users/RonB

20080430 16:53:43 nbsp Im fairly certain that those cover things are for lighting, so as to prevent night from bringing sweet relief from the sight of this statue. However, Ive never seen the lights turned on, so I must assume that they burnt out and nobody is sadistic enough to replace them. Users/JoePomidor
