The Unofficial Davis Scrabble Club hosts Scrabble games every Wednesday, yearround, in Davis, California.  They play indoors November to March and outdoors April to October.  Every person is welcome, regardless of their ability, and the club is free.  They play with the Official Word List, but they do not use timers and they play up to four person games.  In addition to the regular Scrabble rules, they also have some Davis Rules.  They started out as a small group of friends who liked to play Scrabble and have become a much larger group of friends who like to play Scrabble!  So come play with great people, eat some good food, and maybe youll learn some new words!
