The Untitled Project began in the fall of 2007 when Jayne S. Wilson wrote the first installment of what would soon become an 11chapter collection she called The Untitled Series. A compilation of nonfiction vignettes about an inappropriate work crush, the series served as a raw documentation of all the overwhelming trials and emotional turmoil involved with infatuation. Though her pining never managed to materialize into a real relationship, Wilson found mental and emotional wellbeing through the therapy of the written word.

In February of 2008 one of Wilsons best friends, Teresa Pham took up the torch and began writing her own collection of Untitleds after her quasirelationship went awry. Late one evening after a troublesome Valentines Day celebration, the two friends decided to combine their vignettes into one massive compilation. The Untitled Project was officially born.

Teresa Pham and Jayne S. Wilson are two of the founding editors of Nameless Magazine, UC Davis official undergraduate literary journal.
