The Used Phone Store sold & traded used mobile phones of all services. They could have hooked you up with TMobile, Boost Mobile, Virgin Mobile, AT&T, Verizon, and PagePlus service  without a contract. Some claimed that they have the cheapest accessories in town. They had cellphone cases for popular models and chargers for almost all kinds of phone. You could also pay your cell phone bill here. This was a great place to get replacement or used phone for the major carriers or sell cellphones that you dont use.

There is a new owner since May 2012.

What used to be the Inconvenience Store has now become a new Used Phone store (2014). The phones are very expensive and there is a 15% restocking fee if you want to return it for any reason. You only get full credit if you trade your phone for another one in the store. Do yourself a favor and shop somewhere else.



20111010 19:53:06 nbsp Make sure you thoroughly check any phone you buy there.. I didnt and ended up with two broken phones in a row. Never returning to this business again, except to return the second device. Very disappointing. Users/karinp

20130108 21:13:34 nbsp Horrible service, owner is rude and tries to sell broken phones.  Dishonest.  Will never return to this store.   Users/agiszekacs

20130129 13:29:25 nbsp I was there just yesterday to get an iPhone activated with payasyou go and I really liked the service and the price. The owner (maybe?) was very nice and helpful, he made sure my phone was working before I left the store and explained all the details of the plan I was getting. I recommend this place! Users/Awiwi

20130527 10:01:04 nbsp Im not really sure where these comments come from. I was there maybe six months ago (before the end of 2012) to sell one of my phones. Not only was the amount he offered me more than fair, he seemed to go through all the steps of making sure it worked properly but I think he also did some kind of check to see if it had been reported stolen. Seemed like a good place, but I dont have any experience with purchasing anything there, only selling. Users/BigJay

20140726 13:22:33 nbsp There is a new owner now  in the same location (its right next to the UPS Store in any case). Asian guy, very helpful, but the phones are not cheap. Ebay was selling iPhone 5 refurbished and unlocked for about $300+ and he had them for $500+. Bought a new unlocked Samsung Galaxy Express with charger there, have yet to see if it works. MOST IMPROTANT: RESTOCKING FEE IS 15%. That means that if youre returning the phone to the store,  youre not getting fifteen percent of what you paid back. If you want to exchange for another phone in his store, you get full credit. I suggest you stick to buying online. Users/kaylinh
