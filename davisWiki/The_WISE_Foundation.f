   International students experience anywhere from one month to one semester to an entire year at an American University while living with a host family. Their goal is to better learn about the US culture by living it. We recommend this program for families who want to develop life long friendships and a global perspective by hosting!

   WISE™ University programs offer unique crosscultural experiences for international participants and their U.S. hosts. University Homestay programs offer international students a chance to experience life in the United States in a typical American family, while pursuing studies and practicing English at a leading university. Programs are located throughout California in a variety of communities.﻿
