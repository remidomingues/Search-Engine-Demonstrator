20120816 14:26:37 nbsp Beautiful clothing, high end of pricy, but most are well worth the cost.  The staff seems okay, but one staffer took 26 minutes to ring us up, AFTER she noticed that we were ready to pay.  In the middle of checking us out, she stopped to help a customer that had just walked in, this entailed going to the back of the store to retrive a dress on hold.  then giving her opion of the dress.  Poor decision making  poor customer service.  I think when Im dropping upwards of $100 I should get resonable service.  Also, nothing there for anyone in the slightly plus size area except black. Not sure I will ever go back to store as I really felt angry and ill on leaving the store. Users/lindaallison
