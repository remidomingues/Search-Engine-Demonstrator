The Wiki Writers Miracle  The following refers to the bizarre paradox wherein eighty percent of the student body cannot write a clear and grammatically correct paper for their class; however, ninety percent of the student body manages to write in pristine English when editing daviswiki.org pages.

This bizarre paradox is partially due to the Wikis editing capabilitiesif you inadvertently make an error, theres a good chance that someone else will fix your mistake! But dont fall prey to the wiki writers myth,  wherein people assume the wiki is magical, when in actuality there are people behind it and for ideas to succeed they need to be interesting or rewarding.


I suspect this might be due to the fact that the various and sundry authors of this Wiki do not make up a representative crosssection of the student body as a whole.   Users/BarnabasTruman
