The Work Shop is a coworking space in downtown Davis.  Its current features include two spaces: a quiet working space with open floor plan, desks and shared tables and a separate work space with two desks and a conference table where cell phone calls, meetings, and conversations are allowed. Both have wifi and access to a printer, scanner, microwave, fridge. Daily, weekly, monthly, night owl and weekender options. You can try it out for 1/2day for $5.

The Work Shop is a misnomer, since there are no tools (saw, drill press,...) which are found in other shops. Davis Office Space would be more descriptive.

One of the primary intentions of this project is to create a space for people who are more productive when they distinguish work time from the rest of their lives, rather than living a life in which work can potentially be happening at any and all times.... it is meant to help free up peoples lives outside of work for quality time with family, friends and community. By creating a space that motivates a focus on work  with the energy of other people getting their work done  the idea is to renew the pleasure of work, and get it done in the process.

For professionals in fields where they have to talk to clients throughout their work day, The Work Shop is exploring options and possibilities. At the moment, the office is set up for quiet working where short phone calls and conversations within the space are absolutely fine  its not a library. The space could also work well for quiet and fume/dustfree artforms and crafts. Longer phone calls and conversations  and small meetings too  can happen in the sitting area and on the balcony overlooking E Street, and there are several wonderful places to meet with clients, colleagues and friends within a 15 minute walk (Tea List, Cloud Forest Cafe, Mishkas and more).



20120314 01:11:59 nbsp I glanced up and saw this coworking space, however phone calls longer than a minute being verboten is kinda a buzzkill Users/StevenDaubert

20120314 13:12:41 nbsp There is a sitting area just outside the space (but indoors) set up specifically for phone calls and meetings with clients. There is also a balcony overlooking E Street with a couple of chairs for the same purpose. The Pence Gallery courtyard outside is another popular calltaking spot, and is just out the back door, but not so great in the rain of course! Users/VinciDaro

20120326 11:31:54 nbsp Just booked a desk here: it is a wonderful space, with views out onto the back of Pence gallery shaded by trees, yet right downtown  and its a relief to get out of the house and work in a focused space. It has also great potential for a whole series of projects in the future  meeting space for nonprofits in the evenings, art showings, happy hours etc etc I highly recommend it! Users/NickBuxton

20120423 11:28:40 nbsp Please note @StevenDaubert we are exploring options for an attached working space where longer calls are fine, depending on levels of interest. You and and others are welcome to fill in the survey at http://daviscoworking.blogspot.com/p/survey.html Users/NickBuxton

20120504 16:18:57 nbsp I agree with StevenDaubert, this is a buzzkill for phone calls...which is PRECISELY the reason I chose this place to work on my dissertation.  The UC Davis library is not a place for peace and quiet (kids answer their cell phones and I witnessed a buffet in the quiet reading room during finals once), Mishkas has great coffee but it is too loud, and other coffee houses are also too loud because of 1) people talking loudly (I recognize it is a cafe); 2) kids screaming; and 3) cell phone users.

So thank you, StevenDaubert; you actually marketed this place by writing  ...phone calls longer than a minute being verboten is kinda a buzzkill.

For those who want to be productive, need a peaceful environment, and welcome a cell phone buzzkill, this is your spot.

20120510 12:59:45 nbsp I dont mean to compete with these guys... but Im wondering, is there anyone else interested in a premium version of something like this?  If you look at NYC/SF, theres a growing supply of class A coworking spaces, some of which double as art galleries. I work independently and have a big budget available to me... and Id love a space like that.  If there are enough of us, we could talk about colaunching a space that fills our needs.  Im thinking granite, floor/ceiling windows, amenities everywhere you look.   Users/ChonT

20120510 21:44:07 nbsp Ive got a friend renting a space here who likes it a lot.  He may leave a review himself at some point, but for the time being, Ill just say that while I dont think its the right sort of setup for professionals in certain fields (mostly if youre handling confidential or privileged information/communications), it sounds like it works extremely well for others.

20120919 14:14:09 nbsp Ive worked from a home office for a number of years  but the home demands (or temptations!) far too often trumped the office needs and I needed to figure out how to be more productive. I chanced on The Work Shop in a search for a downtown Davis office space. It has worked out brilliantly for me.  It is a quiet work space but also a friendly environment a place where you receive a welcoming smile from office mates and can also get a lot of work done.   Ive been renting a desk at The Work Shop for about three months and my productivity is vastly improved. The price is very reasonable and rental arrangements flexible  so it is easy to experiment with rental of a desk or table space for just a short time and decide if it works for you. It is definitely working for me!!

The issue of phonecalls has also just been solved!! The adjacent office has been leased and outfitted for meeting space and/or phone calls.  I had a 2hour conference call in the new space last week and it worked out wonderfully.  Desk space is currently (September 2012) available for rent in the new room for those who wish or need to be on the phone on a regular basis.  Users/NancyAllen
