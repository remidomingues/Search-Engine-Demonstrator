http://www.yolocrow.com The Yolo Crow is a quarterly literary media magazine that publishes Yolo County writers, sharing the magic.

They provide perspectives on Yolo County with crosssections of literature, prismatic visions on the people and places that characterize the mileau.  Anyone who writes in Yolo County can submit to The Yolo Crow. They accept poetry, short fiction and creative nonfiction of all genres.

Outside of the university, there are very few opportunities for writers and readers to interact in this communityFootNote(The Avid Reader Book Club is one notable opportunity, as is the free poetry workshop series than runs each winterspring at Cache Creek Nature Preserve west of Woodland). The Yolo Crow strives to reach out to all people in this county across the boundaries of cities and demographics, categories and genres.

Copies of The Yolo Crow can be found at The Avid Reader and Newsbeat in Davis, and at Jerry Cloutiers Used Books in Woodland.
