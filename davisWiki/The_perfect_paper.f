Youve worked hard, or maybe you havent, but there it is  a little bundle of 12 point Times New Roman double spaced exactly to the page limit joy.  Its spell checked, grammar checked, and maybe even proofread.  Your name, Reg Card student ID, and Discussion Sections section number are written clearly on the front page.  Every copied portion is perfectly cited  but you know it will be suspected, upon first glance, of Student Judicial Affairs plagiarism because theres no way on earth they expected somebody to write such a great paper.  But what do they know anyway?  The characters in the play were entirely flawed and in completely new ways.  The data was insufficient for the expected and historical grounded findings.  The proof depended upon something equivalent to the Mathematics Axiom of Choice and nobodys going to trust the Mrak Hall establishment after reading this freaking beauty of a paper.  You smile as you walk toward class, seeing your Davis Wildlife classmates frantically waiting in line at the Olson Hall Print Station.  You drop your paper off and wink at the Teaching Assistants TA.  As you leave you hear a lone voice, far off in the hallway:

  HEY  does anybody have a Campus Staplers stapler?
