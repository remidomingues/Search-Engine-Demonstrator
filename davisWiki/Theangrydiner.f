20110611 19:10:18 nbsp Hello and welcome to the Wiki! I personally would not bring my pet rock to the place but the situation is sort of volatile right now and accounts with only one edit regarding a controversial topic usually only make things worse, so you should lurk less and contribute more! Users/hankim

20110621 18:47:00 nbsp Hi AngryDiner, are you trying to make more conflict? It has been pretty much agreed on all sides that the issue was resolved and everyone has moved on. If you used your real name and gave info about why you feel so strongly you would find that everyone on the wiki is pretty cool. Please remember the wiki is not a weapon and shouldnt be used to initiate conflict.  Users/jsbmeb

20110621 19:02:14 nbsp As jsbmeb said, it seems that youre only trying to stir up trouble, and that is not what the wiki is for.  Otherwise, your comment had no point and was not really about the business at all.  If youve been paying attention as closely as you say, youd see that I have often disagreed with the side you seem to imply Im taking.  My main goal is and has been to try to keep the wiki from getting enmeshed in a debate that it doesnt belong in.  How about you try to edit some other pages and establish some identity? Users/CovertProfessor

20110621 20:06:36 nbsp If you really are curious, why not just call them yourself? Users/hankim

20110621 20:31:15 nbsp Just to show you theres a very strong consensus, Im going to agree with all the comments on this page. Users/Davidlm

20110621 20:58:25 nbsp Agreed...why dont you drive by and take a pic and put it up??? Users/PeterBoulay

20110625 19:48:43 nbsp Hunh?  I didnt change the hours.  Or at least I didnt intend to... Users/JabberWokky

20110625 20:41:53 nbsp Am I right in guessing youre associated with Pawsitive?  Its hard to imagine why else youd have such hostility toward Craft. Users/TomGarberson

20110703 12:22:16 nbsp Happy 4th of July to all friendly wiksters, dont over smoke your ribs, dont over cook them, dont drink too much, have fun. And you guys thought I was gonna say something else, huh? Diner Users/Theangrydiner

20110710 17:13:03 nbsp By all accounts, Phil has  in the real world, not Phils version of the world  very little to do with the actual business.  If I act like an idiot about Woodstocks Pizza, should the Woodstocks Pizza entry be slammed as a result?  Should I slam Pawsitive Groomers because you made aggressive edits against Craft of Fo Paws?  If Phil ran the business, I might agree with you... but the only connection to the business that Phil has in in Phils own mind (note that the people now editing are not adding his name... hes not a groomer, owner or manager, although they are now all listed).  Ill bet you that there are probably other businesses in town with random family members who are jerks.  That doesnt really reflect on the business unless they are involved in the business.  And it looks more and more like Phil isnt involved in Craft of Fo Paws. Users/JabberWokky

20110710 17:18:15 nbsp http://daviswiki.org/Users/PeterBoulay?actiondiff&version2233&version1232 And now it has been stated explicitly. Users/JabberWokky

20110717 12:26:47 nbsp wienerschnitzl  50yrs.   .61 cents on all hotdogs today only! Users/Theangrydiner

20110721 16:51:35 nbsp Thanks for your question about the curbside recycling bins. Both Davis and UC Davis have dual stream recycling—paper is collected separately from glass, plastic and cans. Since the paper is kept separate from the containers, the paper is of a higher quality (less contamination) and can be marketed a lot easier and for a higher value. When paper is mixed with other recyclables (in a singlestream system), it becomes dirty, and often is recycled into “lower grade” recycled products.  Davis has a high recycling rate—currently 60% of our waste is recycled.  Some folks will always try to throw recyclables in the trash, but a lot of folks in Davis are doing the right thing and recycling. Users/jgilbert

20110725 13:40:04 nbsp Yes. Users/CovertProfessor

20110730 12:37:29 nbsp At this point, who knows.  Ive talked to a few people directly connected to things, and its pretty clear to me now that anything Phil said should be discounted.  That said, its kind of hard to sort out what actually exists.  Things will probably eventually be settled: theres a court date on Monday, and I have a feeling that somebody will eventually swing through Woodland and take a photo or two of the business to actually settle things there (somebody already did awhile back, but they hadnt opened yet).  There are a few entries on the wiki that have been split out into current and former versions of things that share names; its possible that even if they do share the same name, it may make sense to do something similar in this case, given the discontinuity and change of nearly all groomers.  But that discussion should probably wait until things are a bit more final. Users/JabberWokky

20111008 23:24:55 nbsp I put that there after telling Ivan about the wiki and asking him what he has to say to people who dislike his business, then I asked if I could quote him prominently and he said yes.I figured it was appropriate since Ive been visiting the hotdogger since I was but a whee lass and it is quintessential Ivan... You know, very Frank   Users/StevenDaubert

20111012 10:22:40 nbsp Nope, but if you want to create one from scratch (be warned: its a big big task, and youll probably need to write a couple hundred useful entries before it catches on), you can either go to wiki:wikispot:Create a Wiki on Wikispot, or consider starting a pilot http://localwiki.org/ localwiki community.  The latter is on software in development, and so you may run into things that arent working quite right, and it wont be public for awhile (and you cant do a wiki link from DavisWiki as a result).   Users/JabberWokky

20111108 17:24:44 nbsp Hello diner! I know the lovely ladies at PGs as well (in fact i work with the owners sister), and while I agree with you 100% on his craziness, you are not likely to find any support for banning his business pages... On the other hand, go to town with the comments!!Users/Davidlm

20111112 17:24:50 nbsp Oops sorry i deleted a whole page, only wanted to edit the banned editor  Users/Theangrydiner

20111204 11:09:12 nbsp Yeah, I just knew he did hauling at one point, so I wasnt sure when I first saw it.  After poking around, Ive seen the emails and phone numbers... and I think I could guess this Phils last name.  Its not the same guy.  Do you know if the business is still operating out of Woodland? Users/JabberWokky

20120108 20:00:06 nbsp Any wiki can only ban on their own wiki.   Some ban everybody,  requiring signups.   The list at Davis Wiki only covers this wiki,  and is pretty fully documented in the talk page.   Only a handful of people have ever been banned here.   Many spam accounts,  however,  have (almost always out of Asia).  Users/JabberWokky

20120108 20:01:46 nbsp Each Wiki Spot wiki is free to run themselves as they wish.   Perhaps you didnt know that?  Users/JabberWokky

20120209 20:24:19 nbsp Thanks for the new voice.  Im really hoping this is a hitting bottom point.  The question is where it goes from here. Users/JabberWokky

20120409 18:52:14 nbsp A place to try in Sacramento is Buds Buffet, its about 50 yards south of J St, on 10th St. All different meat sandwiches for about $7, about 4 inches thick and super fresh and homemade. Wish Davis could do this, but probably not. A nice lunch like this if able to be done in Davis would probably be about $60, isnt that so sad.  Users/Theangrydiner
