20090424 08:51:54 nbsp Hey Theo, long story short, Im not exactly sure. The turtles were staying with my girlfriends family then, and her mother was referred there by the Peninsula Humane Society and SPCA.  She then contacted the rescue family, and checked them out in person before she gave them our turtles.  I think your best bet is to call a few different humane societies/SPCA (not county) shelters.  You should hopefully be able to find at least a few places in the Bay Area that are currently able to take two more turtles.  You can also try to find a group off of baars.org or other similar, but more nationally oriented groups.  Users/EdWins
