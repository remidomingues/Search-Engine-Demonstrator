Theodore TG G. Schmeiser (26 August 187212 February 1950) was a Davis pioneerinventor who built the Colonial Revival home with Queen Anne style features at  334 I Street in 1911. Ornate brick work borders the front porch and the home is known by most students as the house with the swastika. This intriguing pattern in the chimney brickwork was put in by Schmeiser, the son of German immigrants, as a good luck charm. Theodore incorporated an innovative fire protection system into the house consisting of a large backyard cistern and a water tank in the attic with water hoses connected to all floors; at one time it even included a roofmounted rain cistern.
