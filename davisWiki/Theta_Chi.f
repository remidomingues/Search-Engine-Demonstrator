Theta Chi


Theta Chi Fraternity was founded on April 10, 1856, at Norwich University in Norwich, Vermont, by two military cadets, Frederick Norton Freeman and Arthur Chase. When Freeman and Chase founded Theta Chi they very clearly spelled out the purpose of the Fraternity in the original Constitution: To “bind by closer bonds the members to each other, “the advancement and carrying out of any measures at the institution in which it shall be established which shall be of importance to its members,” and “the mutual benefit and improvement of all its members.”

The modern Theta Chi Fraternity still holds to those ideals steadfastly. With over 150 active chapters and colonies across the United States and Canada and 170,000 members since its founding, the Theta Chi model continues in strength.

In Davis, The Zeta Xi Chapter of Theta Chi fraternity has grown to become one of the strongest brotherhoods on campus since its founding in 1967, in part due to the endowment of the iconic and unifying 501 Russell Blvd location, continuously inhabited by the fraternity since 1970. A feat in itself, as Theta Chi enjoys the longest continuous run in a single location among all UC Davis fraternities. Resting in a perfect location across from campus between two lovely neighbors; Pi Beta Phi and Sigma Alpha Epsilon Pi it has 14 rooms for undergraduate members.

 The Creed of Theta Chi 

I believe in Theta Chi, its traditions and its ideals. Born of sturdy manhood, nurtured by resolute men, ennobled by high and sacred purpose, it has taken its place among the educational institutions of America as a promoter of knowledge, an advancer of culture and a builder of character.

It inspires true friendship: teaches truth, temperance, and tolerance, extols virtue, exacts harmony, and extends a helping hand to all who seek it.

I believe in the primacy of Alma Mater: in the usefulness of my Fraternity, in its influence and its accomplishments and I shall do all in my power to perpetuate its ideals, thereby serving my God, my country and my fellowman.

  Frank H. Schrenk, 1915

Philanthropy
Theta Chi is a proud sponsor of Davis Dance Marathon. Dance Marathon is a nationwide movement involving college and high school students at more than 150 schools across the country, all raising money for the Children’s Miracle Network Hospital and UC Davis Childrens Hospital. These students spend a year learning invaluable leadership and life skills while raising funds and interacting with children’s hospital patients and families. The year culminates with a 1240 hour long event where the students stay on their feet through dancing, games and entertainment in celebration of the total amount raised that year. Theta Chi has shown its support through hosting fundraising events for Davis Dance Marathon, and through Theta Chis marketing efforts, Theta Chi has drawn a 48% profit margin all going to Davis Dance Marathon in 2012 alone.

In Theta Chi, we believe that we can do anything to extend the helping hand. We believe it so much that every quarter we choose philanthropy to support and proceed to organize events that raise awareness and assist in anyway we can. By working with organizations such as the UC Davis Pantry, the Books for Change Program, Childrens Miracle Network, Habitat for Humanity, and more, we hope to motivate an effort for others to lend a helping hand too.
