They wax eloquently: The Purpose of Theta Xi is provide a college home environment for its active members in which fellowship and alumni guidance lead to wholesome mental, moral, physical, and spiritual growth.


With that said, Theta Xi (ΘΞ) was the first social Fraternities fraternity at UC Davis. The local chapter, Beta Epsilon, has initiated exactly 1216 members as of Spring 2014. As of Spring 2014, Theta Xi has 44 active members, drawing from a large variety of majors, nationalities and religious beliefs.

The chapter owns all three houses on 1st Street between D Street and E Street. Since the fraternity owns its houses outright with no mortgage, it reduces membership dues while increasing the budget for activities, including philanthropy, social events, and brother bonding activities.

On top of having the most active social calendar, Theta Xi has been extremely active on campus. Theta Xi was the 2012 Greek Week Champions with Kappa Kappa Gamma and the 2006 Greek Weeks Champions with Delta Gamma. Members consistently find themselves in leadership positions at UC Davis such as in ASUCD and the California Aggie.

Theta Xi has a Community service heart: the chapter has an annual fund raising event for Habitat for Humanity. Additionally, the fraternity has thrown two philanthropy concerts starring Andre Nickatina.

2009 Concert Controversy

In the past, Theta Xi has held several successful concerts, providing venues for Mac Dre and other local rappers such as Andre Nickatina. In the Spring of 2009, they were associated with a failed event that left ticketholders looking for a refund amid a few weeks of uncertainty and confusion regarding who was responsible.

Theta Xi helped sponsor a fundraiser concert titled E40 Live at Theta Xi with part of the proceeds benefiting Habitat For Humanity and the Breast Cancer Foundation. E40 is a Bay Area rapper who has performed throughout Northern California, and the concert was scheduled for the weekend of April 24th (anybody know the exact date?). However, less than a week before the event was to take place on Saturday, April 25, Theta Xi announced the cancellation of the event through Facebook.com with no reason stated. At that point, the Facebook contact for the event, Jeffrey List said that the Fraternity would be handling all refunds. Jeffery List, however, was a concert promoter, not a member of the fraternity. Ticket broker EventBrite and PayPal became involved, and a large number of Davis locals wound up being very concerned, pointing fingers at various groups, including the fraternity.

As the controversy continued, an http://theaggie.org/article/2009/04/30/studentsunabletoobtainrefundsforcancelledconcert article appeared in the Aggie that added more fuel to the fire. The Davis Police Department announced that they had invalidated the noise permit because it was applied on the basis of having local DJs, rather than a live performance by E40, who has been banned in some NorCal venues for his occasionally violent following (20090430 Aggie). 6trees entertainment company had been a major force behind the event, and they claimed the social chair from Theta Xi texted him a notice that they were canceling the event just a few days before the concert. Dallas Imbimbo of 6trees said that Theta Xi had broken almost every single section of the contract they signed with us, and the article noted that the concert cost $20,000, $3,000 of which 6trees payedsic of out of their own pocket. (20090430 Aggie) In addition to the various official comments, the Aggie interviewed a student, Gloria Lu, who said she had received an email from the promoter saying that they werent issuing refunds  and that she had never been told by any official notice that the concert had been canceled. She called the events really sketchy. (20090430 Aggie)

Theta Xis side of events finally came to light in a http://theaggie.org/article/2009/05/05/editorialconcerttickets May 5th editorial in the Aggie, which explained several points in the favor of the fraternity. The noise permit was secured by 6trees, and it was their misrepresentation of the event that caused the noise permit to be invalidated and thus caused the concert to be canceled. The PayPal account was in the name of the event promoter (it is not made clear if it was Jeffery List or 6trees, or if Jeffery List was part of 6trees), and thus Theta Xi had no access to the funds to issue refunds. The editorial ended with a fairly negative review of all groups involved: Theta Xi for not being more forthcoming and their lack of public communication regarding the collapse of an event bearing their name, and also 6trees for claiming breech of contract and grounds for a lawsuit.




Theta Xi is a Frat, they have been in town for a while near what was the borders complex. They have throw some wicked house shows. Theta Xi has had Mac Dre and other local rappers such as Andre Nickatina performing at theta xi before, it just sounds like they dropped the ball hardcore on this go around, I for one look forward to hearing about how this situation resolves. E40 is from Vallejo and is rather local, hes just had some minor mainstream exposure, as far as being able to come perform its doable. Most entertainers (lolundergroundrappers) charge the frat ~ $5000 in goods and services to come perform. Some people do savage shows, others come shady lipsynch and bounce. Daubert
Back when I was a new Davis resident (circle 19981999), they had some parties that were a bit too wild. I remember one I went to where some of the members were on the roof and threw an empty keg onto some guys head... Shortly after I left, I had heard that a riot broke out, and various party goers decided to fight the frat members due to their unsafe practices. It was a huge riot from what I was told. I had also heard a year later about another party ending when one guy bit another guys arm...  Paul Amnuaypayoat

Why would it matter what happened in 1998. That was seven years ago. Thanks for the insight. But if your are going to offer something at least make it apply to the people that are members of the fraternity now. That is just saying something to say it. Besides the person who threw that keg was not a member of Theta Xi so I would appreciate if you would retract that cause you dont know the person who threw it. Oh the person that bit the persons ear off was a phi delt and he was at fault. It had nothing to do with anything a member of Theta Xi did. I really hate when people just say stuff they no nothing about. That is not very fair to the people it effects. But it seems to happen a lot on this site.—DustinDevan

    History is relevant on this website — but dont hold it against current members! —BrentLaabs

20060717 22:49:06   There were absolutely no connections to narcotics. There was no meth lab in the basement as some rumors claimed. Anyone who is skeptical and go the Davis Police Department themselves and view the actual police report. —BenGolomb

20070129 02:05:09   They have throw some wicked house shows. —StevenDaubert

20070517 01:31:28   A picture of a cop with an assault rifle crouching in front of Theta Xi surfaced on the internet last year, possibly a result of that alleged raid. It was on the Davis LJ, and if I could find it Id link to it, largely because the cop was crouched behind ridiculously little cover, as if he were a cartoon character. —ThomasGray

20090422 10:40:50   Theta Xi cancelled an E40 concert that was going to be on Sat. April 25 and is refusing to give refunds. They also removed the entire event from facebook so you cant get in contact with them. If anyone knows any more information on this please let me know! —Selby

20090425 11:54:39   Theta Xi COMMITS FRAUD — DO NOT PURCHASE TICKETS TO THETA XIHOSTED EVENTS!!

    On Saturday, April 11, I purchased two tickets through ticketselling website EventBrite for an event hosted by Theta Xi Fraternity at 515 1st Street, Davis, CA. Theta Xi billed the event as E40 Live at Theta Xi with part of the proceeds benefitting Habitat For Humanity and the Breast Cancer Foundation. However, less than a week before the event was to take place on Saturday, April 25, Theta Xi announced the cancellation of the event through Facebook.com with no reason stated. I immediately suspected fraud on the part of the Fraternity, luring paying customers into a scam promising big headliners and charitable proceeds.

The Facebook contact for the event, Jeffrey List (jlist12@gmail.com) said that the Fraternity would be handling all refunds. However, my attempts to email and call members of the Fraternity were futile, with phones being disconnected (5307586294) and emails unreturned. I contacted EventBrite, whose staff informed me that refunds had been initiated but the sole refund power rested with the Fraternity. EventBrite also informed me that they alerted PayPal to the incident and had the Fraternitys PayPal account frozen so they could not withdraw any more of the money collected from at least 500 hopeful concertgoers. EventBrite called the handling of peoples funds by the Fraternity irresponsible because they were attempting to steal the money and they never intended to issue any refunds.
I also contacted the National Headquarters for the Fraternity, which keeps track of all Fraternity events, even on the local level. Jim Vrendenburgh (jim@thetaxi.org or 8007836294, ext 104), the Executive Director for Theta Xi Fraternity & Foundation, responded to my email stating that he would try to investigate the situation on April 23. I have had no response since that date. I still have not received a refund either. Im not convinced that this event was ever going to take place and I want the fradulent practices of this organization exposed. No one at the Fraternity will accept responsibility for stealing thousands of dollars from hundreds of unsuspecting consumers.

        According to the entry text above, they have an an annual events for Habitat for Humanity, so the event isnt overly suspicious. Its more likely that might just be caught up with the massive amount of paperwork needed for such a last minute cancel. And they dropped the ball in taking charge to fix it (trying to give them the benefit of the doubt, as itd be really stupid to intentionally try to hold on to the money...). Id recommend contacting the Interfraternity Council at UCD, so that at least theres some local looking into it at the campus level. Good luck to you and everyone else!

20090427 16:44:57   you all keep blaming theta xi and saying theta xi got the money, but if you look at your receipts, its not theta xi that got the money. its jeffrey list. he was in charge of the event and the money, and he is not a member of theta xi. he is the one stealing your money and not giving refunds. he kept all the money and tried to say that theta xi was responsible even though they are not because they never got any money. so blame it on jeffrey list. —yourmom12

    Was this a Theta Xi event though? Who is Jeffrey List and what relation does he have to Theta Xi?

Jeffrey List is a concert promoter that requested Theta Xi as a venue to host the E40 concert. Theta Xi was just a venue and never actually saw any money from the concert except for the tickets sold on Theta Xi property. The tickets we personally sold were refunded immediately. The tickets purchased on the web were not handled by any Theta Xi members, they were all handled by Jeffrey List.

20090430 08:50:07   An article in todays Aggie provides some insight on what happened with the concert... good luck getting that money back: WWWhttp://theaggie.org/article/3749 —jsogul

20090610 16:51:15   Heres an updated explanation of what happened to the E40 concert. WWWhttp://theaggie.org/article/3801 —EdwardWalsh

    That was an editorial on May 5th about Theta Xi should have done more, not been so silent, etc. On the 15th, WWWan article with more information came out. This is a followup to the 430 article linked above, by the same author.
