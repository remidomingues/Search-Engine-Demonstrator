Thille Hall was named for Albert J. Thille and was the collective name for Tercero buildings A through F. This group made up the northwestern portion of the Tercero area, bordered by Dairy Road and Tercero Hill Circle, until it was demolished in April 2012.

The university has been planning the expansion of Tercero for quite some time. First there were the Tercero South Residence Halls and the dining commons renovation. Then Tercero South Phase II. The plan after this was to demolish Leach Hall and build additional dorms there. However, in January of 2011, a seismic evaluation found the Pierce Hall buildings seismically deficient. The concrete structures employ steel connections to connect floors to supporting walls, which was consistent with thencurrent building codes but do not comply with current seismic standards. Under University of California seismic policy, the buildings were determined to be poor to very poor. http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/regents/regmeet/jan11/gb2b.pdf (Source) Since Leach Hall was safe for the time being, student housing decided to demolish Pierce and Thille Halls instead and expand there. The buildings were demolished in early 2012. Construction on the new buildings is scheduled to begin in September 2012 and is expected to be completed by May 2014.

A note of interest: While physically Thille Hall was buildings AF, the Thille Resident Advisors RA Staff encompassed only buildings AE. F Building RAs were included in the Pierce RA Staff.

Gardner Action Dailey designed this complex, along with Pierce Hall. It was built in 1967.
