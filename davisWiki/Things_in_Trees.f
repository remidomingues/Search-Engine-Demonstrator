While ambling along the streets of Davis, one might find an unusual object taking residence in trees.

 Notable occurrences of things in trees 
  Bananas Hanging From Tree
  Vacuum tree
  Shoe Tree
  Fruit Trees, notable more for why some were planted, as the objects themselves are what you might expect.



 

When I saw this, it reminded me of the Davis bike in tree:
