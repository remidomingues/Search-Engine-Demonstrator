Third Space Art Collective, also known as 3SPAC (pronounced: threespak) is a sheltered nonprofit organizations nonprofit organization.  Interested parties can http://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/fiscal/profile?id9792 check us out on our sponsoring organizations website.

We are artists, musicians, educators, thinkers.  We collaborate, we teach, we learn, we share ideas and materials.  We play.  Were about inclusion, equality, community.  We believe in repurposing materials.

Our goal is threefold!
  One: to maintain a space to be used as a shared and dedicated art studio for collective members.  (Come visit us at 946 Olive Drive!)
  Two: to provide a space where our community members can learn and practice skills and share ideas.  (Stop by on Saturdays 26 for our open studio hours.)
  Three: to operate a venue where art and music are showcased.  (Check out our http://www.thirdspacedavis.com/collectiveevents/ upcoming events.)
