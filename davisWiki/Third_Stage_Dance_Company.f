The Third Stage Dance Companys debut in spring 1994. As Northern Californias only multigenerational contemporary concert company, with dancers ranging in age from 10  92, its work was a testament to the intrinsic belief that Dancing dance is not the sole property of a technically trained elite but a form of expression, communication, and creativity that belongs to all people.

The Third Stage was born out of Artistic Director Pamela Trokanski Pamela Trokanskis desire to explore the aging process and its effect on movement. Inviting different generations to work together resulted in the formation of a group of capable dancers with the ability to explore themes that might  require adults or children with a wider variation in age than is found in most companies.

The strong core of dancers who formed the original Third Stage, worked together for over a decade before inevitable life changes brought the company to a much smaller, less active, role.
