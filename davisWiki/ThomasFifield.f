He used to catch spiders in a cup and set them free, but now he just squashes them. Especially large ones.
He is a cat person, not a dog person.
He is not heartless. Honestly, he really does loves animals. Please pass the gravy.
He always gets rainbow sprinkles on his ice cream when he goes to an ice cream place.
He still dislikes UDavisLife.com a whole lot.
