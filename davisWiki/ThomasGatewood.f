Hey Thomas, welcome to the wiki!

I was wondering about the page you created, butterbean.  You should read the Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner intro to the wiki for business owners.  In particular, the page is a bit promotional in tone.  Could you edit it to be more about your business and less about promoting the tshirts?   Users/PhilipNeustrom
