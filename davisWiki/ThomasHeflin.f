Tom Heflin is that guy with crocodile teeth in his ears. He got them in Peru when he was volunteering in a health clinic and orphanage. They were put in by a native from the amazon. Yes they did hurt so stop asking him that. He plans to graduate with a degree in NPB and a degree in Spanish. His passion is medicine and some day he will save the world, one poverty stricken soul at a time. In the meantime he works to improve his fraternity, his community, and himself.
