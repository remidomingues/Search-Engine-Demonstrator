Undergraduate Students ExUCD student in the College of Biological Sciences, B.S. in Genetics with a minor in English. I like taking eclectic classes, University Chorus singing, skiing, playing Pok√©mon, writing fiction (both short and long form, serious and silly), dancing totally grooving out, Hiking and Backpacking getting lost in the woods, The Davis Beer Shoppe imbibing, and trying new things. I have appeared in and directed for The Dead Arts Society. Unfortunately, I dont have http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/TimeTurner time to do everything at the same time. After taking UC Davis Japanese Program Japanese classes, I spent a cumulative six months in Japan through the departments JCHIP program, and greatly enjoyed my time.

I was Headmaster of the Davis Alliance (Harry Potter Alliance) for three years, and on a mission to become http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beefcake Beefcake.


   With regard to trying new things: Consider checking out the Renaissance Dancers on Thursday nights if there isnt a timeconflict with Chorus.  Users/JudithTruman
    I actually have a tiny bit of experience with Renaissance dancing from my years as a performer in a Renaissance Themed dinner. Often during this time I am hanging out with the Davis Anime Club. Perhaps one day I will make a point to show up, though! It does sound fun. Thank you for the recommendation. Users/ThomasReeder
