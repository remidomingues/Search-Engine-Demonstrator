Thomas Slabaugh II was the faculty director of the California Aggie Marching BandUh and a lecturer in the UC Davis Music Department, teaching classes in conducting and percussion.

Slabaugh became the director of the Banduh in Fall of 2007. The band had been without a permanent faculty director for four years prior.

He was at the center of a controversy in Fall 2008 after he http://www.sfgate.com/cgibin/article.cgi?f/c/a/2008/10/06/MNM7135E1B.DTL&tsp1 filed a sexual harassment complaint with UC Davis relating to events members of the band did on the road and at home. He was on medical leave from Sept. 2008 through Jan. 2009. The situation was resolved and Slabaugh continued to serve as the director of the Banduh.

In August 2012, he resigned his UCD position and became band director of Davis Senior High School Davis High School.

20081006 13:11:41 nbsp I happen to know that research was done into the position, and the faculty/administrations goals are not necessarily the same as the student councils.  The real question (and if this was a woman making these complaints this discussion would probably be handled quite differently) is whether the incidents happened or not?  Lets not forget that the history of this organization is filled with this exact situation.

And Im sure he must realize that this could jeopardize his career. Users/Davidlm

20090302 11:50:01 nbsp I am taking MUS 113, Beginning Conducting, from Tom Slabaugh this quarter (Winter 2009) and he is a really good teacher.  He shows  concern about the students and rather than lecturing, asks students for their opinions and generates good discussions.   Users/musicamyl
