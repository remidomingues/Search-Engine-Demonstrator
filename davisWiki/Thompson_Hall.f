Thompson Hall is part of Segundo North, which in itself is part of the Segundo housing area. It is the middle building and has the Thompson Ballroom on its first floor, the largest multipurpose room in Student Housing as of now. Because of this, it is often used to hold events such as informational talks on Education Abroad Center education abroad when the program runners seem to feel that the turn out would not be high enough for them to warrant them coming to the individual halls, and viewing of the Super Bowl. It also had the only kitchenette in all of Segundo North on its first floor.
