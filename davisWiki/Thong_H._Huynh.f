Thong H. Huynh was a Davis High School Student who was murdered at Davis High School on May 4, 1983.  He was stabbed to death in the science quad in a racially motivated attack. The City established the Thong H. Huynh Awards in his Memorials memory.

One of the noon duty supervisors who works at Davis High School knew him personally. There is a memorial in the science quad at Davis High.


There is a memorial in the science quad, but DJUSD has shown it is unwilling to maintain the memorial. Super shady  Users/StevenDaubert
