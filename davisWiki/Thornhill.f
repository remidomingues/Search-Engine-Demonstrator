Describe Users/Thornhill here.

20090712 08:57:32 nbsp Hi, Welcome to the Wiki. Thanks for your nice remarks about Paul Johnson, DDS, Robert Phillips, DDS, Benton Runquist, DDS MS, and Vahid Farahyar, DDS. Did you meet them all at a conference? Also, have you seen the wiki:toronto Torontopedia? That would be a great place to add more dental information, maybe you could make a page there like Dagon H.C. Jones, DDS has with Dental Questions. You should choose to use this account or Users/thornhilldental, but not both because there could be confusion. Thanks, and feel free to ask questions about the wiki. Users/NickSchmalenberger
