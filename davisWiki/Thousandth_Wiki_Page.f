Im a johnnycomelately to the wiki, but I think its a terrific idea.  I hope it catches on with some of the older set so Im not the only grandmotherly type on here.  But I do love the idea and how it continues to grow and grow and grow, just like the town.  Users/BevSykes

20060518 03:28:35 nbsp Ive been drawn into the daviswiki recently. It could go to a higher plateau of the possibilities of the internet.  How about a counter for the current number of pages and maybe a counter of pages that were created, but some of them may have been removed? Users/BruceHansen
