20100701 14:24:08 nbsp This nursery is at a really nice location just outside of Davis, very quite and nestled in some native riparian trees, a great little getaway. They carry some pretty cool rare and unusual plants, as well as a good selection of trees and other interesting perennials and annuals. The unusual selection is what I like best, things that cant be found readily at many other nurseries. Great nursery over all! Users/Didjstud

20100816 15:34:22 nbsp I love 3 Palms Nursery and their great location. Its a great place to browse with the kids  they get their nature outing for the day while you shop. Its lovely, and I always like giving business to folks who are active in the Davis community like Phil Kitchen/s? Keep up the great work Phil! Now, if you can only have a nice garden dinner some evening to celebrate your beautiful place. If so, count me in! Users/CaryArnold
