Thrift Store Outlet is by far the largest thrift store in Woodland.  It is located in the same plaza as Chubbys; you wont have a problem finding it.  It is hard to miss the neon paint on the window.  TONS of great clothes, cheap prices, killer boomboxes and lots of random junk.  There are sales every day according to different colored tags put on the clothes.  Its a nice little surprise when you dont pay attention to them.  In addition, there is a 3050% discount every day of the week according to the schedule listed above.  If you were given an all expenses paid trip to just one Thrift Stores thrift store, you better choose this one.  In addition, the Outlet also has candy machines located near the entrance.  Candy may or may not be second hand.




Known by some as The Stank due to its unique smell.  Users/ScottBiggart (10/2005)

I wouldnt call this place the Stank...it smells OK. I would recommend going here on a Saturday (for 30% off) and now theyve started this thing where if you make a purchase on Saturday, you can bring in your receipt that Sunday and get 50% off. Also, theyve got many 50% off sales on Mondays...this coming Aug 28th is one.  I just really like this store, and although you certainly cant go here with high expectations, Ive found some cool stuff including (surprisingly) a vintage sequined dress. I personally like to have a chile relleno at Super Burrito (and tacos) around the corner on Court streetacross the street from the Baskin Robbins before embarking on a shopping trip here, as it can be exhausting. The cheapest and bitchinest resale store around, by far.

I thought that the 50% off day is Thursday! Perhaps someone can verify, but I think I went last week and it was Thursday!  Users/ArianeMetz

20100110 09:38:00 nbsp I love this thrift shop and visit it regularly. Yesterday I bought 10 articles of clothing for 13 bucks. Most of what I bought were designer labels. I also have found new clothing with the tags still attached. I love their selection of jeans since some look as if they have never been worn. It is by far the cheapest thrift stores around. Their prices beat out yard sales on days that they offer 50% off. I would recommend this shop to any serious bargain hunters. AWESOME!!! Users/LauraSelover

20100702 22:21:31 nbsp Graduate Group in Ecology staple for costumes.  Its my favorite thrift store in the area. Users/elsie22

20100711 06:59:30 nbsp I used to live in Woodland for years and this one was closest to my place on Lincoln. I love this thrift store because I can find the most awesome stuff (wait, why does everyone care about what brand it is, is this a Davis thing?), I found some goth platform shoes that I couldnt resist, they were $2. Outrageous deals.  Users/Mogitha

20100914 17:40:58 nbsp Awesome thrift store!  It has a bigger selection than any of the ones in Davis, and the drive here is much less of a hassle than getting to a Sacramento thrift store. Users/DanaSullivan

20110116 13:13:17 nbsp while the place does have quite a large selection, good luck finding anything worth buying. every time i go there i always leave empty handed. they do have great prices though. Users/ChillMurray

20110903 16:27:28 nbsp Best thrift store ive ever been to for clothes. Im not sure why everything is a % off all the time, but im not complaining! I get kids clothes here at 50% off all the time, most items $0.50  $1.50, in great condition and name brands. I seriously cant handle some of the deals ive gotten. I hesitate to even post that here,... if it becomes too popular then other people will snatch up all the deals LOL. No but really, great thrift store.  Users/JeannineHenderson
