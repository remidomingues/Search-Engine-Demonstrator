 Woodland 

Woodland has many thrift and consignment stores, including:

  Goodwill
  Salvation Army Woodland
  Sweet Potato Pie  A consignment clothing store/boutique for children ages 014
  Thrift Store Outlet  A really good thrift store.  Tons of stuff can be found here for exceptionally low prices.  Because of the fact theres so many fashionhip kids in Davis, a lot of the good stuff gets taken from the (very few) thrift stores in Davis.  On the whole, the same isnt true of Woodland.  This store is in olddowntown Woodland on 106 West Main St.
  Yolo Hospice Thrift Store  theres a 40% discount on their already low prices for UCD students with student ID.  Another really good thrift store.
 West Sacramento 

West Sacramento has at least one thrift store.
