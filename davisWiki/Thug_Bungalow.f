Hidden deep within the recesses of Fountain Circle, it has been a sanctuary for the lonely confederation of asshats know as thugs. These include, but are not limited to Users/TimJarratt, Users/PatrickVisperas, Users/ZacMorris, and Christian EightBall Alvarez.

Famous Guests:  Local celebrity Users/TravisGrathwell occupied teh Zachs room in summer 05. Users/PhilipNeustrom once spent the night in the Zaction Nook. Lamar Heystek has been known to frequent sausage fests held at tha Bungalow. Azfer Skeet Skeet Skeetball Hussein has been oftseen lurking the premises.
