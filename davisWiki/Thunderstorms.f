Thunderstorms (with or without lightning) are very rare in Davis.  When they do occur it is either in the winter or spring or as a freak storm in the summer.  Thunderstorms here are very mild compared to most parts of the country.  A weather big storm in Davis is a few claps of thunder that everyone talks about the next day.  Sometimes they cause power outages. In extreme cases funnel clouds or tornadoes can form.

To put this into perspective for the Native Californians, thunderstorms can last for hours with several claps of thunder a minute, and sheeting rain.  Bolt lightning (straight to ground) can be the norm rather than the more common in Davis cloud to cloud lightning.  This severity of storm is rarely seen in California except perhaps in the mountains.


Thunder is a rare enough event in Davis that we can keep track of it:
 2014 
  There was a tornado warning in effect on February 28th.  Though there was ultimately nothing exciting in Davis, there were funnel clouds in Woodland and reports of a tornado out by Knights Landing.
  A dry, stormless winter was interrupted with a nice thunderstorm on Wednesday, March 5th.
 2013 

  Thunder was heard during the rare Summer rain on September 21 2013 (one day before the End of Summer).
  March 30, 2013  Thunderstorm with dozens of bolts coming in from the southwest.  Rain began around 11pm. Users/gcoville
  LOUD and LOOOOOONG thunder, enough that my buddy who was in the military in Kansas said it was the longest he had heard. Also able to set off car alarms
  March 31, 2013, 4:40 pm local.  More thunder and lightning.  First time Ive ever seen thunderstorms on two successive days in California.  users/jimstewart
  June June 910. 2013.  Midnight thunderstorm striking in the west between Davis and the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayacamas_Mountains Mayacamas Mountains.  Some rain.  Very beautiful.  My friends wouldnt let me out of the car to get a better look though.  Wimps.  Users/MaxwellKappes
  September 2, 2013  Thunder, lightning, and a weird yellow sky as the sun set (around 7:30 PM), after two cloudy days. Some raindrops to accompany them. Plus a rainbow.
  Correction, TWO rainbows. Users/MaxwellKappes

 2012 
  August 4, 2012  About 10 bolts were observed outside of Northwest Davis. Didnt see any rain though.  Users/mikeycrews
Yes, it rained, and more than a few drops too! We saw thunder & lightning here (J Street), for about an hour. Every approximate 35 minutes a beautiful lightning. It came from the NorthWest. Users/ConstantiaOomen
  July 22, 2012  Tons of lightning east of Davis: 2,000 strikes and 30 small (contained) fires. Amazing. My wife and I http://davis.patch.com/articles/photoslightningfillsthesacramentoareaskiesaddyourphotos#photo10738294 took some photos while parked in the country between Davis and Winters.

  April 24, 2012  thought Users/CovertProfessor I heard a slight rumble.
  March 18, 2012  just had about 5 minutes of hail in West Davis
    I was flying over Davis at 1100 at around 1:00 PM.  I saw the downpour and I thought it would be interesting to fly through it.  When I got within about a half mile the turbulence got so bad that I turned tail and ran away.  Users/JimStewart
 2011 
  June 6, 2011  low rumbles after days of rain.  Wacky weather this year.
  June 1, 2011  A few peals, accompanied by threequarterinch hail and a funnel cloud, per http://www.sacbee.com/2011/06/01/3670129/hailfunnelcloudindavisas.html this article in the Sacramento Bee
  May 15, 2011  At least one good peal in an unseasonably cold storm.
   With hail, and one instance of super bright then super loud thunder. Went and told roomate to stand down cause we werent getting shelled Daubert

 2010 
  Dec 19, 2010  Thought I saw a couple flashes to the southwest
  November 20, 2010  Rumblings with some flashing of lightning starting at around 4:30 PM, with rain on and off all day.  The lightning led to a substantial delay in the resumption of the Causeway Classic after halftime.
          Power is now out in the Cuarto Dorms and the U Mall. Anywhere else?
          Looks like power is out west of russell blvd from 113 east to about A st.
  July 9, 2010  Rain and thunder in the wee hours of the morning! Started at about 3:30 am and continued until 4:30AM.
  April 28, 2010  Moderate rain with some rumbling thunder and lightning flashes.  Its turning out to be a thunderous and rainy April!!
  Where is the lightning hitting?  I can definitely hear it.   Users/IDoNotExist
   Not sure how anyone would answer that question unless they were right next to something that was hit...
    Youve never seen a lighting bolt hit ground in the distance? If youre in a tall building clear of trees, its probably easy enough if youre facing in the right direction.
     Nope, though that is something I would like to see. 
   There are lots of real time maps of lightning, both air and ground strikes.  It is VERY easy to reliably track, as they are innately radio tagged.
  April 20, 2010  Rain, a touch of hail, and some mild (so far) thunder
  April 12, 2010  Rain with periodic but mild thunder
  June 10, 2013  Periodic sprinkles with many bolts from 121AM that could be seen from Davis and appeared to be range from Winters to the Coastal Range.
