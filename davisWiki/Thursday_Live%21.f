See Bill before he moves to Japan for a year.  Waiting for Bill we will be.

Do you wonder about the name Waiting for Bruce?  Well, Bill has a really good old friend named Bruce whom he asked to come up with a name for his band.  It was taking a while and Bill didnt want to wait any longer, so he came up with the name.  Bruce is the one who won a prize for his entry in the latest Sunflower Art Competition.
