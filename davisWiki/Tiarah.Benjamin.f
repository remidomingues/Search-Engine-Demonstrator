20100430 12:49:43 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy Tiarah, and Welcome to the Wiki!   Your edits to several wikis were a aggressively spamy, so I removed them.  You might want to look to see how these are community resources rather than business listings to get an idea of what might be more positive.  Please do not just spam the wikis... every editor is empowered to (and will) remove spam.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20100430 10:58:40 nbsp Tiarah, please stop adding a nearly empty page to Explore.  Thats for fully fleshed out pages that are valuable to the Davis community.  You havent even made a page for any particular business.  The wiki is not here for linking to forprofit web pages. Users/TomGarberson

20100430 11:00:58 nbsp Introduce yourself and establish identity before making any more edits. Users/JasonAller

20100430 11:39:07 nbsp Ok, youve introduced yourself as a spammer. Suffer in perpetual torment. Users/JasonAller

20100430 11:44:00 nbsp Anyone can use http://daviswiki.org/Users/Tiarah.Benjamin?actionuserinfo this link to help remove spam Users/JasonAller
  Sorry, I was late to the party.  Looks like you and JW got it all already. tg

20100430 13:56:54 nbsp Jason pointed out to me (and I confirmed): shes using the companys computers.  Update:  Holy heck!  Dozens of wikis were hit using that IP address.  We just caught these because they were under the account (one of at least two being used).  They spammed all of Wiki Spot.  Visions of C&Ds dance before my vision. Users/JabberWokky
