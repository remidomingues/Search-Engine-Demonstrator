Tibet Nepal sells Tibetan and Nepali items including, but not limited to, Tibetan Prayer Flags prayer flags, clothing, incense, jewelry, singing bowls, and Buddhism Buddhist and Hindu religious objects. There are signs posted throughout the store warning shoppers not to touch the merchandise and a gruff male individual (the owner?) will reprimand you if you ignore the signs.

Until mid2014 Tibet Nepal was located at 239 G Street, which in turn was once home to Bagleys Grocery Store, one of the towns early food stores.

20070327 11:54:37 nbsp The gruff male seemed very friendly to me when I inquired about various types of incense I was interested in.  He didnt mind me browsing his incense selection at either, though I didnt touch any of the expensive buddhist artwork. Users/DanReilly

20070410 13:30:03 nbsp I purchased a ring a week ago.  I was wearing it despite the fact that it was too big, and then it fell off!  I was crushed so I went back to see if they had a similar one, I found two gorgeous rings.  The only problem is that he does not carry more than a very large size, and he cannot resize them.  Decent retail prices for style and quality of jewelry and gems. Users/CarrieBishop

20070410 14:05:38 nbsp If you are looking for a particular item, especially a cultural or religious symbol, keep poking around after you find one, as there are often several variants of different price and quality located around the store. Users/JabberWokky

20070410 15:46:28 nbsp Not to harp on a local business that has carved a niche, but if you can arrange a travel destination/vacation to these places, youll releazie markup for things like this are around 4575% of course he takes the time to go there and export everything, but its hard to pay say a 100 bucks for something you can get for about 25 bucks in the country itself.

20070912 13:50:15 nbsp Love this store!! You have to pull me out like a kid in a candy shop....however most things are quite pricey.  Users/WeMo

20080519 08:59:14 nbsp Retail markup is pretty much ridiculous no matter where you go in Davis.  Take a walk over to the local new age angel shop Aquarius and you will find tiny tumbled gemstones for $36 a piece.  You are right, things are significantly cheaper in Asian countries, and I am not defending the practice of price gouging on unique items, however these are a higher quality of silver in many cases, and very nice gemstones, if you saw them advertised on ebay you might expect to pay a similar price.  It comes from living in America, we dont produce but we somehow expect to get things cheaply?  Oh heres another thing, if an American produced almost identical hand made jewelry, you would be expected to pay three times the amount.  Food for thought. Users/CarrieBishop
   Actually, the markup is pretty reasonable.  Travelocity says its about $4,000 to fly over and shop locally, as he suggests.  Not including food, lodging and time out of your job, thats about a 16,000% markup.  The retail markup pays for the export of the item (which has to travel around the planet), his rental of a storefront in Davis and the profit needed to keep his and any employees families able to live in Davis.

20090301 10:40:38 nbsp Awesome store.  The owner is very helpful.  The prices are not that bad for the uniqueness of the items. Users/Katarina

20110320 16:17:06 nbsp I love this store and dont think the prices are to marked up all things considered. Many beautiful items and wonderful jewelry too. I just recently shopped there and spent around $200 despite the fact that the person working there was not friendly (the owner I think). I felt like I was interrupting him the whole time I was there. There is definitely a sense of calm and quiet expected upon entering but its the feeling that you have invaded his space I dont like. When I asked him questions he was short in answering and often ignored me until I stood in front of him making him assist me. I was very disappointed with his interaction, since I was his only customer for the 30 minutes I shopped. I have been in this shop a few times because I love the items he carries but I would shop there a lot more if he were friendly and inviting. I always feel bad when I leave his shop instead of happy and looking forward to the next time I get to go back.

20111207 19:48:31 nbsp I have been a customer of Tibet Nepal for 15 years. Hera, the owner, is a sweethearted man, kind, helpful and considerate. Unfortunately, like a lot of small shop owners, he has to watch out for thieves, which may contribute to some reviewers misconceptions about him. His merchandise is QUALITY. He makes 23 trips to Nepal every year and brings back treasures that I havent seen in any other spiritual gift shop. For anyone who thinks they arent getting a bargain on his merchandise, just try booking a flight to Nepal yourself, obtaining lodging and meals, and see what  kind of overall deal you get. I will continue to be a very satisfied customer for years to come! Users/BrianDerby

20121110 10:53:52 nbsp I buy all my incense here. I particularly LOVE the Morning Star incense (fig and iris). I keep going back for more. The owner is pleasant in conversational exchanges, but not particularly welcoming and inviting as another user mentioned. However, this has not deterred me from going back. Users/tinala

20130112 14:23:56 nbsp I love this place.  I think the owner just comes off as being cold and unapproachable.  Hes actually very nice!  He helped me pick out the perfect singing bowl for me.  He sat down and helped me play them and even showed me some tricks Id never seen done with a bowl before.  Ive been here multiple times and will continue to come here and I would prefer to test out or feel the item I seek. Users/ChanS
