Tibetan Prayer Flags are a common sight throughout Davis. They represent a hallmark of Buddhism Tibetan Buddhism, an Eastern religion that holds broad appeal among townies the locals.  The small rectangular cloths are held together by strings, and in particular, are frequently seen strung down along the roofs of front porches. The flags are easily recognizable by their bright colors and Tibetan script. The writing consists of mantras or prayers for peace, compassion, or general wellbeing.

Some of the flags in town have a very wornout appearance; this is due to the Tibetan custom in which the flags are supposed to continue flying even as they begin to disintegrate. This reflects their status as sacred objects that should not be tampered with once hung, and it also represents the fleeting nature of life.

Tibetan prayer flags can be purchased at Himalaya Gifts and Tibet Nepal.
