Ticks are small Town Fauna insects that latch on to hosts such as People and other Town Fauna animals.  In particular, Dogs are known for easily picking up ticks as they run through tall grasses.  They can be battled using similar methods as to fighting Mosquitoes, such as wearing long Clothing and using insect repellant.  Though the Central Davis town proper shouldnt usually have ticks in it, many of the open Fields within, and especially outside of Davis, are home to ticks (e.g., along Putah Creek, Ditches, etc).

In California, all ticks should be assumed carriers of lyme disease.  The http://www.lymedisease.org/ California Lyme Disease Association has several http://www.lymedisease.org/california/california_brochure.html brochures available to educate the public.  Key: tick nymphs are most hazardous to your health due to their size and feeding patterns.  Take all proper precautions when venturing into tick territory.  For example, use tick repellant, tuck pant cuffs into your socks, wear lightcolored clothes, keep your arms covered, and wear a hat.  In heavily infested areas, applying wiki:wikipedia:permethrin is not a bad idea, but keep away from cats.
