>TiffanieDavis is staring into your soul.


TiffanieDavis, formerly Gabourie, is a Goddess.
She takes great pleasure in dancing, breathing, yogaing, fire walking, tree climbing & hot springing.
In the 9 years that she has been living in Davis, Tiffanie has been seen behind the counter
@ Samiras, De Colores & Aquarius.
On April Fools Day of 2006, TiffanieDavis became a Davis when she climbed a tree with & got hitched to
that sexy DFC delislave you may know as BenjaminDavis.

She is now living happily ever after.

You can most often glimpse her working hard/hardly working at The Davis Food Coop, strolling through Downtown Davis, or hanging out with one of three or all of these chumps below! (LR: Users/AmeliaCarlson, Users/JevanGray & BenjaminDavis).


Be it known: As much as TiffanieDavis loves the city of Davis, she aspires to get the hell out of the valley and find community in one of the following places:

Mt. Shasta, Sebastopol, AshlandOregon, BellinghamWashington, Arcata, SomewhereINhawaii or SomewhereINalaska.

TiffanieDavis would much appreciate any other happy community recommendations you would like to toss her way.
