A favorite amongst westside Arboretum frequenters, Monsieur Tig McJRoolems resides within a largeish bush beside the UCD Equestrian Center.  Described as dignified, enigmatic, and a relentless cuddlywhumper, Tig takes to young female strangers, enticing them with his soulful eyes, lustrous coat, and feline charm.  But unlike any other cat you might meet, Tig has a rather captivating secret...  If you take the time to acquaint yourself with himgiven his unpretentious presenceand treat him well, he might just bestow upon you, a startlingly affectionate gift...


Tig McJRoolems was recently adopted by a wonderful family to try and give him a warm loving home. Upon bringing him into the veterinarian for a standard health check it was discovered that he was positive for FIV (feline HIV). FIV is a feline only disease and is contagious to any unvaccinated cats. It is transferred just like the human strain of HIV/AIDS and is just as fatal. Unfortunately Tig had to be humanely euthanized due to the suffering the disease causes. He will be greatly missed.
