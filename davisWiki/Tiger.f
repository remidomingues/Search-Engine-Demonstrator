Tiger is owned by Users/SamSellers and lives a leisurely life of sleeping, pooping, staring at invisible things on the wall and running away from them, cleaning herself, eating, throwing up what she just ate, and then eating that too.
She is fifteen years old and her full name is Tiger II, named after Users/SamSellers Sams first cat Tiger I, who was run over in front of his eyes when he was five. She has taken well to Davis, and has already made many friends there.

 Tiger enjoys playing dressup 
Her owner figures that for all the money he spends on her food, and if you take into account how little she helps out around the house, she owes it to him to dress her up in embarrassing costumes once in a while.
