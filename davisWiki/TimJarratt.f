 Tim Jarratt 
Tim Jarratt is a mathematics major at the University of California at Davis. Often he finds himself being asked What are you going to do with a degree in mathematics?; between his best imitation of Lamar Heystek Lamar Heysteks shrug and the tentative answer of research, he hasnt yet come up with an answer. Often you can find him reading a book in the CoHo and although he may be looking for people he knows, chances are that hes really involved in his reading. In other news, he apparently still lives in the Thug Bungalow.

Semifamous for photoshopping one of the Hydrology Department doors into room number 1337 of the Thugology Dept

Tim is also huge in the underground Extreme Butter Fetish scene.  You can check it out at http://del.icio.us/tag/extreme+butter+fetish EXTREMEBUTTERFETISH.COM (not actually extremebutterfetish.com).
