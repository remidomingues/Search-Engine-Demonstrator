Hi, Im a UCD graduate  AMR: Sustainable Production Systems B.S. My natural range includes Davis, and I can be seen there from time to time. I love Wiki and the opensource concept that it represents. Its been a great help to me in publicizing the EC Garden, and in just exploring Davis and more.



Hey, Tim.  The redirects do redirect, but they display that notice rather than redirecting after you edit just to give you a chance to fix any mistakes you might have made.  If you (or anybody else) goes to Experimental College Garden, you will be automatically redirected. UPDATE: It was pointed out that you were trying to redirect to a redirect... that was the problem.  Just go ahead and redirect to the real entry and it works fine.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20091007 08:00:55 nbsp Not off the top of my head (that I can personally recommend at any rate), but I can ask around.  I actually got a query regarding that fairly recently, so its a current question. Users/BillKendrick might be able to suggest somebody. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20091007 12:16:22 nbsp Hey, I saw your note about web design recommendations and I wanted to refer you to Baytel Baytel Consulting, who I sometimes work for, although I do more system administration than design. Baytel designs and hosts websites, and they often use other hosts also. They designed and host the websites for The Fitness Garage and Lauren Vaage Construction. I hope you find something that works for you! Users/NickSchmalenberger

20100416 04:18:49 nbsp If Lauren couldnt get on the computer for some reason and asked you to post for him, you should just explain that instead of replacing your username with his. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20100612 02:53:40 nbsp That makes sense, but it looks weird because the username of who supposedly wrote it is not actually in the history because they werent really logged in. The way I have handled those situations (when I have edited with somebody elses account by mistake) I reverted it, then logged back in as myself and done the edit again.  Users/NickSchmalenberger
