Address(Tim Spencer Alley, 38.54442, 121.74)  is an Alleys alley that runs through part of Downtown, paralleling F Street and G Street between 2nd Street and 4th Street. This alley was named after the nicest UPS delivery person that ever lived.

The street doesnt have enough bicycle parking bike racks. There arent any between 2nd Street Second and 3rd Street Third Streets so the people who work in those buildings lock their bikes to posts. Thats not the purpose of the posts and there arent enough of them either.

The clarity would be greatly improved if the photo was oriented with North Up, like all other decent maps. Users/SteveDavison
 North is up in this picture, I merely rotated it 13 degrees CW.  Users/ArlenAbraham
   How could North be UP, when F/G streets arent NorthSouth aligned? I dont know if its 13 degrees, but theres something wrong here. Users/SteveDavison
    If it were tilted another 5 degrees, it would be oriented to magnetic north. I think that in this particular picture, up is northish. Users/JoePomidor
