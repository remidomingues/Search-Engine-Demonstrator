Tim Walter was born in 1981 in Vancouver, British Columbia.  Sadly, his Canadian roots will prevent him from ever being president.

Tim is well known throughout South Davis for his prowess in wiffle ball, playing many of his games in Santa Paula Park.  He went on to play professional baseball in the Netherlands for the Domstad Dodgers, located in Utrecht.

Tim first gained recognition among Davisites at the age of 10, when he could be seen at most Aggie basketball games above the North bleachers, with John Hoffart, dancing to the music of the California Aggie Marching BandUh to the delight of the crowd.  He has also participated in several events known to be part of True South Davis Tales, including the Conehead Dance Extravaganza and the Steves Pizza Portable Oven Debacle.

Tim attended Pioneer School, Holmes Junior High School and Davis High School.

He currently resides in San Diego, CA.
