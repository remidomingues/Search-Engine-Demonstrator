Time Capsules are fun.  Intro here.

What most students lovingly refer to as time capsules is whats hidden in their dorm room, behind the wall plates for the phones in almost all of the dorms.  These arent actual capsules to be opened at some date, but usually assorted memorabilia and objects people pass on to future students.  Movie stubs, on campus concert tickets, condoms, etc.  One of the most common items left are pictures and occasionally papers with trivia and events written out (some sort of documentation.  Its fun as a freshman in the dorms to pry off the phone jack plate and poke around in the wall and see whats hidden.  It also is a bit of a test  what did you leave behind for the following year?  It can be a fun end of the year competition.

There are also time capsules along the outside of Shields Library, numbered by graduating class.  These are the more conventional sort, meant to be opened at some future date.

Where else in town are there time capsules, and what year are they supposed to be opened in?

20070617 17:35:07 nbsp Are you referring to the concrete rectangles with the brass numbers in them? Users/JasonAller

    Yeah. Users/PhilipNeustrom

         If those are time capsules, when are they supposed to be opened, and wouldnt the first of them have already been opened? Users/JasonAller

             I dont know the answer to either.  Id just heard that they were capsules. Users/PhilipNeustrom

20070617 18:26:07 nbsp We had a Time Crapsule (yes, spelling intended) burying party at the 3rd house in from Poleline and Covell in about 2001 or so.  In the front yard near the tree, about 2 feet down, lies a metal tin container with various meaningless crap we all brought over to bury in the Time Crapsule.  This was Geoff Greenes house.  Geoff taught bike welding at the Experimental College, and worked at Kens Bike and Ski.  I still see some of his recumbent schwinn bike creations riding around town.  Oh, the time for unburying?  2030.  Or thereabouts.Users/JeffShaw
  If it hasnt rusted by then... :) Users/KarlMogel KJM

20070617 22:48:11 nbsp There are some sort of markers along Howard Way in front of each tree, but Im not sure if theyre capsules or not. They just have a year on each in brass, much like the markers next to Shields.  Users/EliseKane

20070617 22:52:37 nbsp Just noting, there should be a time capsule at some corner stones, wherever the Masons performed one of their ceremonies anyway. Users/DavidPoole
 Actually, placing a time capsule beneath a cornerstone would be unusual for the Masons. The cornerstones have stuff etched in them and thats about it. Users/WilliamLewis

20070618 09:50:14 nbsp Behind a breakaway panel in a cupboard, I once found a little metal cylinder that from the looks of it, was a grinder for shredding kitchen herbs... but that sure wasnt oregano in it!

There is the everpopular almostusedup cleaners you can leave under the sink when you move out of places... if that counts. Users/KarlMogel
