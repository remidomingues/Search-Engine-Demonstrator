http://balkandance.net/Kabile Kabile Traditional Wedding Band was formed in 1978 and became one of the most popular bands in the Thrace region of Bulgaria. Based in the city of Yambol, the group took its name from the village of Kabile, where they performed one of their earliest gigs. The group specialized in performing native music on traditional village instruments, resulting in an acoustic experience quite different from that played on Western instruments influenced by American jazz. This form of Bulgarian wedding music has attracted worldwide attention and scholarship for its incredible virtuosity and musicianship. During its heyday, the band played almost every weekend at weddings, baptisms and cultural festivals in Thrace.

The band plays all the instruments of a traditional Bulgarian village band. The gaida is a bagpipe made of goat skin and pipes. The tapan is a large wooden drum covered with sheep or goat skin and played with two specially designed drumming sticks: the kukuda is a pipeshaped stick of walnut and the prachka is a thin switch, usually made of dogwood or willow. The kaval is a flutelike instrument open at both ends, played by blowing on the smaller, sharpened end. The gadulka is a pearshaped string instrument, played vertically in front of the musician. These four instruments have a centuriesold history in Bulgarian folk music; as a modern addition, the band also includes the accordion (ca. 1832).

The bands members each serve as an outstanding representative of his or her musical specialty. Individually, each member of the band has an exceptional history of scholarship and performance. Collectively they form one of the most respected ensembles in Bulgarian Thrace.

Revered Cretebased composerperformers Ross Daly and Kelly Thoma of Labyrinth join exploratory string duo Teslim (Kaila Flexer and Gari Hegedus) in a variety of live concert programs and musical workshops throughout California, October 1428, 2012.


When Bay Area violinist and composer Kaila Flexer, one half of Teslim, first heard Ross Daly on the radio, she immediately changed courses to find his recordings at a local store. With her Teslim collaborator and fellow devotee of Eastern Mediterranean music, Gari Hegedus, she marveled at Daly’s musical intensity and fluidity, the freshness of his approach and the integrity and depth of his transformational, multicultural artistic vision.


Although of Irish descent, Ross Daly defies ethnic classification. From a very early age, Daly discovered that music was, in his own words, the language of my dialogue with that which I perceive to be sacred. This dialogue eventually led him to studies and collaborations with many great masters of the Middle East, Central Asia, and the Indian subcontinent. Widely traveled, Daly has been based on the island of Crete for decades. Universally recognized as one of the foremost experts on the islands rich musical traditions, he established the Labyrinth Musical Workshop in the village of Houdetsi, a unique educational institution and ethnic instrument museum staffed by international master musicians and dedicated to the study of the world’s modal music traditions.

After several years of studying and performing Ross’ compositions here in the U.S., Flexer and Hegedus dreamt up a project to collaborate with Daly and his musical partner, Kelly Thoma. Both Daly and Thoma are masters of the lyra, a pearshaped bowed instrument found on Crete, to which the enterprising musicians have added an additional fleet of sympathetic strings. Uniting as composers and collaborators, the quartet of players of multiethnic string instruments began to craft and explore music that springs and departs from the traditions of the Eastern Mediterranean.

Ross Daly, Kelly Thoma & Teslim will be joined by Miles Jay on Bass. They invite listeners to join them on a journey of unexpected musical pathways and crossroads. Inspired by the diverse facets of traditional music of Greece and the Near East, these performers offer routes to a core sonic experience that defies easy geographic categorization.
