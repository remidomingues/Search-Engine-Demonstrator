Classical and Contemporary Dance Classes
with Timothy Nutter

Timothys teaching style emphasizes aspects of dance relating to theater and music: emotion, gesture, tempo and musicality. He also believes in encouraging students to think and evaluate for themselves, to draw connections between dance and other areas of experience, and always to continue making adjustments.

Very Beginning Adult Ballet

Here is a beginning ballet class just for adults. If you have never tried ballet before, this is the class to get you started. We will cover all the fundamental skills, exercises and vocabulary of basic ballet technique, but at a slow pace, ideal for beginning adults. It’s a great way to exercise the whole body, while you enjoy learning about a creative and beautiful dance tradition.
