Tinywater Photography are photographers. They love to have fun, to laugh, to get excited about the work they create and see others do the same. They love what they do, they love making new friends, learning about people, and seeing the individual come through in their portraits. They love to create art, to offer something different to push the envelope and challenge ourselves. They love caring passionately for our clients. They are extremely lucky for that and for all the awesome people they have met and all the amazing clients we have!

The couples they photography photograph are fun, edgy and modern. They work hard to capture every single candid emotion and you are the star of the day. Their wedding photography style is fine art and journalistic with a blend of portraiture and fashion editorial. Many people have described their style as creative, unique, and avant garde. They strive to capture images that could grace the pages of a magazine.

You can view their work on their website galleries at www.tinywater.com. They frequently add recent shoots to their studio blog.
