20090813 17:33:52 nbsp We are sorry to have learned that Titanium Press has closed its doors indefinitely. Titanium provided a needed service to the Davis community, and we welcomed them as healthy competition. The owner has told us that he is directing business to us (thanks!). We offer most, if not all, the services previously available at Titanium, including digital printing. Please contact us at The Printer for any offset or digital printing you need. 5307532519   www.theprinter.net  Users/ThePrinter
