 To Do (everybody!) 
  Wiki stuff thats important to you  socially, culturally, deliciously, etc. Search for topics you are interested in and either improve the page for them, or add a new page.
  Edit the page Davis with some information about the town, for people who dont know anything about it.  Add links to Town History, Davis Timeline, Campus, Peoples Republic of Davis and whatever else. Think of how you would give a tour of the town, or explain the town to someone.
  Help the UC Davis page not suck!  Campus currently contains a lot that should be in UC Davis.  Campus ought to be just that: physical stuff, oncampus stuff.  UC Davis ought to be more general. Share what it interesting and unknown about what is going on in your department.
  Secret and underground passages  how about a page or two on the underground passages that connect buildings together?  Allegedly theres also some underground way of getting to the UCD airport from Mrak Hall Mrak, but this may be just a  legend.  Users/JaimeRaba jr This can be confirmed as legend, but document the few passages that are real.
   See no toad sexing in Davis for an interesting (and true) story about underground passages on campus.  Users/DanMasiel
   There are a number of websites (http://www.infiltration.org/ for example) devoted to this very activity.  It would be cool to see what people have gotten themselves into in this city.
  Wiki your Department. Im not really sure how good of an idea it would be to have people start noding Classes and Professors, but for right now theres certainly no reason for something like Psychology to be so barren.
  Wiki your Complex or your Streets street. There are a ton of Apartment Complexes linked (though just as many still need to be), and hardly any of them have pages.  Remember when you were looking for a place?  Wouldnt it have been awesome to hear what people had to say about the various apartments?  The good, the bad, theanything?  So create a page on your apartment complex and add it to Apartments!
  Help with the Front Page. Help to keep it organized and focused on content about Davis.
    There is currently an Explore Sandbox for working out a better version of Explore and suggestions.
    (likewise, making a copy of Front Page and naming it Front Page Sandbox would work for suggestions to the front page).
    Help us pick a Featured Page!  Think a page is cool?  Or a page has potential to be awesome?  Then spice up the page and suggest it in Next Featured Page!
  Photos  Many pages contain no photos.  In general, we need photos for most everyplace.  While finding a random photo online might do for now, for lasting purposes, we need our own photos.  Search for Photo Requests photo request to see where people really want a photo.
  If youve only got 5 minutes, pick one of these pages: Wanted Pages and write it up.  Or, add a link to a page with 0 links in Outgoing Links, or find an Orphaned Pages orphaned page and link to it from another page!
  Add wiki:wikispot:Help with Maps maps everywhere on the wiki, since were switching mapping systems. Use the {{{Address()}}} macro to do this.
  Add categories to Students High School Students i.e. Current, Continuing, Independent Studies
  Call apartments to ask about their MonthtoMonth Rental Agreement policies.  A definite yes and no list would be helpful there.
  Welcome to the Wiki Welcome a new editor. Reach out and help to build community.
  Fix outgoing links for old archived news articles. Old outgoing links to articles often become broken when website content is shifted around or completely deleted by a webmaster. In particular, California Aggie and Sacramento Bee are notorious for making their articles unavailable after a couple years. We should fix this by linking to archived versions of the same articles available at http://www.waybackmachine.org or http://www.newsbank.com. The Davis Enterprise paywall can be skirted by linking to google caches of articles.

 Appearance, Grammar and Flow 
  Spell checking  Correct spelling and grammar in main articles.  Fixing typos is especially easy using http://downloadfirefox.org/ Mozilla Firefox, where unrecognized words are underlined with red dots. (Note: Editing comments, even if just to fix spelling, is generally considered tacky.)
  Fix links  Click on external links to see if they work.  If a particular link doesnt work, remove the broken link and do an internet search for a working URL.
  Archive old comments and reviews
    Or dont: integrate them into the entry or try and organize them.  Delete worthless comments.
  Linking  A reason why wikis work so well is that you can easily navigate between related topics, but only as long as linking is prolific and consistent.

 Other Suggestions and Questions 
   Useful information  The following statistics would be useful in figuring out what pages we should try and put into more of a hierarchy of pages, given attention to... and other development:  a sorted/sortable page of data indicating the number of hits per page, are the largest in size, have the most photos, how many times edited.   Users/JaimeRaba jr
   Make it possible to edit events that you post (rather than delete them)  Users/ArlenAbraham
   On the Orphaned Pages page for redirects show in parentheses which page is the target for each redirect.  Users/JasonAller

 Links to places 
  We need to go through a lot of the stuff on the wiki and make sure its as linked up and wellorganized as we can.
  Need a good place to put Title Index and some other important organizational tools.  We could put them on the Front Page in Explore but we need to reorganize Explore in few weeks (maybe).
    Site Organization
  So we have some awesome new Welcome to the Wiki pages.  But how do new people get there.  It seems like most of the important information comes from starting with Introduction (from the front page), and continuing on to Davis Wiki Guide.  It seems like the Welcome subpages are only used now to tell someone theyre wrong.  Can we make it a little more prominent?

 Off the Wiki 
  consider helping with outreach efforts
  introduce someone to the wiki
  help with Farmers Market Tabling

 Wiki Development To Do 
   external link in visual editing toolbar should act similar to AIMs link UI.  Also, perhaps a few more items in the visual editor.


20050217 19:31:47 nbsp http://daviswiki.org/index.cgi/Abandoned_20Pages causes a crash report Users/JasonAller
   I know.  Mike said hed fix that a long time ago but hasnt done it.  Hence why were going open source :)
   20090125 14:44:44 nbsp still not fixed. Users/JasonAller

20050513 14:08:50 nbsp The events page should allow you to specify a time range for an event, so that it doesnt drop off the page the moment the event starts. This would be very useful for allday events where participants arent really expected to stay the whole time. Users/JessicaLuedtke

20050612 14:24:12 nbsp The map would be awesome if you could scroll from place to place instead of just zooming in once, sometimes twice, to see certain spots, especially those areas on the outter rim of an areas cutoff, that would make the map a little easier and userfriendly. Thats my two cents. Users/MichelleAccurso

20050724 19:20:11 nbsp Ive been adding the box to put in reviews and comments to a bunch of places where I noticed there were none.  Is it possible to just have that be a part of the template for businesses and such?  Or even for every page?  Or should every page not have a comment section?  Personally I like the Comment box because of the timestamp thing, especially for reviews.  It makes wiki easier for newbies to share. Users/IrenePark

20060212 19:03:25 nbsp I just made a page for the Davis Chorale, whose Vespers performance I went to this evening.  But there seems to be no page for Classical Music Groups or anything like that to link to it.  It seems that the musicoriented pages are pretty focused on college bands.  I dont know enough to even really get started, but it would be great if we could have pages about classical groups, too. Users/DanielBrown

20060321 18:03:03 nbsp how about making comments reverse chronological (recent to oldest) that way we see most relevant/recent comments, suggestions, observations without scrolling down? Users/LookyLoo
  No.  Comments currently work by appending to the end of the page, and this would be much harder to code.  Also, it encourages unthreaded conversations (are we supposed to thread up?).  If comments no longer apply, they should either be integrated or (probably) deleted. Users/BrentLaabs

20060329 10:45:39 nbsp What about a Literature page? I want to make one but I dont know how and Im not sure if Id have enough time.  Users/JoshFernandez

20061213 05:31:19 nbsp You should make a quicklink button!!  Users/JoyDomingo
 How would you want to see that work? Right now theres an external link button that inserts {{{http://www.example.com}}}. The best implementation of this I can think of is some sort of suggested links interface where, for example, the word Chipotle is used on a page, it would suggest a link.  Users/ArlenAbraham

20070320 11:06:10 nbsp Boredom can be remedied on the Wiki in much more beneficial ways, but one can perhaps undertake the task of alphabetizing the People page by last name, presumably. Users/LeonardMarque

20090210 11:41:31 nbsp i am trying to get to the departments of medical practices and i keep getting crap. Users/sylviatanner

20120320 07:34:11 nbsp http://calrice.org might be worth connecting to the rice fields out by the Causeway. Users/JabberWokky

20130315 12:12:41 nbsp Im would like to create a new page for my complex, but dont know where to start! Please Help! :) Users/AngelDonovan

20130315 12:17:56 nbsp I found by searching an apartment complex template, can I use that to get started, or is that just an example? Thanks for your help!! Users/AngelDonovan
   Easiest way is to search for the name of the complex.  If it doesnt show up, the first options above the search results are to create a new entry by that name.  When you do, you can choose from any of the templates.   What is the complex?  Im surprised there are any that dont have an entry already.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

The name has changed. I asked previously and I was told to create a new page and leave the old as reference. (Americana Arms ... now Academy Lane) Thanks!
