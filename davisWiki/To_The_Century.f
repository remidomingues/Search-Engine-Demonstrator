To the north, to the east, to south, to the west, to the hills, to the bar, to the century! For 30 days Gregg Whelan and Gary Winters of Lone Twin will take a daily sixhour bike ride through Davis and the surrounding area. In honor of the UC Davis Centennial and in an attempt to document the life and times of the city and the university, the intrepid pair will present a nightly dispatch detailing the day’s events. They’ll share stories of a city at work, a city at play, stories of the brave and the humble, stories of sore legs, tired eyes and the puncture repair kit.

A new fiveminute installment will be added to the show each evening; visit and revisit as this marathon event accumulates and help the pair raise a thousand toasts to Davis.
