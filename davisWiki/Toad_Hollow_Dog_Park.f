Toad Hollow Dog Parks Dog Park is a fully fenced offleash area with street parking along the southern periphery as well as limited parking within Toad Hollow. It is accessed via Kendall Way. This facility has a doublelock entry gate leading into the large dog area and a new doublelock entry gate leading into the small dog area, drinking fountain with additional hose bib for pets and trash stations with plastic bags; park users are encouraged to bring their excess plastic grocery bags to ensure a steady supply of bags. There is a limit of three dogs per person. Parking includes two disabled parking spaces and ten regular spaces on site and thirtyfour spaces along 2nd Street. The park is expected to be open yearround except when flooded. Important Notes: The pond area of Toad Hollow is off limits to dogs. Additionally, if the city finds that more than 75% of users fail to clean up after their dogs, a site monitor will be assigned to police the facility. On the afternoon of April 30, 2005, the City of Davis formally hosted the grand opening celebration of Toad Hollow Dog Park preceded by a fourhour SPCA fundraiser walkathon.

Toad Hollow Dog Park was won through years of Davis dog owners attending City Council meetings that often left owners in chambers until almost midnight, hours spent planning and identifying potential locations that werent wanted by any other local groups, meetings with Parks officials and reviewing strategies used in other cities, and even calculating the number of dogs in town per capita. Locations identified years earlier were snatched away midprocess by groups such as the Sierra Club. This project received tremendous support and encouragement from the Parks department while councilmembers were pretty lukewarm on the concept of a citysponsored dog park. Park users should keep in mind that this park exists only by virtue of all those who continued the struggle in a public and very divisive forum and, as Davis cemetery history has shown us, it takes just a few persistent voices to lose this valuable resource.

The name referred to on the signs is the Core Pond Dog Park.  The more common name Toad Hollow Dog Park comes from the fact that the Toad Tunnel Toad Tunnels empty out into the area.

News & History
 On the afternoon of April 30, 2005, the City of Davis formally hosted the grand opening celebration of Toad Hollow Dog Park preceded by a fourhour SPCA fundraiser walkathon. The 3kilometer walk began at Community Park at 8am.For more information about the dog park or other offleash areas, contact the http://www.city.davis.ca.us/pcs City of Davis Parks & Community Services Department (530/7575626).

 In early 2006 the City of Davis Parks & Recreation conducted a http://www.cityofdavis.org/story/?storydogparksurvey user survey at Toad Hollow Dog Park. The Recreation & Park Commission reviewed results of the 300+ Toad Hollow survey respondents and made http://www.cityofdavis.org/meetings/councilpackets/20060613/05S6_RPC_051806_Minutes.pdf recommendations to the City Council in June concerning proposed amenities to be included in the Dog Park Master Plan, communication and signage, and additional potential master plan amenities.

 On July 6, 2006, the public was invited to attend and comment on proposed improvements to Toad Hollow and to help develop a master plan for the park based on user desired gathered in a survey staged earlier in the year. Additional community input was gathered and discussed with Parks representatives who will draft a proposed sketch of the area for presentation and further discussion at a followup meeting on July 20 at 6pm most likely at the Hattie Weber Museum; the results of this second meeting will be presented to the City of Davis Parks & Recreation Committee at their August 17 meeting, and the community is strongly encouraged to have a presence at that meeting. Proposed improvements include
  a 6foot wide ADAcompliant walking path along the park perimeter with distance markers for users who would like to incorporate an human exercise aspect
  more trees outside the fenceline to provide additional shade
  permanent benches just inside the fenceline as well as permanent conversation benches beneath existing tree clusters
  a fenced small dog area immediately adjacent to the drinking fountain and including the southeast corner of the park  this area would have a separate entrance and access to drinking water for small dogs
  additional trash cans
  a permanent bulletin board and area for lost/found items as well as some landscaping in this area
  a sign on the pole at the park entrance identifying the park as well as a highly visible flag indicating open/closed status
  a phone number users can call to find out when the park is open/closed

 Some user requests including an additional drinking fountain, plastic bags, restrooms, additional parking, lighting, water feature and dog training equipment were set aside because of logistical issues. Meeting attendees were reminded that the City of Davis does not provide additional funding to support improvements to the area for dog park users; the cost of these improvements are likely to be borne by park users unless alternate funding sources can be identified.

 On July 20, 2006, the public was invited to attend and comment on a master plan for Toad Hollow drafted following a July 6 public meeting. All items proposed at the July 6 meeting were incorporated as well as a dog rinse station in the parking lot. Additionally, the proposed open/closed flag will be flown whenever the dog park is open and taken down when closed. Attendees were very pleased with the finalized plan which was to be presented to the City of Davis Recreation & Park Commission at their Events August 17 meeting  interested community members were strongly encouraged to attend that meeting. Note: The August 17 meeting of the City of Davis Recreation & Park Commission never happened  the finalized Toad Hollow master plan would be presented at the commissions Events September 21 meeting.

  On September 21, 2006, the City of Davis Recreation & Park Commission heard a presentation of the Toad Hollow Dog Park/Master Plan Toad Hollow Dog Park master plan and unanimously voted to support it with the addition of educational signage about the dangers of rinsing shampoo products into the environment. A suggestion was also made and noted by Parks staff that a hitching post be added to the dog rinse station to protect against runaway dogs. Lamar Heystek expressed concern over the potential cost of improvements to the facility but was reassured by commission members as well as Parks staff that the city would not be expected to provide financial support. Instead, funding for amenities will fall upon dog owners and the community  community members interested in helping raise funds or donate toward completion of the master plan should contact Davis Dog Owners Group, who have established a close working relationship with the City of Davis Parks & Community Services Department and can best facilitate funds planning.

  On October 28, 2006, a Halloween party was held at the Toad Hollow Dog Park from 3:30pm5pm. Many dogs arrived in costume, including Mr. Furley (from Threes Company), an escapee from the psych ward in straightjacket, a pimp dog, cookie monster and the Coppertone dog. Prizes were awarded for best costumes in several categories and best dog trick. Photos taken at the event were emailed to attendees at their request. DDOGS and event sponsors had information available for attendees, home baked pupcakes were distributed to all dogs desirous, and everybody went home with treat bags. Event organizers were mailto:dematner@gmail.com Desir√©e and mailto:kushschohan@yahoo.com Kush gave a big thanks to sponsors, Acorn Veterinary Clinic, Animal Kingdom, Fo Paws Fo Paws Grooming, http://www.lsce.com/ Luhdorff & Scalmanini Consulting Engineers, http://www.premierchirowoodland.com/ Premier Chiropractic of Woodland, South Davis Veterinary Center and Watch Dog Pet Sitting Services.

  On May 21, 2012, the City of Davis installed a new gate leading into the small dog area of the dog park.  Funds for the gate were raised at two fundraisers held at Monticello Seasonal Cuisine.  The fundraising planning team consisted of Jan Chess, Lori Malyj, Donna Provenza, Leslie Kurtz, Diane Crumley, and Rhonda Gruska. The Gravems, owners of Midtown Animal Clinic donated the remaining funds needed for the city to move forward with the gate installation.  Go Team!  Due to the success of this team effort, future fundraisers will be held to improve the dog park.  Contact the Davis Dog Owners Group so you can stay informed about upcoming fundraising events for the dog park.

 20070228 nbsp Id advise against it if your dog isnt dog friendly.  There can be a lot of dogs in the area, and when two of them get into a fight its often a mass of dogs that is very hard to get safely at your dog to separate them.

20080812 13:07:30 nbsp This is an excellent dog park, lots of fun.  The plastic lawn chairs are a nice addition.  My dog prefers the smaller dog run at Community Park somehow she is more playful there, maybe she can connect better when there are fewer dogs.  I have heard a A LOT of talk   from small dog owners mostly   about being afraid to bring their dogs here because of aggression.  I know one dog that was attacked, unprovoked, twice.  I dont know the specific circumstances but plead with people to be responsible when they go here & not ruin it for others.  Many people plant themselves somewhere to socialize, text message, read, etc without attempting to monitor their dog.  The park is huge & things can get out of hand quickly.  Also, lack of attention is no excuse for missing dog poops  the corners of this park are frequently peppered with poops.  I know that saintly volunteers pick up regularly after these peoples dogs, so I can only imagine what the place would be like without them.  Users/Dora5

20090113 23:54:58 nbsp RE Fencing & Gravel: While I also was opposed to creating a smaller park w/in a park, the small dog area was a major issue for many community members and came out of many, many community meetings that formed the basis for the Toad Hollow Master Plan. Both this fenced area and the walkway were requested by the community and were incorporated into the master plan. Perhaps more importantly, the walkway makes Toad Hollow more friendly to the elderly/frail and folks with disabilities  the walkway brings Toad Hollow in compliance with the ADA. Its all about compromising to meet the needs of many, right?

Oh, and the lights just arent going to happen. We asked for them throughout the master planning process and were told its not an option, and we continue to bring up the lighting issue. One of the issues with installing lights is that Toad Hollow is the lowest point in Davis... its a natural drainage for the entire downtown area. So its the first place in town that floods. All it takes is one good day of heavy rain to flood the area. We even asked about using existing street light standards to flood the park, but that was nixed as well. Well continue to push for lights, but dont hold your breath. (Lets not even talk about bathrooms! Can you imagine what would happen when the floods come?)

If you really want to effect changes, I encourage you to join Davis Dog Owners Group, or at least subscribe to the list server, where you can find out about opportunities to get involved. In fact, the city of Davis Parks Master Plan is currently being updated (there have already been several community meetings and surveys), and the Parks Commission is scheduled to make decisions regarding the updates this Thursday, January 15.

Oh, and IMO, I also agree that segregating aggressive dogs can be counterproductive, unless the dog truly cannot be controlled. Rather than setting up an aggressive dog for a lifetime of limited contact with other dogs and humans, it seems preferable to invest in additional training. If the training methods these owners have used are not working, they may want to consider different training methods. Some dogs are just smarter than their owners, making them difficult to control! sorry for the overly long post... its been two years coming! Users/AlphaDog

20090119 10:51:43 nbsp My dog loves coming here for an hour a day of play. This place can be overwhelming with so many dogs, but is well worth it if you are attentive and always on doggie patrol. Users/AnneBrowning

20090531 19:13:13 nbsp I love to take my small dogs to the dog park.  The small dog area is perfect on days when there are many large dogs.  My 9 month old chugs (chihuahua/pug mix) Simon and Bowkey can be timid around large dogs.  However they love to watch all the dogs and will run with the pack after a warm up time.  The other great thing about the dog park is that you dont have to worry about the people there, as they for the most part are reasonably well adjusted, as evidenced by their love of dogs.  Users/HazelWatson

20090923 09:19:52 nbsp New to Davis with an adopted German Shepherd from the SPCA who apparently has some anxiety and socialization issues.  Im trying to break him in and slowly build his social skills safely.  What is the best time to visit with the LEAST amount of traffic for undistracted training and socialization? Users/Kiefer

20091015 15:25:56 nbsp Theres usually hardly anyone there if you go sometime in the middle of the afternoon...like from 12pm3pm.  Its the most crowded in the couple hours before sunset.  My dog used to be kind of scared and antisocial when I first started bringing her, but I did the same thing and eased her into it during the really dead hours...and then eventually she worked her way up to being comfortable with all the dogs.   Users/sam120287

20091016 20:17:37 nbsp Some friends of mine at the dog park and I have discussed a really different fix for the bathrooms and pedestrian access issues. Midway down the south side, a pedestrian ramp bridge with its own gate (for closing after dark) could be installed, elevated over the protected wild area, and lead to another doggy airlock gate. Doing this would allow space for a potty at the top, on the level of second street. Peds and pups would also no longer have to dodge 2 cars on a 1.5 lane road walking down to the park. Users/PopeChristof

20100517 21:13:38 nbsp Flat out: This park is horrible for a good number of reasons...and I relocated from a town where their version of a dog park was a dirt field. NOBODY picks up their dogs poo; there are plenty logs waiting to be stepped on every direction you turn. The grass surface is literally a minefield of potholes and poo. I stopped going after my dog ran through a huge hole in the grass and came up severely limping...and after I stepped in a nice fat pile for the 174th time. There is a track going around the park if you want to walk, but the entire entryway is made up of crushed river rock, which Im certain cannot be comfortable for dogs to walk or run on.
Most owners are responsible, but there are quite a few irresponsible ones who like this park. There are a lot of people who have no idea how to handle, train and control a dog, yet they still bring them to this park. You are pretty much guaranteed to see at least two dog fights if you spend more than 15 minutes there during twilight. Because the park is so small, you cant throw a ball to your dog without at least three other dogs trying to chase it, and when another dog does get it, its owner will typically act like hey pal, its your problem.
Then theres the Grandma Mafia, usually a group of 510 spinsters who bring their own lawn chairs and believe they hold court over the entire park. They will not hesitate to give you grief about ANYTHING your dog does, and will wax their own egos amongst themselves. They are usually there every weekday evening.
The city decided to install a small dog playpen in the southeast corner, which effectively removed about 30% of the park. The grandmas take up one entire corner for themselves typically, and the other corner is by the entry way, so you have very little open space for your dog to run around in unless you are able to go in the middle of the day or early in the morning. I will say however that the small dog area is the only good thing this park has going for it...if you have a small dog. Ive heard of numerous cases of cars being broken into in the parking lot, so be wary of that too.
Bottom line, there are other offleash areas around Davis that are head and shoulders above this designated debacle. And typically the people and dogs at these other parks are generally A LOT nicer to be around.

20100622 13:39:29 nbsp So far as dog company, this place is hit or miss. Sometimes its loaded with great dogs and owners and sometimes not. Last week some lady talked on her cell phone the entire time she was there while her dog was being aggressive with the others. Guess I figured out why some people leave after only being there for a couple of minutes. Facility has been clean for the most part, but beware of the land mines if walking through the grass. Wish the water hose was a little closer to fill up the buckets with clean/fresh water. Oh yeah, if your dog knocks over the water bucket, please be courteous and refill it for the others.  Users/103

20101023 19:15:59 nbsp I have nothing but good things to say about this dog park. I own and operate a pet sitting business and come to Toad Hollow at least once a day sometimes as many as 3 times a day. The dog park provides a wonderful social opportunity for dogs and their owners. Puppies learn to interact and play with older dogs and puppies a like. Owners can chat about their dogs and behaviors. Most dogs that come to the park are well mannered and owners are very responsible about picking up after their dogs. Out of my three years of coming to the park, I have only seen one small fight as they are very rare. For the best experience go early in the morning between 711 or after 8pm when the work crowd has left to avoid any potential problems. DDOG puts on a wonderful fundraising opportunity to raise money for the park around Halloween time . On the weekends, there is doodle day and sometimes the dog park regulars have a breakfast social. It really is its own community and you should come out and meet all  the wonderful people and watch the dogs at play.   Users/ElizabethBarthel

20101213 12:32:59 nbsp Overall this park is a positive place.  Most people Ive met are friendly and know a little bit about dog behavior.  My biggest pet peeve is probably the people who bring their dogs and freak out when they playfully wrestle with other dogs.  Get a grip people.  Dogs wrestle.  99% of the time a dog will yelp/whine if it wants to stop and the other dog stops.  I hate the people who get mad when their dog is happily playing and either yell at their own poor dog or yell at you.  I occasionally see scuffles where dogs need to be separated but in my experience most owners separate the dogs, let them unwind for a bit, and everything is fine again.  I think Ive seen 3 actual dog fights in 3 years.  In all cases their was a particular dog with a serious issue and the owner ignored the signs.  The most memorable was a large, muscular, aggressive dog (Im not talking about play growls, wrestling, etc, I mean a dog that was trying to pick fights and had to be pulled away several times).  The dog attacked another wellsocialized dog that Ive seen multiple times.  The wellsocialized dog beat the crap out of the other dog, and when the owners of the aggressive dog left the other dog went right back to happily playing.

Another tip: its generally a bad idea to bring an onleash dog to an offleash dog area.  Sometimes it works ok if you have an attentive owner bringing a dog during offpeak hours if the dog needs a minute to unwind.  However, a lot of dogs are fearful on leash, especially when you have a lot of offleash dogs running around.  Also, if something does happen you are more likely to be liable because you are the one causing the issue (offleash area and not following that guideline).  Take your dog during offhours.  Most people are very friendly.  Ive had several people warn me that they were trying to socialize a newer dog and its always been fine.  We have dogs too, and we understand the need to socialize :)  If you are attentive to your dog you can give your dog a positive experience by praising good behavior and stopping bad behavior before it has the chance to cause a problem.

Unfortunately you always have the occasional idiots who bring their leashed dogs to offleash areas and freak out when other dogs approach.  But hey, you cant please them all.Users/themichelle

20110718 10:28:18 nbsp While this dog park is large and fun for the dogs, the way the city maintains and cares for the park is incredibly frustrating. They removed all of the water buckets for the dogs to drink out of, leaving only a clogged, muddy (people) drinking fountain in the far corner of the park, that many dogs turn their noses up at due to the filthy hot water. They have also removed all lawn chairs that were generously donated for people to sit on. New benches have been installed, however, most of them are in direct sunlight and are uncomfortable to sit at in the summer. The park is closed at the slightest bit of mist in the air, claiming that the rain will ruin the lawn if the dogs play on it. It remains closed for SEVERAL days after it stops raining. Also, regular maintenance is done on Monday mornings, during which the park is closed  however, I have yet to see any maintenance work being done during this time. Not to mention the park is NEVER opened up again on time, leaving those of us who frequent the dog park sitting in our cars to wait until the city feels like unlocking the gate. Users/Jmapplegarth

20111030 21:51:30 nbsp We moved to Davis a little more than a month ago and so far we have had a very good experience with this dog park. Our dog is very submissive and got pinned down quite often at the other parks that we have been in in the Sacramento and Los Angeles area. Most of the time in those situations I had to step in to protect my dog while the owner of the offending dog would be somewhere else not paying attention. That hasnt been the case in this park. With a few exceptions, owners seem to be very responsible and attentive. If there is an incedent, it ends quickly and the offending dog gets reprimanded. So our visits to the dog park became more frequent and less stressful. Now I enjoy hanging out there almost as much as my dog : )  Users/LisaA

20120316 18:03:21 nbsp Lots of owners here leave tennis balls on the ground that inevitably get broken apart and swallowed by other dogs. Once, an owner actually gave my dog a piece of broken tennis ball to chew on because their dog had his toy. Its a major issue and most owners ignore the scraps on the ground. Please pick up any pieces you see; its a big hazard to curious dogs!

Other than that its a big, open field with friendly dogs (and owners). Users/TimJ
