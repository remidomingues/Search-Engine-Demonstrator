Town and Gown Toastmasters is one of the Toastmasters clubs in Davis that provides a supportive learning environment in which to develop communication and leadership skills. Let us show you how! Were a NonProfit Organizations nonprofit organization run by volunteers, and have a lot of fun in the process of becoming skilled as Public Speaking public speakers and leaders. We meet Tuesdays from 6pm to 7:15 pm at the Hattie Weber Museum, 455 C Street in Davis.


20080909 20:59:08 nbsp Toastmasters has moved from the IHouse to the Hattie Weber Museum as of Sept 9th 2008.  Very friendly people.  Awesome setup they have.  They make guests feel very welcome and at home.  It feels one is among peers when they ask to have a guest speak.  More students should utilize the Davis Toastmasters.  You can learn some pretty fun things besides public speaking.  They have a Joke Master give an opening joke to start off the speeches.  This was the Sept 9th joke that I can remember.

A middle aged couple were having coffee at a small shop.  The couple were very much in love.

The wife asked the husband, If something where to happen to me and you were to remarry.  Would you still live in the same house that we do now?

The husband said, Well the house mortgage is almost paid off.  Yes, we would live in the same house.

The wife asked again, Would that mean she would drive my car?

Well, the husband began, The car is paid off so she would drive your car.

Does that mean she is going to use my golf clubs?

Oh no.  Shes lefthanded Users/GregSiu


Davis now has another Toastmasters club, the Davis Daytime Toastmasters.  The Daytimers have been mentored by the Town and Gown Club and appreciate all their efforts to get the new club started.  Thanks Town and Gown!  Ty Tadano
