It is important, in Travel Agencies whatever country or company you may be in, to toast appropriately. Study these and learn them, for they will serve you well one day as you down that alcohol chang in the Sherpa tent or hang with the locals at a Scottish pub. If you can offer a drink and toast a person in his/her own language, youve made a friend! If you can sing the local songs after tossing a few, youll doubtless be buddies for life.

 Toasting Etiquette 
 Western Europeans from the Netherlands to Bulgaria seem to have a thing about making eye contact when toasting
 they apparently find Americans fairly vulgar for not doing so, among myriad other reasons.
 The first toast should be made by the host.
 The person receiving the toast should remain seated and should not drink to the toast.
 When a guest of honor is being toasted, they stand when the toast is finished and thank the one who gave the toast.
 German rules: It is good toasting style to clink the glass of every single person at the table; however, have eye contact while toasting, else it means bad luck. If two people are toasting, do not toast across them to another person (so that the line of your arm and the other persons  arms would form a cross), because that also means bad luck and is considered rude. And most importantly: Do not, under any circumstances, fill up your (or any other) glass if it is not completely empty yet! If you do so, that means seven years of really bad sex! (Although some people fill up the nonempty glasses anyhow, figuring that seven years of bad sex is better than no sex at all)

 Clean but Amusing Toasts

 As you slide down the banister of life, may the splinters never face the wrong way.

 Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts. Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more. (Proverbs 31:67)
