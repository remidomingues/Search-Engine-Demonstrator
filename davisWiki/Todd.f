20070711 22:53:27 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. May I suggest that you read Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner? Users/JasonAller

20131112 22:14:59 nbsp You might want to reread Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner.  Content on the wiki is written by the community, and since the wiki is a registered nonprofit, cant be promotional in nature.  Im thinking your recent edits had good intent, but probably need to be cut back quite a bit to fit into the nonprofit category. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20131112 22:25:16 nbsp Fixed that for you.  I can also tweak the image a bit to see if I can get the contrast looking a little nicer. Users/JabberWokky

20131112 23:36:22 nbsp I like the new image.  You probably want to change the wording to third person (They, instead of We), so that when other people edit the entry, it doesnt look like youre saying what they add. Users/JabberWokky
