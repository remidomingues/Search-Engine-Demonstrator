20100602 19:44:53 nbsp  Welcome to the Wiki. Sorry, the welcome is a little late. It looks like a comment you left on the Davis Computer page has been removed by Users/Khanh. It sparked a bit of discussion at Users/Khanh/Talk. Users/JasonAller

20110106 13:14:40 nbsp Toddplease dont delete peoples comments. If the issue has been resolved, please simply add a comment to your page explaining has been resolved. When you simply remove the comments, it could appear that you have not addressed the issue and could cause a misperception. Thanks Users/PeterBoulay

20110106 21:25:39 nbsp Well then why dont your leave a comment.  She got her $265 back.  I felt that it was no loger relivant.  Besides since that Khanh removed my comment from his page then why cant I be able to remove one.  Also I dont thing that comming from me would be enough as it would be better comming from her.  I dont think that she would be agreeable to leave a comment.  Ive just written her off as a customer.

I had so many problems with a lot of Seagate hard drives that I bought going bad that I stopped using them.  I only use Western Digital.  I dont think that it is possible to get her to understand. Users/ToddJames
   ToddWhy would I leave a comment about a business transaction YOU had? Just leave her a comment about the issue by editing and typing it in right under hers.  Then leave it at that. PeteB

20110113 19:45:25 nbsp Please read Welcome to the wiki/Business Owner, and you will see that the edits you made on the Computer Depot page were not appropriate.  Thus, I restored the page to the way it was.  However, please feel free to add content (information about your business) that is not promotional or an advertisement. Users/CovertProfessor

20110117 12:18:21 nbsp What would you like changed? Users/PeterBoulay

20110119 16:30:06 nbsp Toddplease be aware that Daviswiki cannot be used as a fulltilt advertisement for your businessthe nonprofit status of the Wiki prevents it. You can put up some minimal info and we can try the poster but it will have to be sized appropriately for the page. Users/PeterBoulay

20110119 16:38:45 nbsp Toddthe info you put up was a full blown advertisement with massive detail and the such. The very content of what you put upas I saidviolates the rules about using the Wiki for Advertising. Sorry friend. Users/PeterBoulay

20110119 17:01:56 nbsp Keep in mind you can always view past revisions of any content on the wiki by going to that page and clicking the Info icon next to the title.  Past changes, with a full log of activity, are always visible. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, jw.dw@timewarp.org

20110119 22:13:39 nbsp Im not sure if this answers your question to Pete, since Im not sure what edits/comments/pages are involved, but it might help: As a general rule, users have nearly complete control over content on their own user pages (Users/ToddJames, for instance).  Thats distinct from a page about a person, a business, or anything else on the wiki.  There are occasionally disputes over content on a user page, most often when someone is deliberately being obnoxious by either deleting attempts to communicate with them, or repeatedly making unwanted changes to someone elses user page.  The general practice is to let people control their own page, though, even if theyre being rude about it.

By contrast, people are not free to remove valid comments from nonuser pages (such as a page about a business)particularly not anyone with any sort of direct interest in the business.  That goes for both the owner/employee/whatever of the business, and for competitors.  Sometimes there are problem comments, where someone is just outrageously rude, or makes obviously ridiculous accusations, and those get removed.  Even then, though, just for the sake of appearances, its better if someone who isnt directly involved does the deed. Users/TomGarberson

20110120 12:00:06 nbsp ToddI am one person on this WikiI dont read each and every page. If you can tell me which page specifically you are referring to, Ill be more then happy to look at it. Users/PeterBoulay

20110120 15:42:50 nbsp Toddregarding your concern over Users/Khanh, I am going to request you discuss that matter with Users/JabberWokky as he appears to be more knowledgeable over past issues you have had with that person and their business. Thank You. Users/PeterBoulay

20110120 17:16:54 nbsp Toddyoure switching up on me and confusing me. Previously you specifically mentioned Users/Khanh and now youre changing the issue. On your business page, you deleted negative comments you didnt like from your profilejust because someone says something you dont like it does not mean you can delete it. Users/PeterBoulay

20110120 19:13:26 nbsp Toddas to your concerns about Users/Khanh I will refer you to consult with Users/Jabberwokky as that was a much different situation that I have not had an opportunity to read all the way back on. As to your situation, I have explained why I took the actions I did in an earlier comment about the Wikis NonProfit Status. Please reread itas well, please see Users/TomGarbersons comment earlier. Im going away for a few days and will be unreachableUsers/PeterBoulay

20110802 07:43:36 nbsp Maybe you could http://daviswiki.org/Computer_Repair?actiondiff&version2285&version1284 stop http://daviswiki.org/S%26S_Computer_Repair?actiondiff&version219&version118 messing http://daviswiki.org/Computer_Repair?actiondiff&version2283&version1282 around with info about your competitors. Especially since you have already been asked in the past to stop treating Computer Depot as your own personal http://daviswiki.org/Computer_Depot?actiondiff&version261&version160 advertisement and stop http://daviswiki.org/Computer_Depot?actiondiff&version259&version158 deleting comments you should know better. Thanks. Users/MeggoWaffle

20110802 08:48:49 nbsp Hey, Todd.  You should be aware that because of your ongoing vandalism of the wiki, /Talk somebody has proposed that you be banned.  Even if it doesnt carry through, I would highly recommend that you cease vandalizing and removing content for apparent commercial ends and to advance your business at the cost of your neighbors.  The wiki is not commercial in nature, and although businesses are welcome here, it is critical that everybody have respect for others in Davis and good intentions toward any subject being edited (even if a negative aspect is being presented).  Removing content in an attempt to remove competitors from the community project that is the wiki is especially troubling, and I sincerely urge to to cease such edits. Users/JabberWokky

20110802 08:50:26 nbsp Let me add that I agree completely with what MeggoWaffle and JabberWokky said. Users/CovertProfessor

20110802 20:00:17 nbsp Todd removed the S&S again this evening. I now support a ban on him Users/PeterBoulay

20110802 20:32:59 nbsp Toddaside from your business conflict with S&S, we do not allow people to remove others business listings from the Wiki over this type of an issue. You have been requested SEVERAL times not to do this. Please let this serve as your final warning if you do it again a ban is a very real possibility. Again please leave the Wiki out of your issues with S&S. Thank You Users/PeterBoulay

20110802 20:33:10 nbsp Im sorry you feel that way.  It really isnt appropriate to use the wiki as a weapon.  Please dont vandalize the work of others.  If you feel you cant help it, I would respectfully suggest that you might consider wiki chill pill walking away for awhile until youre calm enough to edit the wiki. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, jw.dw@timewarp.org, (814) 8898845

20110802 21:32:36 nbsp I do have sympathy for your situation, actually.  But it sounds like one of those things that happens in life.  You werent able to take over the property sooner, and they got it first.  It sucks, but thats the way the business world works.  It might be unfair in some sense of the word fairness, but it doesnt sound like anything illegal or even unethical happened.  Unless there is more to the story that youre not telling us.   Users/CovertProfessor

20110802 21:44:08 nbsp Im sorry to hear about the problems youve run into with leasing a location.  Im not sure what deleting the other companys entry is going to do to resolve that, though.  The long and short of it is that this is a community resource that tries to document everything in Davis.  People arent reverting your changes because theyre insensitive to your troubles, but because A) this isnt the place to fight that fight, and B) it wouldnt do any good even if it was the right place.

Seriously, what do you think its going to accomplish? Users/TomGarberson

20110802 22:06:24 nbsp Another thing to keep in mind is that the entry youre vandalizing isnt theirs  its the work of, and owned by the community.  Youre not hurting them, youre lashing out and damaging a shared project that is not theirs.  It sounds like youre obsessing over them (Ive certainly laid awake nights, unable to get a thought out of my head... its part of being human), but youve accidentally tripped across a community effort to document Davis, and are attacking your neighbors instead.  This is not a business listing site.  If you have a legitimate grievance, look at the comments above... people are asking you for details  if its reasonable, the wiki is a perfect place for such things.  Right now it just sounds like they rented a spot before you by coincidence and youre upset you missed out on the spot.  Reasonably upsetting, but unless youre leaving something out it doesnt really seem like cause for vandalizing an open project about the town. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, jw.dw@timewarp.org, (814) 8898845

20110802 22:30:27 nbsp Hi Todd, sorry to hear about your situation. Your complaint really is with the leasing agents for Westlake Plaza, so http://daviswiki.org/Westlake_Plaza is the place to post your story if you feel that will help your business. Users/DonShor

20110803 09:07:59 nbsp I think everyone can understand your emotional reaction to the situation  I know that I can.  And I know how hard it is to get a business up and running, especially in this economy.  Is your plan, though, to focus your energies on trying to drive S&S out of business?  Its none of my business, but that doesnt sound like a very promising strategy.  It also seems, as others have said, that its the leasing agent you should be angry at, not S&S.  I say this out of concern for you, because it sounds like youre having a hard time, and I wouldnt want to see you waste your energies.  Is there another space in Davis that would work for you, even if its not the ideal space that you wanted? Users/CovertProfessor

20110803 17:19:56 nbsp You sound kinda sinister when you talk about this stuff.  Not sure if thats deliberate.  Just a heads up of how its coming across. Users/TomGarberson

20110803 17:20:30 nbsp Ok, I see.  Well, as a businessman Im sure you know that there is good oldfashioned competition to see who can be the best, and then there are more underhanded tactics.  I guess some people saw your deleting the S&S page as being more underhanded.  I hope that youre simply striving to have the best business that you can. Users/CovertProfessor

20110803 20:14:04 nbsp Fine with us.  In case you havent noticed, Davis Wiki does not want to be a business listing site  in fact, it is a nonprofit organization.  It is supposed to be for information only, not advertising. Users/CovertProfessor

20110803 20:19:47 nbsp 20110803 20:11:41   Oh, Im really happy because when I typed computer repair in Google, my listing for my site come up before Davis Wiki. Yea Whoa... Just makes Davis Wiki irrelevant to my business as far as getting new business.

Todd I have been staying out of it, but that comment makes you sound like an ass AND demonstrates that you dont understand the Davis Market.  I can tell you that at least with myself and college students I know, we always turn to the wiki before google searches for finding a business.  I get that you are frustrated but I am sick of your insults about the wiki and how irrelevant it is.  Every business I patronize I discovered through this wiki so you should strive to be a positive influence here. Users/OliviaY
Thats what she said...
Word of mouth is powerful in Davis, as far as generating / keeping clients. Shenanigans like this ensure you dont get referrals from the entrenched people in town... Ive kept silent but Ive read everything on the page I just felt the urge to reaffirm what Olivia says  Daubert

20110804 00:46:31 nbsp I will say no more after this.  You can try to argue the facts that an SEO expert will tell you about peoples habits when using search engines or finding what they are looking for.  You may think what Im saying is ridicules.  Ive learned from the SEO experts and what I say is not just pulling something out of thin air.  Most people that come to this space or otherwise wont even know what Im talking about when I bring up the subject of SEO.

There are 2 types of marketing.  Search, like things like Google, Davis Wiki, etc. are passive marketing and is where people go out and actively search for what they are looking for.  The information is out there for people to find.  Active marketing is where I go out and send them information about my business to their home, business, or a place of business.  Active marketing and SEO will play a much more relevant part as for getting new clients than Davis Wiki.  Sorry you feel this way. Users/ToddJames

20110804 08:24:32 nbsp Say whatever you want about your knowledge of marketing, but those same experts will tell you that you cant overcome the negative perceptions youve begun, and continue to foster, here. Users/Davidlm

20110804 08:53:20 nbsp I through with Davis Wiki.  Im disablingling my account forever! Users/ToddJames

20110804 12:09:55 nbsp Ill agree with David and the others...you dont understand the reach of DavisWiki (and apparently arent willing to reach beyond your misperceptions. To be honest, your lack of ability to spell doesnt help. Good luck in your future. Users/PeterBoulay

20110804 12:22:20 nbsp Young Todd may think hes through. But once you start down the Davis Wiki, forever will it dominate your destiny. Users/ScottMeehleib

20110804 14:15:31 nbsp Hey, at least the vote on banning him didnt have to come to fruition. Users/MeggoWaffle

20110804 14:36:54 nbsp My understanding is the more you search something in Google, the higher itll appear in the search results. Its likely hes getting his business as the first result because hes been searching for his own page so much on Google. Users/TimJ

20130501 20:32:27 nbsp Toddyour pics werent formatting correctly so I reuploaded them and recoded the display info on your page. Nice pics! Users/PeteB
