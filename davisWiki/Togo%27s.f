Togos eateries offer sandwiches, soups and salads. Try a 24 on white with wasabi sauce. In addition they offer catering services in the form of tray preparation.

The Former 2nd Street Togos


There used to be a second location Downtown, on 715 2nd Street.  It closed permanently in June 2008 and was then occupied by Tacos and Beer, Bombay Dreams Restaurant Bombay Dreams which served quite delicious Indian/Nepalese meals, and eventually Preethi Indian Cuisine.

20050529 14:48:30 nbsp heh heh, i know when you took that picture. Users/BrianChen

20050625 17:24:01 nbsp Its all about the Avocado and Turkey.  Subway is cheaper, but then you also have less flavor.  It sounds silly to say, but Togos tastes more like homemade.  P Users/JulieEickhof

20050827 15:49:21 nbsp Subway is nasty ... especially in Davis. I cant comment on Davis Togos but in my experience Togos is better in general. SS

20051004 14:34:50 nbsp Never met a Togos sandwich I liked.  Bland, bland, bland.  But then, Im not a fan of pastrami. Users/AlexPomeranz

20051216 10:21:43 nbsp I feel like its no different than subway Users/JoAnnaRich

20060105 17:39:37 nbsp the best meatball sub in Davis.  The hot #9 is good too. Users/DudeNude

20060214 09:50:37 nbsp The #24 is more popular, but I really suggest you get a #11 instead.  Trust me. Users/JessicaRuygt

20060219 15:23:08 nbsp Well, Ive been to both Togos ... the only thing that Ive found memorable is their Turkey Avocado ... and I find the one at Quiznos to be far superior. SS

20060826 15:23:51 nbsp At the Marketplace location, you better speak audibly and clearly and tell her that you want the sandwich exactly how its described in the menu. If you wanted produce, youd ask the worker for them. If she adds them anyway, she should have the decency to remake the sandwich from scratch rather than merely picking out the majority of the produce. I dont know how many times I repeated as its described in the menu just to get a halfassed sandwich. Oh. And if she interrupts you while youre correcting her with Ill remake it, she doesnt actually mean that shell listened to you. Shell still make the sandwich however she wants it. Not as you want it. Unbelievable. Users/LiRic

20060827 23:27:55 nbsp If you dont have rye bread you shouldnt be selling a rueben. Togos has really gone downhill in the past 10 years. Users/JimEvans

20070111 12:53:50 nbsp The one Downtown has taken a downward spiral over the last year or so.  I have worked nearby for about four years now and I have to say the last couple times I have been in the service was horrible, the place was dirty and the employees were rude.  This has happened a couple of times over 8 months or so.  I wouldnt normally hate on a place so bad. Users/JarrettNoble

20070124 13:26:28 nbsp The Downtown store is not good. Dirty environment, chinzy veggies on the sandwiches. I always go to the one at the Marketplace. Users/AyjaySmith

20070719 13:35:17 nbsp Togos is great better than anyother sandwich shop in my opinion i have tried all the rest but the salami sandwich wins me over the meatball is good like the breads Users/dickjones

20070814 21:10:17 nbsp I asked about getting two 6 foot sandwiches for an upcoming party. I was quoted $12/foot. But if I order a large sandwich, which I think is about one foot, its half that price. What gives?

20070815 08:42:43 nbsp Anybody know if they sell coffee?  And if so, is it Dunkin Donuts coffee? (They are owned by Dunkin Donuts) Users/JabberWokky

20071121 19:32:31 nbsp I love the Marketplace one. There are some people that make my sandwich perfect and there are some that dont and I usually try to get the women, they for some reason make the sandwiches perfect. Users/MustangLisa05

20080118 20:07:33 nbsp Love the Marketplace one. Always friendly service, and no snide remarks about how plain I like my sandwiches. Users/AbbYu

20080206 11:01:57 nbsp togos sandwiches have a flavor that generally appeals to me.  #9 (hot pastrami) is my fave.

i wish they served coke instead of pepsi... Users/herzchen

20080321 18:29:03 nbsp The Downtown store adds a Tip line onto your receipt when you pay by credit card and the Marketplace one does not. Just a little pet peeve of mine. Users/JonBranch

20080409 10:01:30 nbsp I ordered a large soup at the downtown location, and it seems like they screwed me over. They put the soup in a white dish (for people who eat in the restaurant) and it really didnt seem like a large. Plus I ordered bread with it, and they barely gave me 3 inches of bread, which is nothing. I used to work at a togos, and I know that 3 inches of bread should come with a SMALL soup, not a LARGE. The employee who helped me seemed pissed that she had to put on gloves and give me bread, even though youre supposed to offer crackers or bread with an order of soup. Another employee just stood and stared the entire time, which was annoying. BUT, on the bright side, a male employee offered to give me a water cup when I did not buy a drink. He has done that consistently (I have been to this location at least 3 times), and that shows that someone there knows about customer service.

At the marketplace location, on the other hand, I am given the right portion of soup and bread. When I ordered an endless combo there one day (half a sandwich and a small soup), I was given almost a regular sized sandwich. This isnt consistent though because my boyfriend ordered the same thing and he received a half sandwich.

Basically, Id rather go to the marketplace location!

20080418 12:29:13 nbsp Togos has good quality sandwiches.  My recommendation for a good sandwich is hot roast beef on white bread (its softer than their wheat) with avocado.  From their salads, I like the Asian salad the best (it has a peanutsesame type dressing). Users/YupYup

20080629 11:40:25 nbsp I went to buy a sandwich from the downtown location, but it appears to have shut its door permanently. The sign on the door says to try the one on West Covell and thanks people for their years of patronage, so I assume theyve shut down for good.  Users/Oceaniax

20080824 10:38:13 nbsp Thanks goodness for the Davis Wiki.  I was about to trek over to the downtown Togos and only got on here to check their hours.  Its still listed as open on the togos.com site too!  Kudos to you all for keeping the Wiki so up to date. You just saved me a long walk and an even bigger disappointment. Users/MichaelMacIntosh

20081009 23:09:54 nbsp I went to togos today and it appears they are closed. Does anyone know if they moved to another location. If not its sad to see them close
they had one of the best sandwich.  Users/sue
  The only currently open Togos in Davis, as far as I know, is in the Marketplace shopping center, in north Davis.Users/JoePomidor

20081204 09:45:31 nbsp Love the Marketplace location. Fast, friendly service and only the occasional smile of helplessness when I tell them I only want the meat, cheese, and lettuce on my sandwich. Users/AbbYu

20090724 02:38:31 nbsp My favorite was the avocado and cheese with cheddar cheese...soooo filling!  ) Users/sm0729

20090808 02:14:05 nbsp The Marketplace Togos is great. Good service, all of the staff were incredibly nice and attentive. I will come here again. Users/IdealParadigm

20110804 16:46:57 nbsp Togos (downtown) was the bomb.  #3 Turkey and cheese.  Back in the 80s they would pile on the meat, no skimping back then... barely fit in the bread. Users/OldDavis73

20110919 02:21:17 nbsp This review is in regard to the Marketplace location, as the downtown location is closed.  Service both times Ive been to this one has been pretty slow; only one person out of the three (or more) employees there were actively making things.  Both times Ive been here, the resulting food was delicious and well worth the extra price over Subway.  They arent so skimpy, and the ingredients are better.  While slower, the employees seem much more cheerful (especially when compared to the Subway at University Mall, where they look miserable 90% of the time).  I feel more full from a 6 sub from Togos than from a 12 sub at Subway.  Ill be frequenting this place more often. Users/KurtSassenrath
