About Tom!
Tom was a Pet Grooming Mobile Groomer who used to groom Australian Shepherds for show for many years. He worked with the late Charlene Benjamin and the Fo Paws grooming staff and professionally freelanced dogs dog grooming for a while. He is a UC Davis student planning on becoming a veterinarian and worked to pay his way through school by grooming dogs.

Tom would drive out to your house to groom your dog; he had all portable grooming equipment. He didnt have a grooming trailer, so he would do the grooming in the comfort of your own home. Tom was trained in all types of grooming including custom cuts and trims which ensured that your doggie looked exactly how you wanted them to!

Toms Grooming Approach
There are three things that stand out in my grooming style:
   Calm
  I dont use the alphadominant approach to grooming. I want to create a positive relationship between me and the dog so that even the most wild dog will, with time and consistency, become easy to groom. If a dog doesnt like to be groomed, there has to have been some negative experience associated with grooming in the past. I want to incur enough positive experiences with grooming that there is no longer a need for an alphadominant relationship, but rather a stable, consistent balance between me and the dog.
  Custom
  Now, not many people know this, but Ive been showing dogs since I was nine. Yes, Ive only been grooming as a profession for a small while, but Ive been grooming for the show ring ever since I was young. Through the years Ive picked up grooming from many different handlers and owners and Ive explored a variety of styles and techniques. From this Im able to be extremely versatile with custom haircuts and trims. You tell me how you want it, and I can make it happen.
  Show Worthy
  I always strive to make each dog look as if they were show worthy. In the show ring, one small clipper mark can cost you that first place ribbon  some judges will actually place you last for having an unnatural looking coat. Im used to working under these conditions and it carries through in all of my haircuts. My goal has always been the perfect haircut where: the hair lays in ideal length, shape, and volume without ever looking as if the dog has been groomed. And Im proud to say that Ive achieved that many times before.
