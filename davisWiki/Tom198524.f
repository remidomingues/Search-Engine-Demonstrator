20090819 14:59:17 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy Tom, and Welcome to the Wiki!   My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for the review of CJ Gregor, DDS, but it seems odd that you would have a dentist use the same computer as you and leave roughly the same message right after you.  It looks like youve sockpuppets faked a review.  What happened?  No worries if you did, but if so, please delete that other review; were a community based on trust, and lying to your neighbors is pretty lame.  Otherwise, you might want to clarify the situation. wiki:gnome:Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
