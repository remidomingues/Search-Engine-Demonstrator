Tom is an economics and communication communications double major with a minor in Computer Science computer science. He will be graduating in June of 07 and after a summer break of climbing around the world he is going to attend a law school in the states. He doesnt know which one, yet. It bugs him that he doesnt know.

He likes to rock climb, surf, and complain about not having a motorcycle. Next quarter he is taking SCUBA diving. He likes these sort of things. No one really knows why. They are all both dangerous and expensive. He probably does it to show off to the girls. It doesnt work very well.



Here are a couple pictures of Tom climbing. Hes always looking for belay slaves, er.. partners!
