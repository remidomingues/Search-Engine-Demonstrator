I recently finished building a very energy efficient computer in a cookie tin, which I might get around to making a page for one of these days...  The whole machine  computer and monitor  uses less energy than a light bulb (about 30 Watts for the computer and 32 for the monitor), and has a power source that runs at about 95% efficiency.  It is actually efficient enough that it doesnt even require a fan; the machine runs silent, but for a tiny bit of hard drive noise.  For comparison, most desktop machines sport a power source which eat 150500 Watts, and run at between 60 and 75% efficiency.  (This, by the way, is an area where improvement could massively reduce power consumption in the US.)  A CRT monitor runs at 100150 Watts; a newer LCD uses only 3050 Watts.  To be sure, most laptops are already designed with this kind of energy consciousness in order to keep consumers from complaining about short battery life, and run on 3050 Watts.  This energy savings is supposed to pay for the difference between a laptops and desktops price within 35 years of use.  I built my machine for about $400, and got a refurbished screen for another $150, significantly cheaper than a new laptop.
