Tom Garberson used to be an editor on Davis Wiki.  He still lives in Davis and practices law in Sacramento, but is no longer active on the wiki.  You can reach him at mailto(tmgarberson AT gmail DOT com).

Toms law practice is focused on defense in the medical malpractice and elder care fields, but he does take select personal injury cases.  He also occasionally provides assistance with security deposit disputes.  Feel free to email him with inquiries.
