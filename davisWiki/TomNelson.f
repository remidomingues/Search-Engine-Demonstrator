Name: Tom Nelson

NonProfit Organizations: California Aggie Alumni Marching Band, occasionally the California Aggie Marching Banduh and http://www.amnesty.org Amnesty International

Headquarters: Davis, CA

Personality: Tom graduated from UC Davis with a Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineering mechanical/materials engineering dual major.  He enjoys playing the alto sax with the California Aggie Marching Banduh Banduh and California Aggie Alumni Marching Band Alumni Band.  He was once the kiddie Bands IT Manager.

He is one of the few people going to UC Davis that hails from the Central Coast.  Thats too far north to be Southern California SoCal, too far south to be Northern California NorCal.  Its Central California CenCal.

His take on The THE Controversy: if its a highway, its The 101; but if its Highway 1, its Highway 1 (because The 1 doesnt make sense); and if its an interstate, its I5.  He never heard of http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?termhella Hella, http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?termhecka Hecka or Norcal Rage before coming up to Davis.  Additionally, he enjoys collecting odd words like bamboozle, doubloon and gobbledygook.  He also collects free maps and magnets.



20050610 18:06:17 nbsp Hey there Tom!  I dont really see how you can like Davis Tap Water, especially when not chilled.  Chilled tap water is akin, in my mind, to chilled vodka  drinkable, but only because it keeps you alive.  Regardless, welcome to the wiki! Users/PhilipNeustrom

20081111 13:37:50 nbsp so...say someone who knows how to play the alto sax suddenly has this intense desire to join the Banduh (not unusual, right?)... Is said person allowed to simply bring her sax and start playing at a Monday night rehearsal...or is there some protocol to be followed? Users/ArianeMetz
