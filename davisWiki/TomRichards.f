20110414 20:04:06 nbsp Re: Steven. Hi Steven. Thanks for your interest. See this link for prices and other info: http://rolftoevolve.com/rates/  I offer %10 off on 3 session packages and other incentive packages. I would say that there are not a lot of things out there like Rolfing and the information/attention you get is really a unique thing. Feel free to drop me a line or do a consult for free.

All the best, Tom Users/TomRichards
