The term wiki:wikipedia:feminazi was coined by former Agricultural and Resource Economics Professor Tom Hazlett.  Feminazi became popularized by rightwing radio host, wiki:wikipedia:Rush_Limbaugh, who credits Hazlett in a book as a highly regarded professor and friend who coined the term to describe any female who is intolerant of any point of view that challenges militant feminism.




http://technologysource.org/author/tom_hazlett/ is a rough bio, outdated.  The guys at George Mason University since 2005.
But , Tom Hazlett teaches economics, finance, and public policy at the University of California, Davis, where he is professor of Agricultural and Resource Economics and director of the Program on Telecommunications Policy at the Institute of Governmental Affairs. In 199899, he was a resident scholar in Washington, DC at the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research. He earned his doctorate in economics from UCLA in 1984. In 199091 he was a visiting scholar at the Columbia University Graduate School of Business, and in 199192 he served as chief economist of the Federal Communications Commission in Washington, DC sounds pretty interesting. FCC eh?
