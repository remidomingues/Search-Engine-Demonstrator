Waits daughter, Kellesimone Waits, has some business in the area, which explains why Waits has been seen eating at Cafe Bernardo or going into Tower Records Tower or Armadillo Records.

    Kellesimone Waits was here in Davis as a student doing an independent study on the neurology of mental illness and chemical imbalances for several months. Her dad, Tom did visit and most often could be found at Espresso Roma Cafe Roma on E st, except for the one time I took him and his wife to lunch at Cafe Bernardo. Just setting the record straight.
