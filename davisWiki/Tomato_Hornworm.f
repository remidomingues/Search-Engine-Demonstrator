I knew these things really existed!  When I was a kid, my dad grew tomato plants and there were always lots of giant green caterpillars on em.  I havent seen one in years, and was starting to credit their existence to an overactive childhood imagination.  Yeahpost a photo, Users/ArlenAbraham Arlen! Users/SummerSong ss

Not the best picture  my camera kept wanting to focus on the background instead of the hornworm.  This guy was about 2 inches long and about as big around as 2 pencils side by side.  I squashed about twenty or thirty of these guys this year.  Ive never heard of the basil trick, but I had a volunteer basil come up this year right next to my tomatos, and the hornworms are gone.  Coincidence?  Seasonal?  Mystery solved?  Hornworms also come in a tobacco variety.  Users/AlexPomeranz

Growing up in North Davis my dad used to (and still does) grow Tomatoes in his seasonal veggie plots, as a kid I would find and remove these worms, they would get pretty damn big  Users/StevenDaubert
