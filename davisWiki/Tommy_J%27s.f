20071129 15:13:37 nbsp Words cant express how amazed I was at the quality of the burgers here. Absolutely the best burger in Davis. InNOut gets the nod if price is considered, but for a few bucks more, the fries are a million times better, the burger is better, and you get a better atmosphere. Its like, wow... this is Froggys? Sooo different when sober. Users/William.Peacock

20071205 23:05:40 nbsp Definitely the best (vegi) burgers in Davis.  The Swiss n Schommer if unbelievable!  They have gardenburger patties and will make any burger with one.  Fantastic! Thanks Tommy J. Users/havanese

20080430 20:22:59 nbsp i was craving the caliburger just now, and i needed the phone number, but i realized they just closed.Rats!! im glad i got offensive service from the owners at burgers and brew, because i probably wouldnt have gone here instead and found a burger that is just as good, if not better. Users/JeffIto

20080508 13:45:31 nbsp Oh hey its my former boss. I had a chicken pesto sandwich. It was really good quality. Im the sort of person whos too picky and shouldnt be eating out, since I like to substitute for things like wheat bread instead of sesame bun, spring mix  or spinach instead of romaine, etc. but thats just me being fickle. My bf had a Philly cheese steak (special, not on the regular menu) with tritip, and swears its one of the best Philly cheese steaks hes ever had. He also loved the curly fries. He keeps bugging me about coming back, so yes, we will be coming back. If anything on the menu looks remotely good to you, you need to go try it. Take a break from Burgers and Brew and give this a try. Its seriously really darn good food. Users/ThuHo

20090726 19:31:36 nbsp Went here a couple weeks ago and it was fantastic!  Had the buffalo blue burger (with bacon), and the rueben.  the rueben is a special, and i highly recommend keeping an eye out for it.  two thick cut pieces of corned beef was amazing!  the burger was super fresh, like they had just ground it that day.  wonderful!  i would recommend (or at least ask next time) for extra buffalo sauce on the burger, and maybe some better bacon, more inline with Alibabas, which is pretty fantastic.  great service and Tom is awesome.  wish we found this place sooner! Users/ADP

20091002 14:29:04 nbsp I called their number and placed my order togo. I was in a rush...

Let me say, first and foremost, Im a Hamburger Man. Ive been to my share of hamburger joints, and I make an excellent burger at home... These were approaching the quality and taste of homemade! The bun! OMG THE BUN! Dont get me started on the bun. The meat tasted good too. The curly fries were just right. Portions were huge.

Best burger joint in Davis. Users/H4rry

20091008 11:47:54 nbsp I LOVE their BLT with chipotle mayo, and Tommy J is a really nice guy.  They deserve to do well!  Much better and MUCH nicer than Burgers and Brew. Users/charliesangels

20100223 18:15:21 nbsp Tommy J catered a wedding I went to.  It was very high quality stuff, excellent tritip and BBQ beans.  He brought a BBQ trailer, plates, napkins, and everything.   Users/DagonJones

20100820 12:39:12 nbsp EASILY the best burger in Davis. I would go here any day over Burgers and Brew. My servers are also always great, pay attention to where you are in your meal without annoying you every five minutes. Users/ColinGoulding

20101025 12:39:55 nbsp I feel cheated that I only discovered this during the summer before my last year in Davis.  The Blue Buffalo burger is my favorite thing in the world to eat (this side of my Grandmas cooking of course). Users/sososharp

20110427 12:59:42 nbsp Best burger in Davis. Burgers and Brew wins in the brew dept, but when it comes to the burgers and fries, Tommy J slays them all.  Users/TheRadish
   Yep, Tommy J.s beer selection is pretty dull, but adequite for the amazing burgers. Burger and Brew needs the beer selection to cover up the lacking quality of their burgers. MichaelNielsen

20110503 02:39:09 nbsp Cajun Bacon Burger with Jalapenos is hard to beat. Love it! Users/CarlosOverstreet

Tommy J has the best burger and service in town, hands down. users/JoshLawson

20110513 14:59:39 nbsp Hands down the BEST Clam Chowder EVER! Users/MandyLWittenberg

20110524 19:23:51 nbsp TommyJs burger was everything I had hoped that Burgers and Brews would be. (I felt queasy eating at Burgers and Brew.. so much grease). Love the fresh buns from Village Bakery with TommyJs meaty patty. Best burgers!!! Our server was amazing too! Users/kestry

20110602 11:35:29 nbsp Not sure why it took me so long to eat here.  One of my biggest regrets in life is spending the last 4 years eating at Burgers & Brew instead of supporting Tommy Js.  This is now the ONLY place in Davis Ill go for a burger.  The Blue Buffalo is soooo good.  Juicy, not greasy.  Chicken Pesto Sandwich is also good.  Service is fast and friendly.  They have a full bar.   I could good go on but it would just me redundant.  In my opinion best burger (especially when service is factored in) in town. Users/WillODonnell

20110619 01:39:54 nbsp Best burger in Davis. Ive tried most all of them, and these ones are super tasty. Plus, Tommy is hilarious.  Users/ChristyMarsden

20110619 09:59:35 nbsp Youve got Preacher, Johnny, Adam and so many others, not to mention the amazing fries (yes, I know its just fries, but how many places cook them the way you actually like them without any special requests to do so???) and the great burgers...  the double BBQ Bacon Burger.. yummy! Users/WesP

20110713 20:35:40 nbsp Id like to confirm the ravings about this place. At first, I was skeptic. We are talking about burgers and fries for crying out loud. There are two types of burgers: the kids burgers that you can buy with a soda, and adult burgers you can buy with a beer. Theres very little variation within those groups. Within the first group, McDonald is the bottom of the foodchain(s, hehe) and then theres Carls Jr. reaching for the style of the adult burgers. For fries, theres the worst I ever had at In and Out, and then the thick crispy ones at adult burger joints. The best burger I had, was at a place near the Spanish Table in Berkeley. It was a Lamb burger and I tried Burger and Brews lamb burger which was a total letdown. Then after reading all these comments about Tommy J. I decided to give it a try. and... O. M. G.!! First I was curious at them serving the lettuce, onion and tomato on the side for me to assemble myself, but I put the salad on my burger and closed the lid on it and sank my teeth into it, and it was an explosion! Imagine a tomato on a grill and you take it off when its about to burst. Then you put your teeth in it and the juices explode! I couldnt believe it! And the balance of the flavors were just perfect. The meat was juicy, the bacon crisp. I had the caliburger, medium fried. The fired were thick and crisp, slightly peppered. Not greasy. Thumbs up! I wish I knew about this place when my wonderful fiancee was here :( Ill definitely go more times before I leave Davis. Users/MichaelNielsen

20110724 18:18:00 nbsp After reading the reviews, I thought I would try it out. First, I read the menu and ordered a BBQ bacon burger. I read that it came with onion rings on it (like most BBQ burgers do).  When I received the burger it had none on it. I asked the waitress and she said that it doesnt come with it. WTF? seriously it says on the menu. I was the only person eating in there. I decided that I would just eat the burger as is, as I dont really need to be eating that much more crap anyway. Well, The bun was soggy and the burger a bit overdone not to mention the lack of ONION RINGS.  I would be lying if I said that this was the best burger in town. I know its definitely lacking in the service department. And no, this isnt me being a disgruntled patron. I just was really expecting more according to the reviews I had read.Users/contour66

20111010 15:14:13 nbsp I am a big fan of Tommy Js burger and definitely one of the many that considers them the best burger in town.  However, the past 34 times Ive gone there over the past 6 months Ive been greatly disappointed in how the burgers were cooked. The first many times I went, they were done exactly how I wanted them (typically Med.Rare).  However, over the past few months, all of the burgers have been coming out Well Done, Med.Well at best. I went again last night, and knowing that the burgers have been overcooked recently, I ordered mine Rare.  To my amazement, it not only came out Well Done, it was quite crispy/charred too!  Not what I want for an $11 burger.  The waitress mentioned that it was a new cook, and it was only his second night, but this does not account for the times over the past few months.  I typically rave about these burgers to people who havent been there, but since April, I havent been able to get it the way I like it.  I really want to keep coming here, so please correct this soon! Users/ADP

20120102 16:30:03 nbsp tommy js has great burgers... yummy fries... outstanding service . Not to mention the menu is hysterical... I love all the descriptions of the many many ways you can get your burger.  for me, meat was cooked to perfection med rare... delicious!  Users/karenmo

20120925 14:34:26 nbsp The worst, greasiest food ever. THe bread was soggy with oil....the kids food, soggy and greasy enough to squeeze it out. I dont know how this place gets so many raves. Yuck. Users/RubieGrayson

20130213 18:17:08 nbsp Best burger in Davis. not the prettiest, not the leanest, but the best experience. And pretty cheap beer Users/Coleseeger

20130816 11:20:51 nbsp Tommys is great!  Ive been a big fan for the past 3 years.  The drinks are priced just right and the food is always delicious and the wait staff always friendly and super efficient.  Im grateful to have a fun and consistent place to go in Davis...much better than most other restaurants in Davis.   Users/CameronMunnally
