Im living in Davis with my fiance whos getting his MFA in theatre. Im an artist, teacher, and arts administrator. If youre interested in fun playtime, check out my improv class at Experimental College.

You might also catch me knitting, doing downward dog at The Bo Tree, biking the The Greenbelt, smashing a forehand on the courts at Covell Park.
