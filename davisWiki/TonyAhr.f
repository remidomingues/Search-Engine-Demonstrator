20100519 01:24:53 nbsp Thats awesome...I dont work tomorrow, but Im actually gonna stop by and see if the outside camera is functional and see if we have video saved for that minute.  I think the North side of the parking lot is by Rite Aid, which would probably not be in frame, but if the act was closer to Dos Coyotes, there is a shot we might have the cement toss on tape.  This would be huge considering how much more serious that act is than the panhandling she is doing now. Users/TonyAhr

20100519 01:29:10 nbsp The caveat is that the time on the camera might not be the same as the time on your security tapes. I mean, people set their watches regularly (those who have them, anyway), but who regularly sets the clock on their camera? I do, but Im a bit unusual. You might have to check the tape around that time. Users/WilliamLewis

20100519 01:50:14 nbsp Given how the date looks like its been set, the times also been set right, too.  Probably a moot comment, really.  (My comment being moot, not the one above!) Users/AlexanderHo

20100519 02:10:21 nbsp Haha, I figured it wasnt going to be right to the second, but as long as that caveat is at least somewhat accurate, I can set it around 22:00:00 and fast forward until that pink hoodie comes into frame.  God I hope we got that on tape! Users/TonyAhr

20100519 19:14:18 nbsp Your awesome brah Users/StevenDaubert

20100525 00:40:33 nbsp Too bad about the tapes!  I saw them there again tonight.  I dont think theyre getting it.

I posted a Scam Alert flyer to the Con Artists page.  Maybe Safeway would be up for posting it in the window.  For that matter, if you guys want to make your own, Im more than happy to let you use the picture.

Either way, Im glad your staying on them too. Users/JamesMadden

20100526 13:08:49 nbsp Ill ask the boss about the flyer.  Im all for posting it, but this is one of those things I should check in about before going ahead and doing.

Do you remember what time and where in the parking lot you saw her the other night?  I want to see if she shows up on video.  Ive been logging all the times she shows up, writing down the exact time and camera she shows up on, just to further the case against her and her accomplices when they do eventually get caught.

I work tonight and will definitely keep a lookout.  Seems like shes been showing up a lot more lately, hopefully we catch her quickly and Davis PD arrives before she bounces. Users/TonyAhr
  Theres probably a good chance they bribed a police officer so they can get a heads up and bail if anything happens. Users/TomGarberson
  You really think they blew their winnings on bribery? I suppose if theyve scammed enough money....

20100526 13:53:29 nbsp Yeah, I doubt they have bribed anyone, though you never know, it would help explain why they havent been caught yet.  Anyway, Ill still call Davis PD as at worst, it will get them out of the parking lot.  I hate thinking that my place of work is a safe haven for thugs to conduct scams. Users/TonyAhr

20100526 17:19:20 nbsp I would die if they tried to bribe the DPD!  Tony, they were at the south end of the parking lot this time, by the creamery and across from the ATMs.  They showed up on the police log so they had a little visit that night. Users/JamesMadden

20100526 22:52:31 nbsp I should add that it was about 10pm on Monday night.  Hope theyre on the tapes. Users/JamesMadden

20100527 00:51:26 nbsp Hmmm...Im pretty sure that we werent talking about bribes earlier, that totally got edited.  Whatever.

Thats a weird spot for them to be hanging out at that late, Im not sure if the Creamery is even open then, and I know Dos closes at 10:00.  Ill have to let them know about her next time Im in, same with Mermaids, itll give me an excuse to get a drink or two :) Users/TonyAhr
