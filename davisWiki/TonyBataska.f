Tony Bataska was born in Chicago and has since lived all over the States. He currently resides in Northern California and plays many shows in the Sacramento and Bay Area Bay Areas. He continues to work on new songs and push himself to play great live shows. Musically, he played piano for three years early in life and got his first bass guitar in eighth grade. Eventually he got his hands on an old classical acoustic guitar and taught himself how to play. He played in a band in high school, and briefly in college as well. At some point he decided to stop seeking out a band and to go at it solo. So far, it has been going great as Tony continues to progress as a Music Scene musician and entertainer.

Tony Bataska is not playing shows in the Davis community at this time
