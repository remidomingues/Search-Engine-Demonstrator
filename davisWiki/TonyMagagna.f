Tony is a lecturer in the English department at UCD, andfor better or worsehe has had many of the current DavisWiki users as students at one time or another. Hes been around Davis for a while, and hes a big fan of the place, so he enjoys learning new things about the area, and contributing new facts himself. He was once a proud member of the Voorhies Hall Voorhies FBombs Ultimate Frisbee team.

Hes also not so sure about writing about himself in the third person...
