20130514 14:19:51 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner Welcome to the Wiki, Tony. On the University Village page, the comments from http://daviswiki.org/University_Village?actiondiff&version2404&version1403 ChriselleJVinson and http://daviswiki.org/University_Village?actiondiff&version2402&version1401 Fakewater both come from the same IP address you are using (12.146.29.230). Please be aware that faking reviews from people who do not live at your complex is unethical and inappropriate. Users/PeteB

20130514 15:47:23 nbsp Hi PeteB  We totally beleive in being transparent and completely agree with you that faking reviews is unethical and highly inappropriate. Although these reviews did come from the same IP address (our computer lab that all of our residents have access to) these reviews are 100% genuine and were written by two different, current residents that truly live here.  Users/TonyWilson

20130514 16:14:29 nbsp Tonythank you for writing back. We appreciate an involved business person. Well find a way to properly label why its the same IP to avoid future concerns on the University Village page. Users/PeteB
