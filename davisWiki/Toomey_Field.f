Toomey Field is a football field located on campus right next to the Hickey Gym and across the street from the Social Sciences and Humanities Building.  It is surrounded by the Woody Wilson Track.

Built as Aggie Field in 1949, it was renamed to Toomey Field in 1962 in honor of Irving F. Crip Toomey, who served as Director of Athletics at UC Davis from 1929 until his death in 1961.  Toomey graduated from UC Davis in 1923 and also served as the Aggies basketball coach (192936) and football coach (192836).

Toomey Field was the original home of both Aggie football and lacrosse. With the new $30 million Multi Use Stadium opening in 2007, Toomey field will now be used only for track and field events.  The new stadium was originally slated to open in 2006, but construction delays meant Toomey Field got to be the home of one last Aggie Football season in 2006.
