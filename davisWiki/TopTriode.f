Describe Users/TopTriode here.

20071005 08:59:14 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki!  Id like to offer you some friendly advice.  You may not realize that every edit you made gets saved.  So, you might want to think about exactly what you want to say before you edit, both for your own sake (it seems as though you said a few things you didnt really mean) and for the sake of the wiki (all the edits create clutter and take up space).
