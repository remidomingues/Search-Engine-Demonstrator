Tor House was the Music Scene musical project of UCD alum Daryl Jason Lazaro from 2010 to 2013.

History
In April 2010, Lazaro began writing songs and recording solo as Tor House, named after the home built in Carmel, California by poet Robinson Jeffers. Using the Tor House moniker, Lazaro released an EP titled Future Endeavors in September 2010.

In 2011, Tor House began playing shows and open mics around Northern California, and opened for bands such as Other Lives, Fox & Woman, Ezza Rose, Foxtails Brigade, and S. Carey (of Bon Iver).

In 2012, Tor House consisted of Lazaro and a rotating lineup of collaborators. The band released an LP, The Immutable Tor House, in September 2012.

As of 2013, Lazaro moved to the Bay Area and began writing new music under the name Oberon Wild.
