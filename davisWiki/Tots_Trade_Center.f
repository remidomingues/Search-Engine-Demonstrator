Bring your babies and kids....Come in and Play!!

Tots Trade Center was a store that sold gently used and recycled childrens items. The quaint little space that Tots Trade Center occupied was filled with a wide assortment of unique baby and kids items, toys, Furniture Stores furniture, and other gentlyused items, including costumes, some Clothing Stores clothing and shoes.  Items were purchased outright from customers for cash or store credit. Consignment was also an option. New items were received on a daily basis so the inventory was constantly changing. Tiny sat outside the store and waved to customers from his big red bench. Customers looking for a particular item could stop in or give the owners a call and they would add the item to the customers Wish List.

Tots Trade Center was first established in 1985. Kelly van Boxtel, who ran the store for 4 years, was pregnant with her daughter McKella when she bought it in 2001. She closed the store in 2005. That same year Just Kidding was opened.  In October 2010, Kelly and her husband Dave opened their office for Kellys Environmental Consulting business in an adorable space at 515 G street. The space was too large for just a small office. Dave suggested they get back into the baby business....so Tots Trade Center was reopened  (across from Hibbert Lumber). You could often find McKella behind the checkout counter eager to help the customers. The store was marked by the beautiful handcarved wooden Tots Trade Center sign above the door made by local artist Jesse Pruet, a.k.a NEMO.
