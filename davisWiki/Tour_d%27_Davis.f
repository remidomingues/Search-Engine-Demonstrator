The Tour d Davis is some sort of roaming Bicycles bicycle awesomeness, described not so much as a race but a rolling party.  Each stop had different challenges.  Things that come to mind: waterballoon launches, mooning, slip & slides, chick races, Bicycling bicycling with capes, BBQing, waterguns, bodypainting.
