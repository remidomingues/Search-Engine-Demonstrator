Tour de Cluck is an annual bicycle tour of Davis chicken coops organized as a fundraiser for Davis Farm to School, which supports local food in a healthy school environment. The fourth annual event will take place on Saturday, May 24, 2014.


The Tour de Cluck Kickoff begins at 9 a.m. at the Davis Farmers Market, US Bicycling Hall of Fame and Central Park.  A Courage to Cluck exhibition, a Fowl Food Fair and a chicken, bicycle and barnyardthemed Art Exhibit and Silent Auction give visitors good reason to linger awhile!

At 10:00am, those ready to head to the coops will gather around one of four pairs of Bicycle Guides which will disperse groups of riders to one of four Coop Loops (neighborhoodcentered clusters of coops) in a bicycle parade.  Coop owners and chicken experts will be at the coops to share their experiences and answer the questions of the chicken curious.  While bikes are obviously strongly encouraged, car travelers are also welcome.  A wonderful extra resource, Chicken Skool Workshops will address all your fowl questions!

The first annual Tour de Cluck with 16 coop stops took place  on May 22, 2010.

 More details 

The coops featured will be presented as a selfguided tour in neighborhood clusters (coop loops!) with most having easy access to Davis’s extensive network of bike paths and bike lanes. In addition to the eggcellent Chicken Coop Crawl, The Tour de Cluck will once again celebrate our best local food purveyors at the tasty Fowl Food Fair at the renowned Davis Farmers Market.

Our Community Education series, Chicken Skool, will feature, among other things, backyard poultry experts to inform your chicken decisions, from breed selection and feeding options to coop design and construction.

And of course, it’s never too early to begin practicing your cluck, bawk and cockledoodledo for the nottobemissed Community Kickoff Clucking Exhibition held on the U.S. Bicycling Hall of Fame “back porch”.  We suggest you begin to form your flock now!
