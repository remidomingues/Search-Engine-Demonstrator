The town of Davis is home to all sorts of citysanctioned art such as murals and sculptures. But theres also a lot of impromptu sort of art lying around there. Some of it, on the whole, is pretty awful. But some pieces are hidden treasures. Here we collect a little of both.

2012 saw a dramatic surge in new town art to create the Transmedia Art Walk.
