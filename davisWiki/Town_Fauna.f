The longer one lives in Davis, the longer one becomes accustomed to the local wildlife. Some are year round residents, others only can be seen at certain times of the year. Local wildlife often inhabits the town flora. Want to know the correct taxonomic classification for one of Davis biota?  Check out http://species.wikipedia.org/ Wikispecies.

Domesticated animals also make up a good number of the animals in town, some of which have their own Wiki Animals personal pages or check out Cute Animals.

Wild Campus is a UC Davis student group that promotes the conservation of Davis native wildlife through community outreach and events, providing opportunities for student research, and habitat restoration projects.

sitting on my porch (University Ave, between A & B) a couple of days ago i saw a falcon attack and eat a pigeon.  most exciting thing ive seen in davis in quite some time.  Users/EllenWoodall

20070718 22:57:35 nbsp Theres some duplication here with the Town Fauna page. Users/CovertProfessor

20071028 21:11:22 nbsp Whatever difference there was, once, between Town Fauna and this page has gone, as CovertProfessor points out.  I think it was once that Fauna included domestic animals and wildlife here didnt, but that is long since gone.  Anyone want to merge them, as well as adding a comment box on Fauna?  There could be a  along side, or a section for domestics, if one is concerned about it.   Else, one cannot find half the information that is really hidden on the other page.  NotTires Users/NotTires

20080424 10:27:26 nbsp I will give merging a shot. Ill bring the flora info over here.  Then should we delete the info there and make it a redirect to here, or vice versa? Users/EmilyH

20080424 10:30:02 nbsp Nevermind.  Looks like Im not allowed to edit this page. Users/EmilyH

20090921 21:54:25 nbsp Isnt that gopher in the pic above? Users/CarlosOverstreet
  Definitely. No moles in sight. Users/jmofro

20110513 03:18:23 nbsp Are moles much of a problem in Davis? Users/CarlosOverstreet
  Users/DonShor Don Shor would know.  I know gophers are a serious problem for some folks in the outskirts. jw
  I have never seen moles here. Pocket gophers are a problem, and some years we get reports of damage from high populations of voles. Users/DonShor
    Adding to the small mammal tally, Ive spotted some kind of shrew in the grassy fields between Olive Drive and the train tracks.  Im comfortable identifying rodents, but moles and shrews are outside my zone of experience. jw

20110514 00:12:36 nbsp So no moles in Davis that we can confirm? Users/CarlosOverstreet

20130221 15:34:18 nbsp Anyone know what (if any) lizards are indigenous to Davis? I wouldnt mind having some in our yard for a) looking at and b) insect control. Users/ScottSchiller

20130508 14:38:47 nbsp Anyone seen Central Valley Red Foxes by Davis?  Users/CarlosOverstreet
