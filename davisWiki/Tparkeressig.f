 Who is this person? 
At the time of writing this (Nov 2013) I am a Senior at UCD. My major is Cruess Hall Design, and I plan to minor in Community and Regional Development, as opposed to my earlier considerations of Art/Art History, Communication, or Theater/Dance. I almost majored in Wildlife Fish & Conservation Biology (WFCB) and International Relations at one point, and entered Davis as an Ag/Microbio planned major. Hopefully that wild mix gives you some overview of my interests and skills.
