Tracey Zeng is a fourth year Political Science and Philosophy double major.

In her time at UC Davis, she has been an Intern/Chapter Chair/Statewide Board Member for CalPIRG, and an ASUCD Senator/Commissioner/Vice Chair/Intern. She ran for Senate with LEAD in the Fall 2007 ASUCD Election, but is now not involved with the party (she helped her roommate, Levi Menovske, run for Senate in the Fall 2009 ASUCD Election as an Independentand he won!)

She is now interning at the State Capitol with Assemblymember Warren T. Furutani, and is planning on studying abroad for 2 quarters in Italy beginning January 2010. She no longer works with CalPIRG (even though she loves them loads!), and her involvement in ASUCD is limited to being a summer counselor for the amazing Cal Aggie Camp.

She likes dogs (especially labs!) but sadly doesnt have the time to raise one herself. BUT if you ever need a dogsitter, let her know. She also likes new friends, so you should facebook friend her or email her at trazeng@gmail.com!!
