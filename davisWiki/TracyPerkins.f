A Bit About Me: I am a recent graduate of UC Davis majoring in Design with an emphasis in graphics. For the past three years I was a driver, dispatcher, and manager for Unitrans. Primarily I drove in the mornings and usually was driving a DoubleDecker Buses doubledeck. I enjoy climbing late in the afternoon at http://www.touchstoneclimbing.com/sp.html Pipeworks, although these days I dont live in Davis and that makes it rather hard to go climbing.

During my 6 full years in Davis (Fall 2001 through SSII 2007), I have been heavily involved with a number of student groups including Aerobrick and The Co/LAB. As a graduate I am looking to obtain any design work available to me. I can still be found at various Cafes throughout Davis working on my computer when I come to visit.

Favorite Davis Locations: Cafe Roma, Mishkas, Mirai, Griffin Lounge, Peets Coffee, Savvy Shoppe, Pinkadot, Arboretum, The Greenbelt, DoubleDecker Buses, Bogeys Books, Ciocolat, Konditorei, Rainbow City, Ben & Jerrys, Starbucks, Physics and Geology Physics and Geology Building, Sophias Thai Kitchen, 7Eleven, Steves Place Pizza Steves Pizza, African Diaspora House The ADH, Newsbeat, Kathmandu Kitchen,  Icekrimski Cafe
