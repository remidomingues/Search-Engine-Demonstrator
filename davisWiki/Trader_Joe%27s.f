Trader Joes is a mediumsized specialty Supermarkets & Grocery Stores grocery store chain that operates a 12,000squarefoot store in the University Mall parking lot.  It is known for offering http://dotsub.com/view/d8ebbe6cf53b4122b4025e0afeedea41 many kinds of soy milk, for employees wearing Hawaiian shirts and a laidback attitude, for selling items made by other manufacturers at a lower price under the TJs label, for shelves lined with preprepared meals and yummy desserts, for TwoBuck Chuck, and for selling produce with way too much packaging.  TJs had a drawn out and somewhat controversial beginning in Davis; see History below for details.

Reusable Gift Cards Gift cards are available at all Trader Joes Locations and online.

Trader Joes rarely has sales on their products; the company policy is to offer their products at a fair price every day. Products such as meat and produce are sold in prepackaged, preweighed containers.  This is different than most grocery stores where these products are weighed and priced at the register.  Their private label foods do not contain GMOs.  Also, TJs has signed on to the http://www.foe.org/gefreeseafood Friends of the Earth Pledge for GEFree Seafood, which asks grocers to commit to the following: It is our policy to not knowingly purchase or sell GMOs genetically engineered (GE) salmon or other GE seafood, should it come to market.


Trader Joes has an extensive wine selection, including a wide variety of very good wines priced under $5/bottle.

TJs was owned by German billionaire wiki:wikipedia:Theo Albrecht until his death 24 July 2010. He also owned the Aldi Nord grocery store chain in Germany. TJs is now believed to be owned by a trust set up by Albrecht. There are shoppers who still think of the chain as being either small or Californian.
  Trader Joes was founded in California, and later sold to Theo Albrecht. Also, compared to some other supermarkets, Trader Joes can be considered small, but thats all relative.
   The stores are only 10K to 15K square feet, which is cuddly by current standards. But the chain is huge, with 350 stores according to http://www.supermarketnews.com/profiles/top75/trader_joes_market10 this profile. Theyre smaller than WalMart, but what isnt?

One of the reasons people love this specialty grocer is that every day at Trader Joes someone is demoing a usually tasty and strange recipe during business hours. And you can always help yourself to a free coffee sample as well.

Unfortunately, some people have found that mold often appears on the food well before it should, sometimes on the day of purchase. Trader Joes is very good about returns, but its not something a customer should have to deal with consistently.  Other regular customers have not seen any mold.  The difference may have to do with the choice of ones purchases.

 Grand Opening 
Trader Joes did not have a soft open as many stores do.  Instead they held a  Grand Opening http://www.davisenterprise.com/comings_and_goings/?p1114 ceremony on Friday, October 29, 2010 at 8 AM.  Days before the opening, Trader Joes sent postcards to Davis residents that doubled as a coupon for a free reusable bag and a raffle ticket for a chance to win a $50 Trader Joes gift certificate.


 History 

Trader Joes has been greatly desired by Davis residents for some time.  The Measure X campaign tried to entice voters with the possibility of a TJs inside Covell Village, but the measure was rejected by voters.

The city council received the TJs application on June 5, 2006 and it was originally slated to open by the end of 2007, according to an http://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/stories/2006/06/05/daily8.html?from_rss1 article in the Sacramento Business Journal.Footnote(Johnson, Kelly. http://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/stories/2006/06/05/daily8.html?from_rss1 Davis shopping center applies for grocery.   Sacramento Business Journal. 20060605).

When the planning commission made its first recommendations to the Council on September 26, 2006, it was revealed that Radiological Associates of Sacramento (RAS), located on the proposed Trader Joes site, was unwilling to move. RAS moved into the building in 2003 on a 14year lease and had invested $1.6 million in structural improvements.Footnote(St. John, Claire. http://www.davisenterprise.com/articles/2006/09/29/news/094new2.txt Stumbling block for Trader Joe’s. The Davis Enterprise. 20060928.)

On October 17, 2006, the City Council approved zoning changes that would allow Trader Joes to move in. RAS still occupied the lot and despite attempts to convince them to relocate, they showed little interest in doing so. The rezoning would have also allowed RAS to move into the University Mall building, though this would mean another business would have had to leave. Note that the city has no control over these lease negotiations. Teriyaki Express has already been given a 30day eviction notice by UMall owner Centro Watt.Footnote(St. John, Claire. http://www.davisenterprise.com/articles/2006/10/18/news/074new2.txt Council OKs store. The Davis Enterprise. 20061018.) In May 2007, Centro Watt filed suit against RAS over terms of the lease.Footnote(St. John, Claire. http://www.davisenterprise.com/articles/2007/05/18/news/228new1.txt Mall sues RAS to make way for Trader Joe’s. The Davis Enterprise. 20070517.)

On July 27, 2008, the The Peoples Vanguard of Davis http://davisvanguard.blogspot.com/2008/07/traderjoesfinallyiscomingtotown.html reported that RAS was moving to a location on Covell and that a new building for Trader Joes would be constructed at their former U Mall location.

There were speculations that Trader Joes might have been interested in an interior mall space, but the landlords wanted to fill all of the Gottshalks space and wouldnt divide it. Others pointed to Trader Joes observable preference for high visibility and high traffic locations, such as the exterior location they finally leased.

The parking lot location plan was revived in December 2009. Demolition on the site (where Davis Imaging had been located) began in April 2010. Forever 21 eventually moved into the old Gottschalks space.

  Trader Joes/Preopening comments

20101030 12:04:48 nbsp We went in the evening on opening day.  It is so refreshing to be able to pop down the road to TJs and buy just a few things, instead of slogging all the way to Sac and feeling as though we had to stock up for a month.  Each TJs is set up a little differently; I noticed that this one had a lot of prepared food close to the entrance, which I imagine will be a smart move for them.  (The cashier told us that students were mainly stocking up on prepared foods and desserts, and TJs has both in ample supply).  This store has wider aisles than the Sac store, which was really nice since TJs can get crowded, as it was on opening day.  Apparently the lines had been long all day (not surprisingly), but lucky for us they started to die down while we were there.  The parking lot was a bit crazy, though, which seems par for the course for TJs.

The first days sample was meatballs and BBQ sauce; I was a little surprised that they didnt pick something vegetarian that would appeal to more people, but then again, they were pretty tasty.  And they hadnt run out of the free bags by the time we checked out, which was also nice.  All in all, Im really psyched that TJs is (finally) in Davis. Users/CovertProfessor

20101031 11:29:31 nbsp First, off Im a BIG fan of TJs.  We went to TJs midday Saturday, October 30th in our small car.  What a mistake.  The newly striped parking spaces are barely wide enough for a compact and then you cant even open your doors if youre adjacent to another vehicle.  Did the City of Davis sign off on these nonconforming spaces?  Theyre doublestriped unlike any other spaces Ive ever seen  anywhere.  Other than the hassle of trying to get in or out of our vehicle and reversing out (which was nearly impossible due to limited distance between bumpers), the store was crazybusy with happy customers, a busy crew and long lines.

Kudos to all who contributed (they are many, indeed) to get a great TJs here except to the Parking Lot Crew that will have to revisit how the stalls were measured and painted.  Id do it for free since Ive always wanted to design the perfect parking lot for a hightraffic store.  I like arrows and slanted spaces personally.  My recommendation:  walk, ride, take a bus or fly until the parking lot is restriped properly.  Or park as far AWAY from TJs as practical because its not worth the frustration.  Or the dented doors and bumpers.  Sorry for the rant....Go TJs!!!  Luv ya already...welcome to Davis.  Grins to all. Users/fknochenhauer

20101101 08:44:43 nbsp I love love love TJs and am so excited for its long awaited arrival.  However, the parking lot is ridiculous.  Like fknochenhauer, we have a tiny car.  The parking spaces are far too narrow!  We could barely open our doors and then had to squeeze ourselves out.  Until the lot gets restriped, I will only ride my bike.  Good for my health and the environment, but super inconvenient!  TJs:  please restripe your lot! Users/WMD

20101101 13:36:54 nbsp I have to agree about the parking spaces! I was tempted to park and take two spots, but thought better of it and kept circling until I was able to find a slanted spot and put my baby to sleep. Users/jsbmeb

20101101 18:39:45 nbsp Hmph. I had no problem parking my 02 Camry. Strange that others seem to be having such issues. Maybe I was parking in a different set of spaces...?

Anyway, nice to have a TJs here. I wonder what this will do to the CoOp, though, given the overlap in many of their specialty food items and the fact that TJs is cheaper. (Economies of scale, I would imagine.) Users/RobertM525

20101103 21:53:08 nbsp Nice to have but I was unable to find many of my perennial TJs favorites from when I lived in Sacramento. No Aronia Berry juice, Nasi Goreng or Acai of any kind. Not worth going there regularly because lets face it most of what they sell is junkfood once you weed out the healthy staples. Glad they have arrived in Davis though Whole Foods is really what Im waiting for. Users/MaryCarroll

20101104 14:29:07 nbsp from the Peoples Vanguard of Davis site, Dec. 2008:
Community Development Director Katherine Hess told the Vanguard that there is no financial arrangement with Trader Joes. However, she later clarified that point understanding that the incentives that DANG refers to in their letter are a reduction in parking requirements. She suggested that the city would be open to doing the same at Westlake if that would make a difference.

However, this misses the point. According to the traffic and parking analysis, the building of Trader Joes would require a larger number of parking spaces at the University Mall in order to accommodate the increased amount of customers using the facility. However, the expansion of the facility to accommodate Trader Joes will actually result in a reduced number of parking spaces available. The city is not requiring Trader Joes or the University Mall to provide for those additional spaces. Instead they are arguing that the parking lot is under utilized at it stands now and that they would simply increase the enforcement against people using the lot who live in adjacent apartment buildings.

So, I guess the parking lot was considered too small and the Parking Lot Crew decided to paint really narrow spaces and wedge in as many as they could.  Ride a bike, walk, etc. until this is fixed.  I hope they put arrows in and angle parking streetside on Sycamore.  That would make sense. Users/fknochenhauer

20101106 21:37:35 nbsp I lived relatively near a Trader Joes growing up, however, my family only went a few times and it was at an age before I started cooking for myself. Having heard positive things about it from my friends, I went in excited about a week ago. I guess I was expecting more of a specialty market, but instead it seemed very costcolike (without the quantity, and increase in quality), everything was prepackaged for efficiency. I have nothing bad to say about the service, however, part of cooking for me is choosing my own produce (and the quantity) or go to a the butcher counter and pick out a piece of meat. I will probably come here for parties if Im just going to lay out some cheeses or premade food, otherwise Ill probably stick to more traditional grocery stores.  Users/AlvinTsao

20101115 16:39:17 nbsp I like Trader Joes Citrus Body Wash. Regular bar soap dries my skin, while Trader Joes body wash moisturizes my skin. I will never go back to bar soap again. Users/MaxLucas

20101124 16:17:14 nbsp Unlike the previous comments I am a newbie to the chain. Love Love Love Trader Joes! I am so happy it is here and in my neighborhood. Not only great products, but excellent prices as well. It seems it will not be a good thing for the other grocers though.  Users/Sherri

20101128 07:57:09 nbsp The Trader Joes parking lot in Davis is vastly bigger than most, including the next closest in Sacramento, where there is usually a long wait for a parking spot of any kind.  In Seattle, the TJs parking lots (especially on Capitol Hill and Queen Anne Hill) are famous for causing minor damage and major frustration.  I still recommend biking to avoid the parking mess, but I certainly wouldnt hold my breath for restriping.    Users/aubitz

20101129 20:05:38 nbsp A welcomed addition to Davis. Typical Trader Joe offerings: cheapish items, good variety of organic and healthy foods. As others have noted, the parking lot is very cramped. If you have a longer/bigger car and park in the more narrow spaces (to the side of Umall), you will face difficulties. Bike if you can. Otherwise, try to snag a parking space in the more central parking lot (i.e. in front of World Market). Users/blastoff

20110119 12:42:09 nbsp Best coffee selection in town Users/mangosalsa
  the Kenyan coffee doesnt even taste Kenyan. Could be any south American noname beans.

20110206 13:09:44 nbsp All my white friends hype up TJs to the max. Its good but not that good. The employees seem to be really into buying a lot of their stuff. Do they get a discount or something like that? Anyways...

Pros: Good for a quick delicious frozen meal. Good for CHEAP wine.

Cons: Not a good selection of vegies to cook with. Not the cheapest place in the world. Random selection it seems. I wanted to buy tinfoil which they dont have, but if I wanted catnip or dog toys they do. Users/David.Tran
     Ive heard that all employees get a 10% discount.  Users/ScottMeehleib

20110216 11:49:48 nbsp Im in love with Trader Joes. My first experience shopping at a Trader Joes was the on in Davis. They offer a nice selection of foods and products and the prices are great. I think that they should add more items though, it seems like a very small store. I will continue to shop here because its affordable. you really get your moneys worth. Users/Sandlot3

20110413 20:08:06 nbsp I wont be shopping there anymore. I wanted to try a new recipe for shrimp where you cook them in white wine, so I went there to get the ingredients. I am 35 years old and was denied service. Then I went to the coop and got my groceries and it is indeed an excellent recipe :)
I regret having taken my shopping from the coop to trader joes for a while. Users/MichaelNielsen
 Denied service? How? Users/TomGarberson
  I do not know how to post a comment as a reply so I do it as an edit: @Tom: The staff only knows how to read CA IDs, so they did not know if my Danish ID was fake or not. Ive been around Davis on and off since 2004 and never had a problem like this. But it is fine, I like the coop much better, anyway, I was getting tired of all the plastic.

20110512 06:36:49 nbsp @michaelnielsen, it is not the employees fault for not accepting your Danish ID. California alcohol law states that if you dont look 45 years old, they must card you and if you are even 60 and are asked for ID you have to provide one or they can still turn you away from an alcohol purchase...if I am wrong please correct me. As for not accepting your Danish ID, it is a Trader Joes company policy to not accept any IDs as valid unless there is a photo and physical identification such as height, weight, eye and hair color, and so on...and of course needs to be in English. Users/xeks
 So, the other establishments could have been busted by big brother?  (Got to back up Danish bro.) Users/BruceHansen bh

   Still, theres no way looking at me, you can get the impression Im not old enough, and then I also have the documents that tell its true  no way you can believe that is fake, unless you are a moron, even if its not your standard looking document. With Davis being such an international area and the DMW being under budgeted and overworked so people barely can get their license before leaving again, common sense should be applied. Its safe to assume that having a brat who probably isnt old enough himself keeping someone old enough to be his father to cook the planned dinner will spawn a reaction. Not to mention how hypocritical it is to have those laws to begin with in a place thats supposed to be the liberal beacon land of the free and minimal government intervention, and turning being frauded into being the crime. So should the store that sells a knife to the murderer be punished? or should food be restricted because if you use it wrong, you get fat and die?

    Usually passports are accepted for international customers as proof of age. While its not illegal to deny service to international customers because they dont have a U.S. ID, it is in general viewed as a rather trashy business practice. If MN indeed had a Danish passport, that should have been accepted as proof of age (since a passport does have a photo, birth date, height and weight). Not sure if a Danish ID is the same as a passport, and I am not sure the difference matters. Users/MattHh

20110811 12:54:14 nbsp Quick Express Checkout Line (15 items or less).  I asked management to consider a line for those of us who only buy a few things and have to trudge along in a long line.  Other TJs have them and I hope Davis will add one soon when customer flow warrants it.  Suggestion:  ask the people behind the raised counter WHEN they will be including a Quick Checkout line.  That would help my customer experience at this store.  Luv it, but would luv it more if I could hitandrun when in a rush. Users/fknochenhauer

20110907 12:36:00 nbsp Great experience with TJs today. I called because a loaf of bread I had just bought had already molded before I had even opened it and I was hoping to get a fresh loaf. Not only did my phone call go straight to a real person (not an automated press suchandsuchbutton) service, but the person who answered was able to help me and was EXTREMELY friendly and understanding. Not only did he tell me hed been through before the same problem, but told me the best way to make it last the longest and offered me a new loaf or my money back for the loaf that went bad. One of the best customer service experiences Ive had in a long time! Users/AmyMartin

20110911 19:13:12 nbsp Trader Joes is awesome! So much better than Nugget (stuck up front end and really bad chinese/sushi).  The people are so nice, the quality of food is amazing and the prices are low. Users/rosepetal140
  Ive never experienced any stuck up attitudes at Nugget. Id say TJs and Nugget are equals in terms of customer service. Users/jsogul
  I, too, have never had a bad experience with the Nugget employees. Theyre always so friendly and happy, and I love going to both places. Users/TheShah
   Also, the Masala Burgers at TJs are delicious. Users/TheShah SS

20111223 20:32:22 nbsp Dose any one know if they sell Dr. Bronners magic Soap here? Ive been told the Davis food Coop carries it, but they charge you more if you arent a member. Im just trying to figure out if it is worth buying it online and paying to have a gallon of liquid shipped to me.  Users/SmellyGroundHog
  I may have seen it at Trader Joes and in case it is there is most likely less expensive.  If it were a bulk item at the Coop it would be less expensive.  It may have been a bulk item at one time.  As an example of bulk savings at the Coop, cinnamon like other spices is packaged at Trader Joes for $1.99.  1 1/2 oz. is $1.99 vs bulk at the Coop for ~$8/ lb..  Heres an unrelated example of savings for a giantquantity 55 gallon drum of a http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005MR3IVO/refas_li_ss_tl?ieUTF8&taguhpi20&linkCodeas2&camp1789&creative390957&creativeASINB005MR3IVO product that can be used before using Dr. Bronners soap. Users/BruceHansen
      Definitely have bought Dr. Bronners at the Coop as well as Nugget, didnt even think to check TJs for it. Users/sba
       Trader Joes carries 32 oz. bottles for $9.99.  Also, regarding spices, the same size 2 1/2 oz. bottles of spices are 99 cents at the Grocery Outlet.  Their curry powder is more flavorful and less hot than Trader Joes  better to me. Users/BruceHansen

20121026 19:46:44 nbsp I think Im done with Trader Joes.  They sell a lot of cool stuff, but it just doesnt last.  After my last shopping trip there the bread was moldy after 2 days (the ENTIRE loaf), the bagels were moldy after 4 days (all three remaining in the pack), and the pack of chicken wings (sealed and refrigerated, obviously) smelled horrible when opened after 4 days.

Not sure if theyre selling old food or arent storing it properly, but I dont feel like throwing away $10 per shopping trip on food thats probably already going bad when I walk out of the store with it.  Not worth it. Users/TomGarberson

  The fact that it had massive mold growth after only 2 days means that there is severe mold contamination at the place where it is baked. This is very disturbing in that mold can be potentially fatal to people who are allergic to it. The absolutely unsanitary conditions under which the bread is baked must mean that the facilities have massive mold growths all over the ceilings and walls. Remember the mold contaminated lab that produced the steroid injections that killed 25 people. Think of the horrifying images of black killer mold all over the ceilings and walls with tons of mold spores falling all over the loaves of bread. Several years ago I bought fresh baked bread from a Safeway in another city and after only a few days it was infested with mold. I suffered an allergic reaction of the type that almost killed me. Mold has deep roots and by the time you see it on the surface it is already deeply present internally inside the bread in massive amounts. This isnt a case of selling old food. This is a case of massive mold infestations at Trader Joes bakeries and/or food storage facilities. These facilities need to be raided and inspected ASAP. Users/MaxLucas
   I dont personally know anything about mold, but I know its not a Davisspecific issue, because Ive had the same problems at the Sacramento location. I used to tolerate it because I assumed it was because their products arent chock full of preservatives. But having read Maxs comment, it seems more disturbing now.  Users/ScottMeehleib
   For what its worth, I buy bread here on a regular basis and have not had any mold.  Perhaps I am just buying different bread.  In fact, the bread weve bought hangs out in the refrigerator for quite a long time before it molds. Its also worth noting that, in general, the products labelled as Trader Joes (or some variant) are not actually made by TJs, but by someone else with whom TJs has an arrangement.  I say this not to excuse them for selling a moldy product, but just to point out that TJs food comes from many, many sources.  Users/CovertProfessor
   I too have had this problem with certain produce products and when I called the manager he told me to come by with my receipt and he would refund or replace the item depending on what I wanted. Users/Zeeba

20121027 23:29:16 nbsp So they have a sign at this location about patrons deserving to shop in an environment free of solicitations and yet this one fundraising group insists upon ACCOSTING me whenever I visit.  I pointed out the sign to them and they were rude and dismissive stating they couldnt legally be removed and almost seemed to enjoy flaunting it in front of a sign that implies they are not wanted.  I have no desire to donate to them and almost want to picket people not to.   Users/OliviaY

20130118 13:41:07 nbsp I love Trader Joes! I lived practically across the street from the store right up to opening day, then moved to the other side of Davis :( That is why it is so disappointing that the parking spots are so small  its a 30 minute bike ride to the store and I am no longer a student so I dont bike that direction much anymore, and I have found myself pulling into the parking lot only to get frustrated and end up going to SaveMart. I cant and wont deal with the parking lot. Also  WHO in Gods name is the woman with the insane witch cackle laugh?! The parking lot and the employee with that obnoxious LAUGH (The first couple times I heard it I thought it was fake; nope, very WTF real) are enough to make me cringe so much that I just stopped going to TJs. And my kitchen is sad because of it.  Users/mooodavis
