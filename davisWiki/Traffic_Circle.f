The Peoples Republic of Davis and UC Davis the University, in an attempt to become even more European, have installed a few traffic circles in various locations.  Despite the presence of many bike circles on campus, the idea of traffic circles was initially met with limited enthusiasm, presumably because so many students have memories of horrible bicycle accidents and rightofway mishaps on the first day of school.  In practice, the circles have worked out fairly well, largely owing to the fact that they are all one lane wide (unlike in Europe, where they are sometimes two or three lanes wide  imagine American drivers trying to figure those out).  If you have trouble, just remember that the traffic in the circle has the rightofway.

Proponents of the circles note that they eliminate the need to stop at intersections with no crosstraffic.

Traffic circles are becoming more common in the U.S. as the practice of  http://www.trafficcalming.org/ Traffic Calming becomes more prevalent. The ones in Davis are http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundabout#Difference_between_roundabouts_and_traffic_circles more technically called roundabouts. Interestingly, a thorough linguistic survey suggests trafficcircle to be the http://cfprod01.imt.uwm.edu/Dept/FLL/linguistics/dialect/staticmaps/q_84.html preferred term in North America, with Californians being http://cfprod01.imt.uwm.edu/Dept/FLL/linguistics/dialect/staticmaps/state_CA.html split down the middle in their usage, except in Northern California, where the term roundabout seems more prevalent. It is unclear whether this is due to linguistic preference, or to accuracy in naming.  The term rotary is the preferred term in much of New England.  In Southern California (home of the the prefix on highway names), the traffic circle is frequently known by the Spanish name of glorieta.  Less commonly used names include euroloops and car cyclotrons.


To celebrate/mock the installation of the traffic circle at the intersection of Anderson Road @ Alvarado Avenue, someone taped together a bunch of cardboard boxes in the shape of a clock tower.

Traffic circles currently exist at:
  Anderson Road and Alvarado Avenue in North Davis
  Fifth Street and Cantrill Dr. by the Davis Police Department
  Shasta Drive and Olympic Dr. next to Arroyo Park
  Moore Blvd. and Rockwell Dr. in Northeast Davis
  Moore Blvd. and Wright Blvd. also in Northeast Davis

On Campus:
  Hutchison Drive in West Campus as part of the new West Village development. Several more are planned for the surface streets of the development.
  Bike Circle Bike Circles
  Old Davis Road and California Avenue
