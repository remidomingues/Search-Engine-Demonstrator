In order to make driving in Davis easier for you it will be helpful to know about the local traffic patterns. Or avoid the whole thing by Telecommute telecommuting. The City of Davis also has a program called Street Smarts that provides information on using transportation in town.

 Bicycle 
 on the UCD campus 

Busy times include 9AM and lunchtime.  Watch where youre going, and look out for people who arent paying attention!  Pedestrians should be courteous and walk on sidewalks rather than in the bike lanes.  If youre forced to walk in a bike lane, please try to keep to the rightmost side.  Such common courtesy is especially important when there are a lot of folks on the move.

The numerous seemingly untimed stoplights on 5th Street, which turns into Russell Boulevard on the West side of town, contributes to what is probably the worst street traffic in Davis during commute hours.  If youre trying to get across town during 8AM9PM and/or 5PM6PM, you might be better off using Covell Boulevard or Interstate 80 instead.
