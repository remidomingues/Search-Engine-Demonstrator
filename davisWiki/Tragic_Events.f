 July 30, 2011: Terry Tanner 

A 71yearold Davis man lost his life Sunday night after being struck by two vehicles while biking on County Road 99 north of Covell Boulevard, according to the California Highway Patrol. Terry Tanner was riding in the middle of the southbound traffic lane at about 9:45 p.m. when he was hit from behind by an Acura Integra, whose driver, 40yearold Ibrahim Almajali of Woodland, told officers he had not seen the bicyclist in front of him, CHP Officer Cindy Leal said.

The 55 m.p.h. impact caused Tanner to strike the windshield and roof of the Acura, then land in the southbound traffic lane, Leal said. Almajali stopped his vehicle after the collision and ran back to the scene.  About a minute later, another vehicle approached the scene at 55 m.p.h. and, despite Almajali’s efforts to wave down the driver, also struck Tanner, according to Leal.  Tanner was pronounced dead at the scene of multiple bluntforce injuries. His death has been ruled accidental, Yolo County Chief Deputy Coroner Robert LaBrash said today.

20131109 17:27:10 nbsp Andrea Laurette Mrotzs death is still being investigated but suspiciously. There are video cameras the Amtrak Depot and both the Yolo County Coroner, Amtrak Police and Union Pacific Police are saying no such camera footage exits. If anyone has any information regarding the events leading up to Andreas death please contact her family at luckyarjj@yahoo.com.   Andrea died a horrible death.  If anyone has any knowledge by person experience of the cameras at the Davis Train Depot, please come forward.  Users/albertajones

20131109 21:24:57 nbsp Dear Alberta Jones. I was the one bringing this to Davis Wiki because I saw it on the ABC News (News 10 At Nine), and I am still very sad to hear about this tragic event. On the news they said, Andrea was on the phone with somebody. Is that true? and if it is, that person on the phone should be able to tell something? I can relate to this tragic event because I also experienced something tragic with a train in Netherlands while being on that train. I wont elaborate on that, but I can feel your loss.
