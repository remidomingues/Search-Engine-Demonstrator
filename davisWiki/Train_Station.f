The Train Station is also known as the Amtrak Station.  It is officially called the Southern Pacific (or SP) Depot, the name of the original Davis train station. The original station was built in 1868 and stood where Our House is today.  The current station was constructed in 1913 and is a historic landmark.    Currently operated by Amtrak, it uses the Union Pacific Railroad.  The station is located downtown at Address(840 2nd Street), next to that fork monument thing called Solar Intersections.  It is also home to a piece of town art descriptively known as the Straw Bale Bench  go have a sit. The surrounding landscape and renovations were designed by INDIGO/Hammond & Playle Architects, LLP Indigo Architects and a philosophy statement and early photos are featured on their http://www.indigoarch.com/projects/amtrak.html web page. It also features the Davis Tower, which is, fittingly, only two stories tall, and the A.G. Brinley Plaza, named for a former station agent. The station, parking lot and tower are in the middle of the Davis wye of Train Tracks train tracks connecting to the north, but the segment on the downtown side of the station is mostly unused by trains.

Official information on the station can be found on the http://www.greatamericanstations.com/Stations/DAV/Station_view Great American Stations website, and on the http://www.amtrakcalifornia.com/index.cfm/stations/bus/davis/ Amtrak California website.

The train station is a good place for railfanning rail fans to hang out.

In Dec 2007, plans were in place to add about 30 parking spaces to the area.  This will result in the loss of some attractive landscaping.  Plans are also in place to add some bicycle parkingon a recent weekend there were 260 bikes parked at the station and only 150 official bike racks.

20110731 14:58:53 nbsp The city council better not make Davis a quiet zone. First, there are often people who carelessly walk near the railroad tracks when the train is 200 feet away, and need to be honked at in order to move. Secondly, railfans like me would like to be able to enjoy our hobby. It is not the same if we dont get to hear the train horns blowing at all.

Train horns sound so much better than loud music played by party animals. If any of them beg for a quiet zone, I would only blow the horn louder, lol! Users/Chelsea744
  I agree.  I adapted to the train sounds within a few months of moving to Davis.  Now I hardly notice them at all; when I do, I find them charming and oddly soothing.  Well worth the increase in safety.   Users/CovertProfessor
