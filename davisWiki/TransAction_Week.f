Trans Action Week is held annually in late November as a time of education and awareness around transgender and gender variant issues and experiences.  It is organized by the TransAction Committee, under the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Resource Center. Events vary greatly, from speakers to self defense training, draw your gender, Trans 101 and academic discussions of community intersections (to name just a few).

The 2010 Trans Action Week was from November 15th to 19th. The schedule was as follows:

Monday, November 15th

HIV Testing  Free & Anonymous

The test is “rapid”, which means that results only take 20 minutes, and is an oral swab (no blood needed!). The LGBT Resource Center is located on campus at the University House Annex across from Voorhies Hall. Walkins are welcome during testing hours. Please come in early to signup for a time slot.

Categorical Difficulties: Trans Subjects and the Politics of Legibility
This academic panel of papers will trace the epistemic violence faced by gender nonconforming people, arising from the narrowlydefined gender categories available to officially identify and classify trans folks. In order to be legible within legal and social systems, gender nonconforming people are forced to narrate themselves through reductive, binary categories. This often comes at the expense of having the ability to define and imagine different ways of organizing gendered or nongendered identities, histories, and bodies. As a result, for those who fall under the umbrella term transgender, the gaining of political recognition, civil rights, and access to community benefits often comes at the expense of their own ability to define themselves. This panel will investigate these contradictions and offer strategies for navigating the politics of transgender categorization in more complex and socially responsible ways.

TransForming Body Image
Traditionally, body image has been discussed in a way that is gender dichotomous and not inclusive of varying expressions of identity.  This workshop will explore messages about appearance and gender and how they impact body image and self esteem.  Presenters from Counseling And Psychological Services (CAPS) will help participants feel empowered to explore body image in a healthy way that allows for integration of intersecting identities.  This workshop assumes a preexisting level of familiarity with basic issues around gender identity.
