Transfer students at UC Davis often come from their local Community Colleges community colleges, while some do transfer from other fouryear institutions.   Most come from community colleges, since they tend to be easier to transfer from than other fouryear schools.  However, some students started out initially at a four year school straight out of high school, but for whatever reason, decided not to continue at their initial school and went to community college to enter UCD as a transfer.

The number of students transferring from community colleges has increased over the years. Taking lower division courses at a community college can save thousands of dollars over taking the same courses at a University of California campus. This can help many students to avoid a high debt load after graduating from college.

The university lumps transfer students together with reentry students.  More information can be had from the Transfer Student Services part of the Student Special Services center in the South Hall on the UC Davis Campus campus.

On the positive side, transfer students of junior standing are given the highest priority when applying for admission to UC Davis if they are transferring from a California Community College.  They also get their own UC Davis Orientation program, which for 2009 begins midJune.

Often transfer students, especially those from out of the area, are just as mystified and lonely as Out of State Students out of state students.  To help, we have a Transfer Student Guide to help transfers assimilate themselves into Davis life.

Being a transfer student is kinda like being a Freshmen freshman, except youre generally the only one in your classes thats so clueless about campus and town.  Users/JevanGray
  20050920 nbsp You are sort of right. Another thing is that many transfer students are a little older, so we feel really out of the group. Hey man we dont really want to talk about how much the world hates one or the other. We are just ready to challenge life. We had to travel a long road to be where we are, for we didnt have the same resources young kids might had.  Users/CristinaPerdomo

20061027 15:58:50 nbsp But we have the comfort of knowing we didnt have to share a year with people they hated in the dorms :) And we (IGETCers) dont have to worry about all those pesky GEs during senior year! Users/LizCerv

20090507 11:38:03 nbsp I thought this was funny because this is exactly where I am right now: However, some students started out initially at a four year school straight out of high school, but for whatever reason, decided not to continue at their initial school and went to community college to enter UCD as a transfer.
