Transition Davis is a group of Transition Town advocates in Davis that collaborate on a number of projects in Davis that will increase the resilience of residents in a changing climate, peak oil, and drought.  Members include folks from Davis Dollars, the Davis Permaculture Guild, Bee Love School of Permaculture, and other environmentally conscious groups in town. In 2014, they initiated a Grass 2 Garden Grass 2 Garden effort, in which they help consult, organize, and install food gardens in peoples front lawns across town.
