Probably one of the most unique things about  Navigating Davis navigating Davis is its transportation network. Legions of bikes and a fleet of doubledecker buses are its signature features.


 Getting Around Town 

On campus, Transportation And Parking Services TAPS regulates both bicycle and motor vehicles. It is best to follow a simple rule: the shortest distance between any two points in Davis isnt a straight line  its a bike.

 Bike 
Davis is wellknown for its fleet of bicycles and corresponding infrastructure. Everywhere in Davis is accessible by a bike lane or Bike Paths path, including several Bike tunnels tunnels and Bike Overpasses bridges that span under/over roadways. Various intersections, the most prominent being Russell and Sycamore Lane Sycamore, even sport a green/red light specifically for bicycles. The bike system culminates at campus which is closed to general auto traffic. Bicycle circles and lanes dominate the campus streets which become flooded with pedaling traffic between classes. Visitors are usually amazed at the sheer number and volume of bikes. See Bicycling for further information.

 Bus 

 Unitrans 
Another novel aspect of Davis transportation is the bus system, Unitrans, which runs several Londonesque doubledecker buses as well as a fleet of singledeck buses that operate on natural gas engines.  This system spans the majority of Davis and lines originate from the http://www.cevs.ucdavis.edu/map/map_detail.cfm?assetInfo87 Memorial Union and the http://www.cevs.ucdavis.edu/map/map_detail.cfm?deptInfo284 Silo on campus.

 Yolobus

 Disabled, Transportation for the 
Davis Community Transit is a paratransit bus that serves residents of Davis who have a qualifying disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), as well as general public (when time and space permit). Davis Community Transit is a curbtocurb (theyll pick you up and drop you off) transportation service provided by the City of Davis. You must register with Davis Community Transit in order to use this service.  Reservations are required and fares are $2.00 for each oneway trip. Davis Community Transit serves Davis only.

 Motor Vehicle 
If you are driving a motor vehicle, you get to deal with parking. It is best to park someplace and then walk. Even better, if you have a bicycle, it would be easier to use it to get around the downtown and campus area than having to find a parking space and/or having to pay to park. Be careful of time limitations. Some people discover that they can go Carfree in Davis.

The coolest motor vehicle in Davis has to be RoboChair but unfortunately it is not street legal, however one of these days we hope to get it capable to go 25mph, yes that would be an armchair going by at 25mph!

 Motorcycles and Scooters 
Finding parking for a motorcycle may be easier, given its size; however, the city does not have the best record for safety concerning motorcyclists. The California Office of Traffic Safety compares the accident statistics of cities with similar populations, giving those with the poorest records the worst rankings, with 1st place being the worst. That year, Davis ranked 17th out of 104 cities for motorcycle safety.

Statewide, the incidence of fatal and personal injury accidents involving motorcyclists is decreasing. In 2009, 394 riders were killed in crashes, a decline of 29.6 percent from 2008, when there were 560 fatalities. 2009 marked the first decrease in fatal accidents that occurred in California since 1998. Motorcyclists account for a disproportionate rate of collisions and are 28 times more likely to die in a crash than the occupants of other vehicles, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Although riders in their teens and twenties represent only a small percentage of motorcycle owners, they account for nearly twice the percentage of fatalities suffered each year.

Students considering using a motorcycle to get around should first take a training course. The California Highway Patrol offers such courses through its California Motorcyclist Safety Program (CMSP) http://www.chp.ca.gov/programs/motorcycle.html.
