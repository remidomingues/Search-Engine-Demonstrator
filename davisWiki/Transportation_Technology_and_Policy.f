TTP is a graduate group at UC Davis offering both a M.S. and a Ph.D. There are two areas of specialization: Transportation Technology and Transportation Planning and Policy. While transportation is generally a branch of Civil Engineering, TTP provides a broader, more interdisciplinary program (although civil engineers are more than welcome!). Students studying transportation may find themselves involved with the Institute of Transportation Studies.
