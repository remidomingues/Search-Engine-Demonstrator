Travel Agencies in Davis are few, but typically very good in terms of getting you a good deal. Students and university affiliates should always call or visit STA Travel on campus, because they often work a bit harder to get you a better price and offer additional educational discounts on rail passes, travel insurance, international phone & internet access and accommodations.

Along with travel, you might want to stock up on Travelers Checks. USE Credit Union offers free Travelers Checks & cashiers checks with their free checking account.
