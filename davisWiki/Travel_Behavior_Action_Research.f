The Travel Behavior Action Research Team is an interdisciplinary group of graduate students working to understand and improve transportation at UC Davis.

In 2007, this studentdirected seminar, focused on studying travel to and from campus and how to move towards a sustainable campus transportation system, provided a handson introduction to social science research. Students are working to develop research questions, write proposals, perform focus groups, complete the human subjects approval form for their research, and create online surveys related to campus travel. Students are also helping to perform the annual travel assessment being performed in parallel by the instructor, which may entail attending campus committee meetings and communicating with UCD staff. Analysis of the survey results will be conducted in a 1 unit course during the winter quarter. This studentinitiated project is part of a joint collaboration between the Institute of Transportation Studies (ITS), Transportation Parking Services (TAPS), and the Office of Resource Management and Planning (ORMP) at UC Davis.
