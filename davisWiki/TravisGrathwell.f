The lack of uptake to wiki:sf SFWiki makes me make this a face like this :(


20060710 21:11:40 nbsp Re: Wiki Update notice on front page:  Doh  I was waiting until the 17th so the notice was up two months.  But yeah, its been bugging me as well. Users/JabberWokky

20060807 19:20:36 nbsp Thanks  and now I know how to chop down those Aggie URLs.  I tried removing the GET vars, but it didnt work. Users/JabberWokky

20060819 19:31:30 nbsp I was merely giving structure to the pageand make it less onesidedwhen I added the Get over yourself.  JoshFernandez wrote his pro opinion and I merely transcribed it to the proturtle section that I appropriately created.  Yes, I chose one of many pro comments, but its not my duty to transcribe every single proturtle entry.  Instead of reverting to the version that existed prior to my edits, you could have easily transcribed the pro comments for the community yourself. Users/RishiTrivedi

20060819 22:33:55 nbsp thanks for helping to make the discussion civil. im tired. Users/MorganFlores

20060921 13:50:11 nbsp I wish my greatest sins were as slight as not updating a wiki page (and adorably misplaced facial hair). Why do you look so sad in the second picture?  Users/KaiTing
  Whatever, KaiTing.  You got served. Users/RishiTrivedi

Sorry, I created the Gulag page as it was a funny mention on a few pages, but honestly it is a dead thing and people should stop reviving a joke which has expired. ~Users/DavePoole
