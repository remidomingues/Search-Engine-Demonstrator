Hi!  I work at your friendly neighborhood comic book shop/movie store, Bizarro World and Four Star Movies.

Im an independent author of roleplaying games, with my first game being released April 9th.  It will be available online and at Bizarro World.

20110503 14:50:41 nbsp Mea culpa!  Welcome to the wiki! Users/CovertProfessor

20110503 17:56:51 nbsp Then I fail at reading change logs!  Thanks for the welcome. ;) Users/TravisLindquist

20110503 18:17:57 nbsp Not sure how it was abrasive. Riki is basically a celebrity amongst Magic players. Users/hankim

20110503 19:26:12 nbsp Hey Travis  a belated Welcome to the Wiki!  I reverted the Bizarro World page because it lost information that taught me something.  The way it was phrased, despite being a little abrasive, got me to go look Riki up.  Without it, I wouldnt have realized that a local is one of the most famous Magic folks out there Users/TomGarberson

20110504 15:34:36 nbsp How is it off for a business description? I just described that they sold to a judge with near celebrity status. Users/hankim

20110504 16:14:17 nbsp Hey, I started a Talk page over at {{{Bizarro World/Talk}}} so we can have opinions consolidated in one place, and laid out why I think the information thats removed when taking out the snarky language is important.  Feel free to chime in there. Users/TomGarberson
