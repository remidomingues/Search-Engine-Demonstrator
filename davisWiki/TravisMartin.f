20110426 23:07:46 nbsp I understand your concern about the reputation of your company, I really do but the wiki is NOT a vanguard for Davis Businesses.  True I dont depend on the wiki for my livelihood but I have a lot of time, and several other editors have probably years when you add up how much time they spent on this wiki, so there is an investment in the outcome of this.

As Ive said before, it wasnt the accusation that made me stop using your company (which I have used at least five times in the past that I can think of top of my head) but the subsequent treatment of the wiki.  You might want to consider how this negatively reflects upon village cab too.  I found Davids initial response to be a fair way of treating the issue, at least for 6 months, before it brought up again and had I been reading the wiki for the first time it would not have deterred me from calling Village Cab.  This nonsense would and has.

Id also like to point out that this coincided with 24/7s entry into town.  I see them EVERYWHERE at night so it might be that you are misplacing some/all the blame for a slow down in business. Users/OliviaY
    This site is basically trash left over from 1998 and Travis has a right to be angry...you do realize that though total illegality and disregard that guy has stolen from all of the honorable drivers in this town? Dont ride with Village, that is your right...but if you want a company that has the best drivers, cars with working seat belts, working brakes, drivers that arent drug dealers, thieves or prostitutes.....you might want to reconsider your anitVillage cab policy.
