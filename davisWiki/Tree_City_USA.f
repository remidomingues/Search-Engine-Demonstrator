Davis has been designated as a Tree City USA by the http://www.arborday.org National Arbor Day Foundation.  The Arbor Day Foundation sponsors this designation in cooperation with the http://www.fs.fed.us/ USDA Forest Service and the http://www.stateforesters.org/ National Association of State Foresters.  The purpose of this program is to provide direction, technical assistance, public attention, and national recognition for urban and community forestry programs.

Davis has held this designation for 34 years, only surpassed in California by Burbank and Sacramento (each 35 years).  Surprisingly, our neighboring city of Woodland has only held the designation for 12 years. To see examples of why Davis has been a Tree City USA for so long, see the page on our Street Trees.

On Arbor Day, which is usually celebrated in California the week of wiki:wikipedia:Luther Burbank Luther Burbanks birthday (7 March), but which may be and frequently is celebrated later, in April, there is a celebration at the Davis Farmers Market, at which a Tree City USA banner is presented to the city.

With the http://davis.patch.com/articles/treecrewlaidoffdayafterparktaxpassedlettertotheeditor elimination of the citys only tree crew by city manager Steve Pinkerton, and the http://www.davisenterprise.com/localnews/city/citytrimsnineemployeesfromparkspublicworks/ promises of further reductions in staffing, its possible that the city may no longer meet http://www.arborday.org/programs/treeCityUSA/standards.cfm the criteria for inclusion in the Tree City USA program. Davis can then join the elite ranks of Former Tree Cities USA, with other notables such as Duluth, MN and Allentown, PA.

So wait a minute... I have a buddy of mine who used to work in the Tree division. West Coast arborists or whomever is going to get the replacement contract isnt going to care about the work, and its going to do a good job (they will actually do the complete opposite). It already took me 3 months to harass the city to come out and cut a tree that was dangerously splitting over a driveway and a major street near where I reside. The trees need to have attention paid to them. We have been trying to get our tree out front trimmed since last summer and they trimmed all the non dangerous branches and left all the mistletoe so now its basically assured to collapse onto the cars Daubert
