The Town Flora tree climbing population of Davis mostly consists of stranded rock climbers, bored students, drunk drunks, and children. Though Davis may not have much in terms of rock formations to Climbing climb, it makes up for it by providing a plethora of opportunities for Buildering buildering and tree climbing. There is even a group on Facebook and an http://www.treeclimbing.com/ international society dedicated to the activity.

Be warned, tree climbing is dangerous, and can tear up your forearms pretty badly with some nasty cuts. So be sure to consider this before taking part in the glorious sport of tree climbing.
