Tree Davis is a nonprofit organization, the mission of which is to enhance the Davis urban forest while educating area residents, businesses, 16 schools, and other organizations on the value of trees in our community.

It was formed in 1992 by a small group of people  Bob Cordrey, Richard W. Harris, Robert Deering, and Lois Wolk, among others  who were concerned about the state of the urban forest in Davis and who wanted to increase citizen awareness of and involvement in issues concerning the urban forest.

Tree Davis offers a variety of programs and workshops, as well as technical advice, tree planting demonstrations, and workshops. Individuals and groups may participate in community planting projects and tree maintenance and pruning workshops. We also give classroom programs in local schools.

In 2002, the Tree Davis MemorialCommemorative Grove was created at the north end of the Evergreen Greenbelt, just south of the University Retirement Community.

In September 2006, a sculpture by artist Gilbert Menke was installed at the southeast corner of 2nd Street and D Street, in front of Coldwell Banker Doug Arnold Real Estate, Inc., next to which is a small pedestal containing brochures for the Downtown Davis Treewalk. The Downtown Davis Treewalk and sculpture received an award from the http://www.caufc.org/ California Urban Forests Council at the CAUFC 2007 Conference in San Francisco.

In the spring of 2008, we held four guided Downtown Davis Treewalks. They were led by  local experts Warren Roberts of the U.C.D. Arboretum, John Lichter of http://treeassociates.net/ Tree Associates, Ellen Zagory of the U.C.D. Arboretum, and Pamela Frickmann of the http://www.sactree.com/ Sacramento Tree Foundation. Well continue to have these walks each year.

On 9 June 2007 we held our first Artis Tree ArtisTree fundraiser. Our second on Artis Tree ArtisTree was held Saturday 3 May 2008, and our third was held 23 May 2009 at Central Park. In 2010, ArtisTree was held Friday, 12 February at the Odd Fellows Lodge, 415 Second Street.

On Saturday 16 February 2008, TREE Davis held two planting events on Highway 113 between West Covell Boulevard and County Road 29, adding 55 valley oak seedlings to the existing planting of oaks and California buckeyes, which were begun over a decade ago.

Weâ€™d like to thank Jim Thorne of the local chapter of the http://www.conbio.org/ Society for Conservation Biology, who provided the seedlings and helped plant them, Hibbert Lumber, who generously donated tools, and the 17 hardworking volunteers whose support made the plantings possible.

In years to come, the Highway 113 corridor will be greener, cleaner, and cooler as a result of these contributions.

http://www.arborday.org/arborday/ Arbor Day 2008 was observed on Saturday, 26 April, at Mace Ranch Community Park in East Davis. This year, Davis was recognized with its thirtieth consecutive Tree City USA award, an achievement shared by few other cities.

In the fall of 2008, PG&E sponsored a free shade tree program for the residents of Davis, Woodland, and Winters. After attending a workshop, applicants were able to select one of five trees (littleleaf linden, blue oak, London plane, Frontier elm, or sawleaf Zelkova) to plant on the east, south, or west side of their homes.
