20100803 11:47:47 nbsp So, cant wait for this to open.  Love the restaurant in Sac. Users/LokiAbbi

20100803 19:04:35 nbsp I am so excited! I have not been to the one in Sac. But I have been waiting for ever for a Mexican place in Davis. I will usually go to Marias in Dixon. La Esparanza in my opinion was not so great, and Agave is something a little different that an affordable sit down Mexican restaurant. I am happy to hear that it is good LokiAbbi.  Users/Sherri

20100803 20:08:36 nbsp This is my favorite Mexican restaurant, bar none!  We go to the one in Sac on a weekly basis.  Killer margaritas, amazing carnitas, and a great friendly atmosphere.  Davis will be thrilled to have a fabulous dine in Mexican restaurant again, I promise! Users/Davidlm

20100803 23:07:08 nbsp The one in Sac is great! I hope the Davis location lives up to their reputation. Users/jsogul

20100806 12:15:08 nbsp When is it supposed to open? I love good sit down mexican restaurants or taquerias like they have in the bay. For a California city, Davis could do better in Mexican food so I am excited for this place to open. Tacos and Beer is good too and Guads is passable for now (havent been to Aguave). Users/BryceH
     They hope to open in about 4 or 5 weeks.Users/Davidlm

20100807 17:02:33 nbsp This is a great step up.  Pasta? was not a great place, and there are plenty of Italian places in Davis  Davis really needs a good sit down Mexian place, and the other two Tres locations are great, so I anticipate this one will be as well. Users/rfrazier
  Dont get me wrong, Im happy about TH coming in and not shedding any tears over Pasta?s departure  but plenty of Italian places?  We have two: one upscale and one regular that some people seem to like (not me).   Users/CovertProfessor
   Agreed. Theres actually more Mexican than Italian in Davis already. But Tres will be way better than Pasta. Users/jsogul

20100920 09:01:57 nbsp Ive been by here twice (friday 9/17/10 and sunday 9/19/10) and confirmed that they plan on opening this morning. Ill be there for lunch! This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Sac. They have amazing carnitas, margaritas, and i love there enchiladas (mole and green).  Users/elliottPollard

20100923 16:44:08 nbsp Oh Boy! Today I drove by today to see if they had opened yet, like i have been doing every couple of days. (Yes, I am anxious) and they were serving lunch. I met the owner Sergio. He was very nice. I sat at the bar and because I had a dental appt in an hour and wasnt driving. I had a margarita. It was very good not to sweet and priced very reasonably. ( Top shelf $7.50 I think)I got some food to go for later. The chicken enchilada with a Mole sauce and a Chile Relleno. It came with soup, rice, beans and chips. It was delicious! I had never been to the Sac. locations. I didnt know what to expect. I just knew we have not had a real sit down Mexican food place in Davis as long as I have been here (10 years). I love Mexican food!!

Well worth the wait! Users/ashleyinthemist
BTW I wonder can someone make them a page?
  This is the page for their restaurant  people just need to start filling it in with info that they know.  People like you, who have been there.  :)   Users/CovertProfessor
   I guess what I meant is to have it on the list under Mexican. I am not sure how. Thanks:)
    Ah!  Ok.  Ive added the name of the restaurant to the Mexican (Latin American) restaurant page.  If you can fill out any of the information, please do!   Users/CovertProfessor


20100923 22:44:45 nbsp As I said in an earlier post, this is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Sacramento.  I will now say my favorite restaurant period.  We stopped by the new Davis location for lunch on Tuesday, on our way out of town.  Sergio, the manager whom weve  know for years from the Sacramento location, is in charge in Davis, and it is just as fabulous as their original location!  We shared a taco plate; crispy chicken for me, soft shrimp for my partner.  Excellent as always!  Salad or soup accompany the combos (I highly recommend the house cilantro dressing), along with beans and rice, and THE BEST chips and salsa for the table!  I will be here once a week, if I can get in! Users/Davidlm

20100925 19:52:01 nbsp Drove by tonight and it was packed! Looking forward to trying them out. Hopefully they live up to the hype.  Users/103

20100926 11:00:31 nbsp First visit (to the Davis location) this morning for breakfast, and what a great addition to downtown.  Enjoyed the huevos con carnitas, while Kara was quite satisfied with the huevos con chorizo.  We look forward to returning for dinner soon. Users/ScottLay

20100926 20:09:02 nbsp Good food, but wait until the dust settles before going for a weekend dinner.
We ate there last night and the service was super slow; we waited an hour and a half for our food.  Three other tables got up and left without eating during that time.  Some of the reasons were that they had one wait staff person for the ~15 tables outside, the chefs were behind, and the restaurant ran out of some of the food options.  HOWEVER, I really think that this was just growing pains from having just opened and that they will work it out.   Users/davisdebbie

20100926 20:21:30 nbsp Just went with our two kids tonight. The food was excellent  we had chicken enchiladas verde, chile relleno, and tacos. Would love some more outside tables, which were in high demand. As other people said, the service was slow, but theyve only been open a week and theyre probably just working out their system. The manager made a point of stopping by and apologizing for the wait and asking if we needed anything. Well definitely be back. Users/kristineg

20100927 10:56:00 nbsp I love the Sacramento location, and have really been looking forward to having Tres Hermanas here in Davis. Was planning on a birthday dinner there on Sunday night, and arrived just before 8 only to find that they close at 8 and were no longer seating. How disappointing! I realize it is a Sunday night, but to close for dinner at 8?!? 9 seems more reasonable, especially in a college town. I hope these are just temporary hours as the restaurant gets up and running. To close for dinner at 8 seems ridiculous. Still, I am really looking forward to eating there soon.  Users/EmilyTho

20100929 23:51:38 nbsp Great restaurant! Davis has been waiting for a restaurant like this for a long time.  The service was slow for a few days because they were working out all the kinks, but now they have most of their problems figured out.   Users/NicholasMarin

20100930 19:21:05 nbsp I have always heard that the restaurant in Sacramento was so good.  Well my husband and I went there for dinner tonight and we wont be going back.  The food was so unappetizing that I could hardly touched it. I had an enchilada, rice, black beans & a chile rellenos most of the meal was to full of fat, the chile was stuffed with cheese but  the breading nothing but mush.  The black beans, served in a small cup, were almost black bean soup with not much taste. I can not see how people can look at that plate and then eat it. I will take Dos Coyotes anytime! Users/carolharting

20101001 10:48:05 nbsp We picked up a menu and thought it was pretty expensive, I personally love Ernestos in Sacto, very well priced, excellent food, great drinks (Only downside is  you guess it  its in Sacto). Here, its basically $11$13 for everything, even the vegetarian stuff. Whatever, Ill give it a try, but I am skeptical. Bottom line for me is that Pasta is gone, happy about that. PS: If the restaurant/anyone else has time to merge the menu into 1 file, it would make it much easier to read, probably increase business because ppl in davis are lazy. PSS: This building is cursed. Users/GarrettGallegos
 Just added it! Users/elliottpollard

20101001 11:12:24 nbsp I would if I was more computer savy but, will someone put this restaurant under the Mexican food category? Thanks! Users/ashleyinthemist
  Its there now. Users/ARWENNHOLD

20101005 10:53:00 nbsp Had a great dinner with the family.  Yes, it is more expensive then the local taquerias....but it is definitely a step up in quality of menu choices.  I had the mole and it was great.  The portions are large, so I feel the prices were actually less because I had two meals from one order. The free chips and salsa are fantastic.  My son had the carnitas plate and loved it. We did not have an issue with waiting for service at all.  I definitely will be back. Users/LokiAbbi

20101008 22:14:23 nbsp Cant say the Chimichunga was anything but tiny. Great margaritas, okay food. They also have a couple Mexican microbrews. Users/ArmyDecoy

20101009 18:02:16 nbsp We have been twice already.  Great food, excellent service!  Food is wellpriced with a nice selection.  Great atmosphere.  Sangria was excellent.  A welcome addition to the Davis dining scene. Users/stodd84

20101009 18:08:27 nbsp Food is expensive. $1013 for most dishes and the portions are SMALL. The taste was okaynot horrible, but not worth the amount I paid. Service was OK. We went on a Saturday around noon. Despite more than half the tables being empty and about 56 waitresses it still took a long time to get our orders taken, a long time to get our food, a long time to get a water refill.  Users/lunelectronique

20101011 12:52:28 nbsp Had a great meal on Saturday night.  Cadillac Margarita was well worth the $10 price tag.  Verde sauce on the enchiladas (and other dishes as well) was tangy with just a tiny bit of heat  could use more heat in my opinion, but I like spicy food.  Some at our table thought the green sauce was plenty spicy.  Gringos.  Whatev.

Service was excellent. Food was very good.  Very glad that I dont have to drive to Vinces in Woodland or El Novillero in Sacramento to get a sitdown Mexican dinner.  Nice addition to the Davis scene.  I still miss Casa Hernandez on Olive Drive from back in the 80s, but this is much nicer and certainly more refined.

Kids menu is a nice feature.  Tequila selection has a nice broad crosssection of labels.  I would broaden the beer selection, but that may just be me.  Sol or Pacifico would be a nice addition.

Nice place.  Ill definitely be back.

 Users/browneyedblues

20101011 18:20:58 nbsp I must admit I was really looking forward to having this restaurant in Davis.  Having been to one in Sac which was fabulous, wouldnt it be great to have one here?
We were horribly disappointed.
We were a party of four and we arrived about 5:30 on a Saturday night.  The patio was empty with the exception of one couple at a table who were finishing their meal.  We requested a table outside.  We were told that all of the tables were reserved and we would need to wait 45 minutes!  This is BAD business.  We ate inside, and by the time we left over an hour later, there were STILL empty tables outside.
The service was dredful.  It took twenty minutes to ORDER cocktails.  Once we were given our drinks, the waitress was again no where to be found. We were never given silverwareour salads came with forks, but once those were removed we had nothing for our entrees.  We requested those but again had to wait.
Having been in the restaurant business for ten years (which is how I put myself through college) I have certain expectations AND I also tend to be somewhat more patient at times about some things.  One thing that I hate, however, is to see food auctioned off.  When a server comes out with food and needs to ask Who had the carnitas? when there are only four people at the tableits bad.  But the SAME thing happened to the couple who sitting next to us.  She had to ASK which of the TWO of them had the salad and which of them had the fajitasnow thats RIDICULOUS!  My husbands tortillas were brought in a dirty basket, which had old, brown. dried guacamole on the side.  The server should have noticed this before she brought it out.
The food was soso.  The cilantro cream salad dressing was wonderfulbut was lost on lettuce which was soaking wet.
Overall we found things very bland.  Seasonings were practically nonexistant.  I had the ceviche tostada.  It was a bit mushy and again, flavorless.
I know we were there fairly early in the evening but already I can see that this restaurant attracts a very different clientele than did Pasta?, the restaurant which was here previously.  Most customers were families with very young children, and in a manner typical of too many parents in our city, some were aloud to scream and roam around freely.
I was going to go back and try one more time before leaving a poor review, but our experience was terrible from the moment we entered, and didnt improve in the least over the course of our meal.  I believe these problems are a reflection of management, and NOT just part of working the kinks out of a new restaurant.
Perhaps Ill go again some day, and if my experience is different, Ill certainly edit this review.
 Users/toriac

20101011 22:47:50 nbsp It is so interesting how two people can go to a restaurant on the same day and have such opposite experiences. I was also there on Saturday afternoon. I had a wonderful meal with excellent service! I have been to Tres Hermanas 3 or 4 times since they opened and always a great experience. Users/Sherri

20101011 22:59:45 nbsp My husband Pete and I ate here for the third time on Friday, when we closed after the Artabout.  Even though it was packed, which says something just a few weeks after theyve opened, we had great service, and incredible food as always. As to slow service, really people, theyve been open less than a month!  They were not expecting to be this busy so quickly, and they are having trouble training a new staff for the entire restaurant!  Lets give them some time to work out the kinks already!  LOL. Users/Davidlm
 and I dont see how they can be blamed for bad parenting, by the way...

20101012 23:39:43 nbsp Stopped in for a family meal.  Two teens, two parentsEveryone really enjoyed their meal.  The service was good and the food was authentic.  Nice job for being open just a short while. Users/ThomasCorcoran

20101013 15:32:43 nbsp I went in a week ago and the food was a bit better than at the other Mexican restaurants here in Davis.  The Carne Asada was not truly asada as it is in most places down in Central or Southern California, but thats also true for the other Mexican places in Davis as well.  Carne asada should be grilled, not boiled and then grilled as Im told the process is like at many places.  Trust me, there is a difference.  Their prices are what will keep me away for the rest of the quarter.  As a student, I dont have $14 for a plate that I know SHOULD cost less.  But i guess this is a sit down restaurant, seeming to cater more to other Davis residents that are not students on smaller budgets.  Even then, Ive been to other Mexican sit down restaurants in the Central Valley and LA where the prices are half of what I paid for.

Also, according to their menu, they charge a $2 to split a plate and I forgot the amount for the gratuity for groups of 6 or more.   See ya next quarter! Users/Thatonedude

20101016 16:19:11 nbsp Mmm... I went in a couple days after they opened, and had what may have been the best chicken chimichanga Ive ever had in my life. Absolutely marvellous. Went again after theyd been open a week, and things were MUCH busier. Still not bad compared to most places Ive eaten. Most seating is four or six to a table, so if youre showing up with a large group, you may need to wait longer or call ahead. Users/Flynn

20101016 17:34:42 nbsp Glad you are here though not as good as the midtown location  yet! Users/creepergirl

20101016 18:27:48 nbsp Went to dinner Friday night at 8. The place was absolutely packed! Pasta? never had half the crowd. Waited about 10 minutes for a table outside and ordered a beer in the meanwhile at the bar  theyve got Sudwerks Hefe Weisen, Boone, and about 6 other beers on tap. Once we got seated, the service was actually rather prompt considering how busy they were. Now.. the food. The chips were great, possibly made fresh, and the salsa was great as well, and Im not usually big on salsa. The salad was soso, but whatever, Mexican places arent known for their salads. I got the carne asada & chicken mole combo dinner for $14; the portion was _just right_. I was relatively hungry and was filled up, but didnt get in danger of overeating. If you are a big guy or really big appetite though, you could be disappointed. On the other hand, the price is absolutely perfect for what you get. As for flavor, the carne asade was good, but not particularly special (its a simple dish after all). The chicken mole though was a delight; the chicken was fried to crispiness under the sauce, and they used sesame seeds which gave the mole a fantastic flavor; for this dish, I wish I had enough to overeat! All in all, one of the best restaurants Ive been to in Davis with great flavor and price.  Users/AndrewPotter

20101019 09:01:01 nbsp I went here for the second time last Saturday with a group of 4. We were lucky to get a table right away because it was totally packed! The service was great. We are those people that eat multiple baskets of chips and several things of salsa, and they were so quick we basically had a never ending supply, even though there was a full house. I got a margarita, and just like the one in Sac, they are perfectly strong and delicious. One of my favorite things about tres is that there food is always very temperature hot, which is not always the case at some Mexican restaurants that Ive been to before. I had the carnitas and that pork tamale, and both were prefect. I normally get a verde enchilada and a mole enchilada (which are some of the best ive ever had) but wanted to try something new, and I was very happy with my decision. There prices are a little high compared to other Mexican places in davis, but I dont think that there food is overpriced. Their portions are very large, and I almost always have leftovers unless Im specifically fasting for a huge feast. ha. Overall I think that this is my new favorite place to eat in Davis, and will be back here as much as I can.  Users/elliottPollard

20101025 15:27:59 nbsp My husband and I ate dinner at the bar. I am usually not a fan of margaritas, because they are too sweet for my taste. But their margaritas were very fresh and not too sweet. Chips and salsa were delicious and addicting. I had the vegetarian fajitas, and loved it! I love, love, love Mexican food and it is great to finally have a nice Mexican restaurant in Davis. We had a great dining experience here. They have a lot of vegetarian options, which is hard to find. I cant wait to go back and try another great vegetarian meal! Users/Kristina86

20101110 20:52:44 nbsp Like others, I was really excited that were finally getting a sitdown Mexican restaurant here in Davis. Like others, Id also been to the Tres Hermanas in downtown Sac. Sadly, my experience here was not as good. My friend, my brother, my wife, and myself all went to Tres Hermanas last night and we all agreed that it tasted weird. Not bad, per se (none of us gagged), but certainly not good and not something Id spend $12 on again. My wife complained that the vegetarian tamale had a strange milky taste to it and surprisingly few vegetables—just lots of corn masa. So I guess its Pacos in Woodland still for us (or Taquieria Davis for something local). :( Users/RobertM525

20101113 14:07:17 nbsp I will never eat here again. I am still pissed about how much I paid for horrible enchiladas. I went there today for lunch with my friend. We BOTH ordered enchiladas, two for 10.99, which is expensive in the first place. For mine, I got cheese and beef, and for hers, she got both beef. She paid the 10.99. I had to pay 11.99 because I got MIXED. Meaning that my cheese enchilada cost a 1.00 more than her beef. Does that make any freakin sense to you? So, total for my check, I paid 15 bucks for one plate of enchiladas, because I included a 2.00 tip. I only had water, but they gave my friend diet coke when she asked for just a regular coke. VERY expensive mexican food. And so not worth it in flavor, which tastes horrible. Last night I had dos coyotes 3 meals for 20 bucks. Again, I will never go here again. Sorry.  Users/JamieParker

20101116 21:03:27 nbsp Went there for lunch  food was okay, but too expensive for a Davis lunch place.  Most items are $11 or $12.  They dont have an a la carte menu, which they really need  Davis lunch folks expect to be able to eat for ~$6 or $7 I think.  The fish tacos had very little flavor, even after adding the salsa that came with the chips.  Needs some good sauce on it or more flavorful fish or something.  Chile verdes my friend had was good. Users/RudyGramage

20101116 21:04:12 nbsp The sign I saw for happy hour was 36, not 35 like the wiki says... Users/RudyGramage

20101116 21:36:33 nbsp Just finished another great dinner at Tres Hermanas. The food is always the most flavorful I get anywhere. There were a few bumps with service when they first opened, but its been smooth recently. I love the house dressing on the salad that is included with every entree. The tortillas are the best you can find  always hot and fresh. The food is extremely flavorful is clearly made with fresh ingredients. GREAT margaritas and other drinks. Im definitely a fan.  Users/pnowlen

20101119 20:28:02 nbsp The customer service sucks!! They dont refill drinks or check up on you at all. They take 15 or 20 minutes just to take your order. I will never go here again. The food was nothing special and is way over priced.  Users/mdub

20101120 17:02:29 nbsp This place is amazing. went with my fraternity last night. About 20 of us with our dates and they got us our food in like 5 minutes. i walked less than a block before I realized I forgot my keys and by they time i got back, the place was wiped clean. They are INSANELY efficient and the food is DELICIOUS!!!!! Great Mexican food and Im from San Diego, so thats saying something. All  my mexican friends agreed as well. Trust me, just go there!!! Users/MattCorey

20101126 20:42:12 nbsp Went tonight to Tres Hermanas. I was hesitant after so many poor reviews, but I figured it deserved a fair shot. My party was seated immediately and promptly provided with water and chips. The waitress came and got our order reasonably quick. Our food came out blazing fast. Hot and fresh. Everything was delicious. Not too expensive, either. Three of us plus alcohol was only $30. Definitely a good place to go for Mexican food.  Users/JessH

20101128 08:26:39 nbsp Our family/friends have gone here a couple times this month and we really like the food; it does seem expensive for the size of the portions. For example, the dinner salads are amazingly meager(I know, thats not why we are there), and the chimichanga was the smallest ever seen. We want leftovers for tomorrow! Contrary to previous post of 3 for $30, the other day our 4 dinners and 1 beer & tip(no other drinks)was $60. Seating is to communal for our liking be nice to have a bit more privacy when with your group Users/RichardL

20101205 09:57:39 nbsp My son and I went here last night. The food was fantastic. We stared off with margaritas at the bar since there were no tables ready. They said it would be about 15 minutes. We waited maybe 5 minutes and our table was ready. Re: the margaritas: we have had better.

My son ordered a second called drink margarita rather than the house tequila and that margarita was MUCH better. We next had the bean dip as an appetizer. Quickly served  hot, yummy and fresh. I ordered the fish taco plate with a house salad, my son ordered a pork tamale and pork tacos with the soup. EACH item was hot, fresh, authentic, and delicious. We will definitely go again. It is nice to have a sit down Mexican place in town. Sorry to say it isnt as good as Zocalos in Sacramento though. got

I almost forgot. The chips and salsa were immediately served  great kick to the salsa, chips were warm and crispy  not greasy.  Users/PeriSiepman

20110107 22:06:00 nbsp I went here tonight with my two friends for the first time.  We were going there to celebrate a bonus and we were excited to try a new, fun place.  We got there at about 8:45 on a friday night, so things were starting to slow down a little bit.  We got our drinks  food right away, but as soon as the waitress dropped our food off, she never came back to the table, not even to fill our very small water glasses.  We were sitting towards the front in a booth and our server was sitting on one of the bar tables eating, talking to coworkers, and rolling silverwarenot once looking over at us.  After we were done with our meals, we had to flag down another server to ask for water.  He was very attentive and asked us how we were doing and then reminded our server that she still had a table.  Even after coming to the table to give us a box and our somewhat expensive check, she never asked my boyfriend if he wanted a second eight dollar margarita (which he did and never received.)  I realize its a Friday night and she probably wanted to go out and party, but this place doesnt close until tenwe were out the door by 9:30 and when we left, she was sitting in the exact same spot she was in since we arrived. We felt rushed the entire time and wished we had driven out of Davis for our celebration.  The food was good, but the service was HORRIBLE.  My party and I all agreed that we have gotten better service at Applebees.  It really put a damper on our evening out. Users/CourtneyMullarkey

20110108 09:14:18 nbsp My family and I visited for New Years Eve. The service was attentive, the food was excellent and we loved the ambiance. The only problem we had was we felt a bit rushed to get out the door. We were being handed our check not even half way into our meal and the male server kept returning to collect it like we were about to blow the joint. The place wasnt even that busy. It was actually a disappointing end to what was otherwise a fantastic meal. We will most definitely visit again eventually, but if that happens again, it will most likely be the last return visit.

20110123 15:48:50 nbsp READ THIS! DO NOT GO HERE! One of the staff members swiped my moms brand new iphone after we had just finished eating lunch there last week. It was one of four staff members there including the manager. They turned off the phone in the middle of me calling it so we didnt know which one it was. The next day the person had nerve to play scrabble against my sister! So DO NOT EAT HERE!there food isnt even that goodits bland and its expensive. Go to El Mariachi, its nearby, cheaper and tastes better. Users/mindybacharach

20110125 10:29:42 nbsp I have been here several times. Always good food and service. I have a hard time believing that the wait staff stole a phone. They have all been professional in my experience.  The food here is different then the other mexican food places, so you cant really compare it to El Mariachi. The atmosphere and selection of menu items are a step up from the taquerias.  So, yes it is more expensive.  But, in my opinion, it is worth it.  I like El Mariachi too, but when I want a nicer sit down meal, I will choose Tres everytime. Users/LokiAbbi

20110206 18:29:23 nbsp Serious concerns about the veracity of the stolen iPhone accusation by an unregistered user.  Should it stay? Users/ScottLay

20110207 17:24:57 nbsp I would like to confirm the experience of another writer on Davis Wiki. I was the person whose iphone was stolen. I walked into the restaurant with a phone (I received a call during lunch) and left without a phone. It was around 1 pm when we were leaving and the restaurant was quiet. We (a party of 4) were in the last booth. It would have been difficult for another patron to reach across a booth and steal the phone as we left.I was sitting in the corner. As we left the restaurant, I began to reach for my keys and realized that my phone was missing. I went back to our table, fully expecting the phone to
be sitting on the table in the hands of one of the servers. The table was completely cleared and there was no phone to be had. I searched under the table, in the booth crevices and still no phone. I had the others in my party search my purse, no phone. I did not make it to my car before realizing that the phone was missing so I know it was not in the car. One of the employees suggested calling the phone, we did. It rang once, and then was immediately turned off. After that, the phone went straight to the message machine. As you reflect, another oddity was that the server only filled my ice tea glass half full. Have you ever been to a restaurant where they only fill you up half way? I believe she was trying to get us to leave. This restaurant was recommended to us and we went in good faith. I left a healthy tip only to have leave much lighter than anticipated.
The staff refused to ask their people. They said no one took the phone. I did not call the police. In retrospect, I should have stood my ground and phoned the police. I was with my elderly mother who had a Dr. appt. and a Davis student who needed to get to class. In my frustration and anger, I just left. We were not rude but did tell them that someone in their establishment is a thief. That is the story. There are 4 witnesses. I tell everyone I know to be careful before entering this establishment.

20110208 21:59:57 nbsp TWO THUMBS UP!  Just went to their first tequila tasting and it was an allaround fantastic evening.  The owner (Sergio) is great  super personable and even served our table!  Chile Colorado was simply sublime.  The margarita with Gran Centenario Rosangel was easily the best margarita Ive had.  You simply CANNOT beat the price ($25) for a flight of 6 fine tequilas (and the knowledge to boot), dinner, and a margarita (with an expensive tequila, no less!).  This was their first tequila and they plan to have more (every 1st or 2nd Tuesday of the month).

Yeah, theres a lot of negative reviews from November but they had literally JUST opened and were trying to get their feet on the ground and hit Davis with a fantastic menu and great service.  Sergio said they had been having trouble with their waitstaff so that may explain your issues (to all you people who had your phones stolen).

They have fantastic happy hour specials mentioned above and those $4 margaritas would be SO worth it.  I think we may have convinced Sergios wife to bring sopapillas to Davis!

We will DEFINITELY be returning to Tres Hermanas for some great food, good service, and delicious drinks :) Users/MichelleChinoraks

20110303 13:46:03 nbsp Went here for dinner for the first time last night, and I am definitely going back. The food was delicious and the service was great. I was honestly impressed with how prompt the wait staff was with our food and drinks. Loved the vegetarian options.  Users/septemberain

Do you know how irresponsible it to accuse someone without evidence! I have had many meals there and the staff was wonderful. The food is always hot fresh and delicious! Please where is your PROOF! Users/Sherri

20110314 21:40:31 nbsp I went here awhile back and enjoyed myself quite a bit.  I expected small portions, given some of the comments here, but my dish was not at all small, in fact it was quite large.  The fajitas were really tasty, maybe the best Ive ever had.  The mole was very soso, though (is there a good place in Davis for mole?).  Waitstaff was nice, decor was nice.  Definitely a nice sit down Mexican meal experience.  Users/CovertProfessor

20110324 17:14:11 nbsp True its a bit expensive for Mexican food which usually tends to be more affordable.   I loved their vegetarian fajitas, so so good! The beans are delish, the rice a little dry but with good flavor, and the carnitas are very yummy. The kids cant wait to go there again.  Margaritas are good but too small for the price.  Wish this place was less expensive so I could dine there more frequently.  Users/YogiJen

20110422 13:04:41 nbsp Went to Tres Hermanas for lunch today. The chips were fresh but a little greasy. The salsa was good. I ordered the chicken chimichanga lunch special with soup. The soup came out very hot and had a very good taste to it. The chimichanga was tasty as well as the rice and beans. Service was good, with little wait for soup and lunch. I will eat here again.

20110505 23:56:08 nbsp I still havent eaten here, but my wife and I dropped by tonight for Cinco de Mayo for a couple hours with a vet school crowd and had a good time.  The bouncers and bar tenders were extremely friendly, the margarita pours were pretty generous (although not cheap), and the atmosphere was nice.  They turned off the music for quite a while before a live band got going, which was weird (no iPod?), but we had a great time hanging out.  There was a pretty good crowdit was lively, but not unpleasantly crowded. Users/TomGarberson

20110506 20:00:56 nbsp I have eaten here several times throughout the past year and the experience has been enjoyable.  Promt service, delicious food, what else could one ask for?  However, I went there last night on Cinco de Mayo to watch my friends band perform and my experience was mixed.  The positive: after I stepped out to make a phone call, the bouncer did let me back in through the side door so I didnt have to wait in the massive line.  The negative:  the bartender, without warning, was charging $6.50 for the drink specials that were advertised as being $4.  Ok, fine, its Cinco de Mayo, drinks are going to be more expensive, I have no problem with that.  However, if you are going to increase your prices, TAKE DOWN THE SIGN that advertises the normal price in huge letters at the bar.  The surprise 40% price increase was pretty dickish if you ask me. Users/MikkoSolomon

20110522 15:33:46 nbsp If you are an artist, musician, or DJ...DO NOT BOOK YOURSELVES HERE! They will charge for their bouncers that let everyone in for free (so you dont even get your cover fee) and claim that they didnt make any $$$ so they dont have to pay you what you deserve. This happened to my friends, its not worth your time to entertain for this shady business. Users/TracyR

20110617 13:26:00 nbsp We really like the Carnitas here. Though the menu doesnt offer carnitas in all the items, you can request that they substitute it. Didnt really care for any of the beef dishes, but the carnitas and chicken have been great every time. First couple times we came here we ended up spending over $30 for two people which is a bit expensive for us, especially for mexican, but weve found a way to get our order down to $21 by getting 3 cripsy tacos a la carte( $3.00 each and theyre way better than the soft tacos((substitute carnitas obviously)) and the Enchilada combo with the mole sauce and house cilantro salad ($11, substitute carnitas obviously). It comes with chips and salsa and is lot more food than two people should eat. Users/MikeyCrews

20110711 00:19:11 nbsp Worst Mexican food Ive ever had...and I dont say that lightly. Any promising flavors were bland and/or overpowered by...well...notsogood flavors. Still looking for a good sitdown Mexican place around here... Users/MusicGuy
 20110711 06:41:08 nbsp It isnt cheap, but if youre looking for really fantastic Mexican food, often with a twist, check out wiki:sacramento:Zocalo in Midtown Sacramento.

    Because when people are complaining that theres no good sitdown Mexican in Davis, or that TH doesnt provide what theyre looking for, a good alternative seems relevant. Users/TomGarberson
   My office is two blocks from Zocalo, and I had lunch there yesterday.  I like Zocalo, but I also think that Tres Hermanas is pretty darn good, and a welcome addition to Davis.  Ive had several things, usually before jumping on a trainsalad, carnitas, even breakfastand have never been disappointed.  I love our taquieras (particularly Taquiera Davis and El Mariachi), but Tres Hermanas serves a different purpose.  I travel to Mexico at least once a year, have eaten in amazing Mexican towns like Oaxaca and Merida, appreciate the diversity of Tres Hermanass food, and I havent found their food particularly lacking for a NorCal establishment.  Users/ScottLay

20110714 10:23:26 nbsp O.K so I posted here recently about never having a bad experience at TH. Last night I did. The chicken enchiladas with Mole was so greasy I just could not eat it. There were puddles of grease. When the waitress came by I told her. She said she would tell the manager. He never came by. So After waiting forever I finally just left. I did not expect him give me the world I just thought he could at least hear what I had to say. Especially since I am a regular customer.  Users/ashleyinthemist

20110715 23:24:11 nbsp I finally had dinner here tonight for the first time.  Ive been for happy hour before and found the staff friendly, the drinks just fine.

Dinner pros: the fajitas are very tasty.
Dinner cons: almost everything else.  The soup of the day, arroz con pollo, had very little flavor and, oddly enough, no rice (if anyones not familiar, arroz is rice).  Instead of rice, it had vermicelli.  It just wasnt any good.  The salsa and chips they brought out were decent.  Nothing particularly noteworthy.  Probably the weirdest thing about the meal is that they only brought two tortillas at a time for the fajitas.  They bring out this great big basket... with two smallish folded tortillas.  Im all in favor of fresh tortillas and whatnot, but two?  Seriously?  Its basically a big empty basket.  I had to ask for more, and it took at least 10 minutes to getyou guessed ittwo more tortillas in a whole new big basket.  Service was slow and a little strange.  Im guessing our server was new because she seemed a bit awkward.  One of the bussers came and asked if I was done while I was in the process of taking a bite.  My fork was literally in my mouth, and there was still food on my plate.  We also had to wait quite a while for water refills (very small glasses).

That said, the fajitas were tasty.  The prices were significantly higher than most of the Mexican in Davis, but not all that much higher than a Chevys or something along those lines.  Fajitas were $13, and the enchiladas both of my friends got were $12 each (one got chicken with mole and liked it a lot, the other got cheese with red sauce and liked it pretty well).

All in all, Im a little bit iffy about going back there.  If everything had been as good as the fajitas, Id be more forgiving about the bad service and the somewhat high prices.  Given that the soup was worse than what youd get from a can and the salsa was quite dull, Id call the food quality inconsistent at best.  That said, if Im out with a group and people want to go, I wont object to getting some more tasty chicken fajitas.  Ill probably stick to salad instead of the crappy soup, though. Users/TomGarberson

20110727 16:25:43 nbsp I have eaten here twice now. First time was mediocre, at best. That was a couple months ago, so today the girlfriend and I decided to give it another go. Our first indication should have been that there was no one there to greet us. After a minute or two the bartender came over and seated us and brought us menus and water. After deciding, and waiting another 5 or 6 minutes, the bartender again noticed we were not being helped and came from across the restaurant and took our order. A few minutes later the waitress finally appeared and brought us chips and salsa, which she practically threw on the table before walking off. Never even made eye contact, and seemed highly irrated that she had to bring us chips. Food took some time to make despite a completely empty building. The pulled pork taco was terrible, no flavor at all. As was the chicken tacos my girlfriend got. The pork slices taco was decent, but still pretty bland. We never saw the waitress again, and the bartender took care of us the rest of the time we were there. After we left, we didnt even make it the 5 minute journey home before my girlfriend was feeling sick. When we got home 5 or 6 minutes after leaving, she ran straight to the bathroom and puked everything back up. Even after puking, she still feels sick. I dont feel terribly great myself, but I dont think I am going to puke. I give Tres Hermanas a 1 out of 5. If not for the observant bartender, we would have gotten up and left. Avoid this place at all costs, there are much better places to eat in Davis. Users/angrychair
  sorry you had a bad experience there. While I am not affiliated in any way with the restaurant, I do know the woman you are referring to and we both shared a death of a mutaul friend who was found this morning in his apartment... probably explains the poor service. Might want to visit them again another time just to be fair.  Users/WesP

20110802 10:14:22 nbsp Ive been to the Tres in Sac many times, and I really enjoy their food. The location in Davis just isnt up to those standards, for some reason. Ive found the service inattentive and the food hasnt been as good. Obviously there are different people involved in a new location, but Im not sure why its so hard to make the same food at both places. I hope they get it straightened out, but at the moment Illl eat at other places in Davis and save Tres for when Im in Sac. Users/MattCzarnowski

20110918 20:05:02 nbsp Went for dinner Sunday night at 7, and for the first time Ive seen it Tres wasnt packed to the gills (though I havent been here in a couple months). Ive been here many times since my first visit that caused me to give it a raving review for the food, but ever since that first time the food has never been amazingrather its fallen to Okay standards. Usually what beckons me back is the chips and salsa, although this is a gamble. Sometimes the salsa is mild, other times it burns fiercely. But when its hot it is also delicious. All in all I still think its a good value, but it is unlikely it will blow your socks off. Users/AndrewPotter

20111018 17:56:43 nbsp completely disappointed after my visit (literally visit) the other night. i was craving mexican food one night and checked out their hours of operation to see that they were open until ten. i get there and after waiting for someone to attend me. the waiter looked at me in a weird way and asked if i needed help. i mean hellooo i want to be seated, what else would i want? so he tells me that they are closed. i then told them if they closed at ten and then some other guy (seemed like a guy with manager type position) tells me that they were getting ready for an event that night. what kind of business turns down a hungry customer? completely unreliable for your craving needs. i will not be going back there.

20120211 13:26:30 nbsp I have had friends who went to Tres and had fairly good comments about the place, so I decided to check it out with my roommate and a few of our friends. My roomie and our friends went ahead first because I still had work at Sac to finish up. When I got back and got ready, my roomie left Tres to pick me up, and when we came back, a big bouncer guy with dark hair (probably the biggest of the ones we saw outside just for clarification as to which one) wouldnt let us in!! Even when my roommate showed her stamp of her hand she got earlier and I showed my ID (I am over 21!) they wouldnt give me a stamp, ACCUSED us of lying, ACCUSED us of having left and changed our clothes, and even had the GALLS to say I wasnt born yesterday.

We were speechless!! We have NEVER been treated so badly by any other bar in Davis! In another story from the very same night, one of our friends who is also Hispanic (like my roommate) was harassed INSIDE the place, being asked questions such as how did you get in? She was so confused and angry she met up with us outside, told us of what happened, and we concluded the guys inside must have thought she was my roommate! Are they RACIST?? Do we look like every other Asian and Hispanic in the area, much less the WORLD?? We are NEVER going back to this place again due to the horrible way we were treated by racist people who couldnt tell us apart from one girl to the next and who still accused us of lying!!!

20120506 20:25:45 nbsp After reading the reviews regarding this place, I decided to try the food out with my family. We arrived at about 5:40pmish, so the place wasnt really busy at the moment. We were warmly greeted and seated promptly.We were given ice water and the salsa + chips (which tasted pretty good. Spicy, but not overly spicy). When we looked over the menu, a waiter with a jovial face came and asked us if we wanted anything to drink. We politely declined and said water is all we needed. Almost immediately, the waiter lost the happy greeting face and curtly told us that he will be back to service us again after we have decided on our food to order. In the end, my family and I ordered from the combinaciones 2,8, and 11 (ordering Carnitas and Carne Asada), with starters being a soup and two salads, one with the house sauce and the other being ranch. During the ordering, it was very noticeable that the waiter was impatient (irritated?), and simply wanted to service any other table than ours. When the soup and salad came, the soup turned out fine, but the sauce for the salads tasted quite bland, and was very waterylike. For instance, the ranch sauce had no viscosity to it, and when you pick up a piece of lettuce, the sauce will drip off the lettuce, and onto your plate. When our entrees arrived, everything looked great. However, we found that the food didnt have much taste to it at all. Most of the food didnt seemed to have been seasoned nor cooked very well  the grilled sirloin for order 8 was rather burnt, the fried pork (carnitas) definitely did not have a citrus flavor to it, but tasted bland. Pretty much, the food was tasteless. Maybe it was just my family and I, but we didnt really get wowed or comment on how good the food was cooked. Furthermore, given as to how our waiter treated us, we didnt feel too happy after the meal.
Summation: 1  poor, 3  ok, 5  Great
Taste: 2.5
Service: 2 (Just because we didnt want any alcoholic drinks, I dont think we should be treated differently from the other tables that did order drinks.)
Price: About slightly more than average. We ended up with each person coming up to $1516 for their meal. The decorations and design of the place looks nice, but the food absolutely needs some work.
Lastly, I absolutely do not think I will go there again until I see consecutive reviews about them having great food again or how they have improved.

20120528 18:37:01 nbsp Ate here with my girlfriend earlier today. The place was empty, yet the service was terrible. Didnt bring chips or water for at least 5 minutes after we were sat. Didnt ask us if we wanted any drinks until he finally came back maybe 10 minutes after leaving us with the menus. The food was prepared quickly, but was on par with the service. The chips were stale, the carnitas tacos I ordered were incredibly dry. My girlfriend didnt have many complaints about her dinner plate until we got home. She is in the bathroom throwing up as I type this. My stomach hurts as well but I dont think I will throw up. I would avoid this place, Dos Coyotes is about the only decent mexican food in Davis. 1 out 5 stars on Tres Hermanas. More like Muy Enferma. Users/angrychair
    You left a similar review about a year ago (July 2011).  Almost the exact same in some parts!  She got sick, but you managed to not hurl ;)  After we left, we didnt even make it the 5 minute journey home before my girlfriend was feeling sick. When we got home 5 or 6 minutes after leaving, she ran straight to the bathroom and puked everything back up. Even after puking, she still feels sick. I dont feel terribly great myself, but I dont think I am going to puke. I give Tres Hermanas a 1 out of 5. If not for the observant bartender, we would have gotten up and left.

Your http://daviswiki.org/Taqueria_Guadalajara?actiondiff&version2273&version1272 other review of a taqueria also had you throwing up...    Perhaps you should see a medical services doctor instead.)

20120608 12:43:07 nbsp Went here last night for dancing. I was very excited as I had a couple of friends with me from out of town. We waited in line for an hour and realized the line was barely moving. There were A LOT of people who had cut in front of us and the security seemed to do nothing about it. When we finally got to the front he started accusing us of moving forward. He kept asking us why are you guys moving forward Im not letting you in... Instead of politely asking us to step back he kept on repeating the same thing over and over and giving us a lot of attitude for no reason. We tried explaining to him that the people behind us kept on pushing us so we kept falling forward. Instead of telling everyone to not push and take a step back he kept on yelling at us. Finally my friends got upset and told him that we are not trying to move forward we are getting pushed and he wouldnt believe us and told us that if we dont stop he would put up the railing and not let anyone else in. It was ridiculous because he had to be about 65 and could easily see over the whole crowd and see that everyone was pushing and shoving and cutting yet he did not do anything about it. He also let in half of my friends and stopped the other half from coming in, WHILE letting two other girls in who cut in front of us RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIS EYES. After all this happened we also heard him say that he was only going to let in 2 more people and they had to be 2 good looking girls. By this point my friends and I were very upset and couldnt believe he was discriminating people based on their looks.
Ive noticed other comments about the bouncers being very rude to the customers and Im pretty sure it is the same bouncer doing this over and over. It was a very embarrassing night for me, the restaurant itself, and even the City of Davis. I cant imagine what my out of town friends must think of the people of Davis. I brag all the time about how nice everyone here is and this one experience completely ruined that for me. That one bouncer has ruined my perception of the type of people that work and run and this restaurant. Wont be going back here. again. Ketmoree is A LOT BETTER for dancing... highly recommended.   Users/S.S.

20120608 18:35:34 nbsp Spoke to the manager about an issue we had with the bouncer there last night and I could not believe how rude he was! He told me that the people cutting us were regulars when I have been going there for every single weekend for OVER A MONTH. I told them to read their reviews on daviswiki and he flat out told me he does not care what people think and told me to go somewhere else. All I tried telling him how rude the bouncer was, that he kept accusing us of moving forward when we clearly being pushed and also felt he was being racist. But the manager wanted nothing to do with it, told me he was busy and cut the phone. DONT GO THERE!!!!

Went here to dance last night hoping for a fun night with my friends. Heres no happened:

Decided to go since they have no cover.

Bouncers were unable to maintain control of the line. (There were plenty of obvious cutters)

Bouncers lack decent customer service and have obvious ego issues. Treated customers like trash.

A bouncer threw someone out very aggressively, and the guy ran into people waiting in line trying to get in.

If they treated us like that in person, I cannot imagine what they do to our food and drinks.

20120624 06:24:36 nbsp Straight up rudeness!!!!  My wife and some friends were at the Davis Music Fest last night and stopped at tres for a few drinks.  We had a total of 4 house margaritas between my wife and I.  When we were about to leave iasked for our portion of the check which came to $30.  I left a $10 tip at the table and went inside to pay the tab with my card.  I put no tip on the ticket and when our server, who was also the manager apparently, saw that he rudely said to me, thanks for the tip!. I told him that he was extremely rude and that I would not be returning as well as telling my friends to not eat here!  He just shrugged me off!  I mean who does this?  I gave him a $10 tip on a $30 ticket!  Do not go here, after reading the other posts here it is very apparent to me that this place needs to be boycotted by the community so that the owners and management realize that you cant treat people in this community this way and stay in buisness.  I will never go back here! Users/smileygladhands

20121007 17:54:41 nbsp Our family of four went for the first time on a Saturday evening.  We received friendly, attentive service.  We loved the salsa, especially our children, ages 2 and 6.  It was spicy but not overly so.  I enjoyed the carnitas, our 6 yearold enjoyed the childs enchilada plate, and the boys enjoyed a burrito combination plate.  We never wanted for a thing.  Our chips and salsa were immediately refilled, our food arrived hot and timely, and we left with empty plates and happy tummies.  Prior to finishing my dish, I plotted the next visit.  Its comfort food in a relaxing environment.  What more could an exhausted mother ask for (except a trip to the spa, a gorgeous hotel, blue ocean......)?

20121119 17:00:37 nbsp this is a pretty fun bar in davis. ive never eaten there but have been to the night club plenty of times. they have a decent variety of music being played there and a big dancing area. most of the time its packed and there is no cover either. and as much as i have enjoyed this place in the past 2 years, i recently had an experience that made me dawn upon a lot of things about tres, and after reading a couple other reviews we can conclude that the people that work there are morally corrupt. i dont know about the food servers since ive never eaten there (according to several other reviews the same can be said about them), but the evening staff is seriously sick in the head. because after going there for a while and experiencing it myself, there are some very disturbing patterns that are emerging about team tres that i would like to share with everyone, just so you are aware of their existence: they enjoy watching people get absolutely drunk beyond their imagination, they watch countless people get sick out front and laugh at them for being too drunk after selling them loaded coronas (3 of those will take an average person to oblivion), the bouncers promote aggressive behavior by being overly rude to anyone that questions them especially when other people cut in line and you have to wait, they treat their clients like ignorant children (and yes, you do get special treatment from the bouncers as a regular or if you have really big tits), the inside staff allows other people with the same sick mindset to go in there to prey on innocent drunken girls, the bouncers act like they have some sort of overlord entitlement over their clients because they wear a tshirt that says team tres and this somehow makes them superior to say whatever BS they want to avoid conflict after ENCOURAGING outrageous behavior to create conflict in the first place (ie allowing people to cut in line), while most bouncers will turn away people for being too drunk team tres will allow anyone in (even if they are falling over blacked out already), they dont really care if something bad happens to you so they will sell you as many drinks as your credit card can buy, and if something bad does happen to you they will side with the person that caused the bad thing while you are left lying in the bushes for the cops to pick you up. these are just some general trends i have noticed at tres by observing this bar over time, and there are lots of other specific examples that prove all this. also, i understand that this can be said about pretty much any bar, but i have definitely not seen such a massive degree of immorality anywhere else in davis (ok maybe at ket mo ree but i dont ever go there for that sole reason). and im not trying to deter anyone from going because yes, tres is a pretty fun bar if you are responsible and dont get too drunk, but a lot of people can agree that tres is the place everyone goes to black out. its the bar college kids go to after drinking themselves into oblivion before going out, only to buy more drinks when they get there on their parents unlimited credit card. and its also the place a lot of creepy guys go to to prey on drunk girls (there are other bars with more creepers, tres isnt the worst). and after seeing how rudely the bouncers treated my friend the other night (who has been there many times as well), i realized that this type of stuff probably happens every night and to a lot more people than myself. i agree with the fact that most drunk people do act like ignorant children and should be more responsible, but that doesnt allow the staff to make fun of them after promoting a state of complete oblivion. hopefully now you have a perspective of the type of place tres is and can make your own wise decision whether you want to continue going there or not. im definitely not going back there anymore because this is seriously disturbing to me and there are plenty of other bars in davis with a much more positive atmosphere. so you can go party there as much as you like, but just know that this is a sick, morally corrupt bar. ok rant over thanks for reading :) Users/MariaSav

20121120 13:02:23 nbsp Never had anything but good experiences here. We visit occasionally for dinner as a family. I wouldnt say the service is out of this world, but its fair. The food is excellent and the prices are very fair. Definitely a better dining experience than Pasta?, which previously inhabited this spot. Users/BrianPakpour

20121220 12:34:43 nbsp decent food, atrocious customer service Users/NorteMansion

20130323 19:03:55 nbsp Ive been here many times (at least 30), and Ive never had anything but excellent service. Their happy hour specials are what really get methe carne asada street tacos are AMAZING, and the margaritas are yummy (and not skimpy on the booze). Ive never come for the bar/dancing, so I cant comment on that. But the nonhappy hour specials are also deliciousId say around the same prices as Dos Coyotes. And seriously, when the weathers nice, I could eat the street tacos five times a week. Users/zombiek

20130721 15:08:15 nbsp Boycott Tres Hermanas in Davis ,ca. The owner is an insensitive homophobic asshole, who allows his employees to call customers Bitches. The owner had the nerve to call me a dyke bitch when he thought i had left, and to get my ugly face out of there. This was all because a girl got punched in the face and i stood up for her when she tried to get ice for her swollen face. The owner of Tres hermanas wouldnt allow her to grab some ice, and when she pleaded with them the employee called her a bitch. I over heard the convo and stepped in. The employee wouldnt give up his name and when i asked to speak with his manager the owner came out. Right away he was very defensive and flat out told me that his employee can call anyone anything. Thats when he started calling me names. The owner flat out said that she probably deserved being called a bitch anyway. I spoke with an officer also, but due to it being a nonviolent situation there was not much i could do other than report them. Tres Hermanas will be investigated.The owner has already been reported to the City of Davis for reveiw ,along with many reports from witnesses to the Better Business Bureau. No one deserves to be treated the way they treated us. On top of this, heads up to my gay community! Tres Hermanos is not Gay friendly! Dont waste another dime in this horrible place! The owner needs to get with the times or pack it up already. Users/SarahClark88

20130722 10:00:24 nbsp Do NOT support this location.  The owner of the store yells derogatory terms at women, and allows the staff to make homophobic remarks to their guests.  The food is Mediocre at best, and not even close to the quality of the store in sacramento.  all in all, its like most of the restaurants that have opened in the past in this location.  Poor customer service, coupled with bad food, bad pricing, loud obnoxious atmosphere, and unintelligent sexist staff.  Thumbs down.

DO NOT listen to only one commenter. Ive eaten here plenty of times, have a registered account and highly suspect the last two comments as disgruntled employees, competitors, or people who got drunk and kicked out. Users/ScottLay

I posted here back in July. I find it rude that you would just assume that im lying than maybe telling the truth. I never worked here, I dont own my own business seeing as im only 25 and a student and best of all I wasnt drunk or kicked out. I even spoke with an officer that night to discuss the incident. Dont you think if I was drunk I would of got a drunk in public?? Why would I go out of my day to explain how Homophobic and Horrible this place is? You think I had a fun time being mistreated... I came here to warn people of the possibility of being treated like me and that poor girl. Maybe you should open your eyes too. My family owns Kens Bike and Ski here in town, and coming from a family who also does business in davis, Tres hermanas is a disgrace. Food is ok, but not worth the trouble at night. I hope for the sake of davis,ca this place goes under or gets new ownership ASAP. Users/SarahClark88

Ms. Clark I am in complete agreement with you. The manager/owner and the team tres along with wait staff and table bussers are the rudest most out of control individuals there are in Davis. The Yolo DA and the court judges agree. This restaurant should have its club privileges revoked. I do not understand why the PD does not arrest the bouncers because they have clearly crossed the line. Wake up Davis PD, wake up Davis City Council, wake up Yolo County, if you let these neanderthals continue to behave they way they have for the last four years you are going to end up with far more problems than you did with the UC Davis football teams freeforall at University Village. Remember those days?

  I dont pretend to know the truth of what was said.  Ive only eaten here a couple of times and had reasonable experiences each time.  However, I note that these are not the first complaints about employee attitudes to appear on this page (e.g., a couple of commenters before these two most recent ones felt they were subject to racist treatment).

20140204 21:38:14 nbsp this place is pretty good and they have excellent horchata...since I am not a fan of very spicy food I probably will not go here again since most of their food is too spicy for me Users/monicalazur
