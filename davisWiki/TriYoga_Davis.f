TriYoga Davis specializes in TriYoga
Kali Ray TriYoga® is a systematic and complete hatha yoga method founded by yogini Kali Ray. The TriYoga flows embody the union of posture, breath and focusthat is asana, pranayama and mudra. The method is as gentle or as challenging as desired, in that the Flows are systematized by level. Students may progress from basics to advanced as they increase their flexibility, strength, endurance and knowledge of the method. Through sustained awareness on all aspects of the TriYoga Flows®, the inherent flow naturally emerges. This trinity practice is by the nature of its origin, deeply meditative and transformative. It feels good and it’s fun! You can learn more about TriYoga at their site. http://www.triyoga.com.

20100621 21:43:09 nbsp I greatly enjoy these classes. The yoga teachers really help each student, no matter the level of the student. The philosophy heavily emphasizes listening to the wisdom of your own body as to how far you go into the poses and flows. Class time goes by extremely quickly! I encourage anyone who is interested in yoga to start with these magnificent and skilled teachers. Users/CEMcG
