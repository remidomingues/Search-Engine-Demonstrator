Your review of the J Street apartments made my day. My friend and I are visiting Davis to look for homes for the fall quarter and I came across your review of the apartments after visiting them today and I couldnt stop laughing. The last bit was hilarious.

Thanks for being a pleasant person. Users/zer0cool
