About: A UC Berkeley UC Undergrad MisMarketing undergrad in Computer Science, with several friends in Davis, mainly Users/CindySperry, who counts as several friends. Once considered going to UC Davis because of all the trees and other green things. (Like Bike Signal bike signals and Ducks ducks and stagnant Putah Creek.)
