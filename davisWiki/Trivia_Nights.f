There are a number of trivia nights in and around Davis, sometimes there is a fee to get in and you can win a cash pot. Usually the grand prize is a gift certificate, round of drinks or something similar. Other prizes range from random pieces of junk to legitimately interesting artifacts. The California Aggie recently featured local pub quizzes in a Miles Duncan article titled Passing the Bar Exam.

Youll be given an answer sheet. Its a good idea to bring pens and scratch paper for each player. Using cell phones while participating in trivia is considered cheating no matter your intent. If you whip out a phone or make inappropriate use of the restroom facilities, you run the risk of being tarred and feathered by competing teams.

Trivia Master (Mistress?) Julia is known among attendees for her cheeky sarcasm and abundant charisma, and really makes this a fun place to be. the questions vary in difficulty from round to round and week to week, with 2 audio rounds and a visual round every week. Prizes are awarded to the top three teams, ranging from $15$25 bar tabs that are good for one week after winning.

Mondays. 7pm9pm. The de Veres Irish Pub Pub Quiz is hosted by popular quizmaster, Dr. Andy Jones, formerly of Bistro 33. Trivia contestants are faced with 30 questions on a variety of topics, including history, literature, current events, and pop culture, including movies, television and music. Play is broken up into several rounds, with a considerable amount of time given to come up with answers. Most of the questions are of medium to hard difficulty; nevertheless, almost every team scores in double digits. There is an intermission after the first 15 questions. The maximum number of players per team is six unless you want to audit (which is encouraged but kiss your chance at a prize goodbye). The prizes for the first through fourth place teams are de Veres gift cards in the denominations of $50, $25, and $15, and then some swag. For more information and sample questions, subscribe to the weekly newsletter or view the blog at http://www.yourquizmaster.com YourQuizmaster.Com.

On trivia night, happy hour specials are available until 7pm instead of 6:30. Therefore, if you arrive early, you can get some nice deals.

Wednesdays. Hosted by Preacher. More laid back than some of the other quizmasters, Preacher is a fun dude who will award points at random for anything he finds amusing. Part of the quiz is somewhat easier to appeal to casual players, while another part is more difficult for the hardcore trivia buffs. Apparently there is also a visual/video section which sounds pretty interesting.

Wednesdays, time recently changed to 8 PM. All ages are invited. Happy hour starts near the end, so you can get discounted drinks and appetizers! The pace is relatively brisk, a little more than a minute per question. It is against the rules to have questions repeated, but while the quizmaster is speaking the text is projected on two of the walls, which helps a lot if you have poor listening skills. You can have as many team members as you want, but you will be struck with increasing point handicaps for any more than 6, though you can have 2 teams at tables nearby as long as youre not sharing answers.

Every weeks trivia quiz has a theme.. recent themes have been things such as Time Travel, The Ocean, and Superheroes.  About a third of the questions are related to the theme and the rest can be about anything, usually on many different topics such as sports, history, art, pop culture, etc..

Prizes are usually given out for first (which is usually a $4050 gift certificate), second, and third place; there is a 4th prize (usually a bottle of liquor or wine) for a special prize round, which is a top 10 list type miniquiz given during the break in the middle of the quiz.

There are a couple drink specials available to trivia participants, and at least one appetizer special as well.  And then Happy Hour starts towards the end of the quiz at 9, with many cheap appetizers and $3 beers/shots, $4 Long Islands, Tokyo Teas, and AMFs, among other drink specials (full Happy Hour menu: http://ketmoree.com/menu/happy_menu.pdf)

Tuesdays :: 10pm (MarOct) / 9pm (NovFeb) :: 21+. 1 drink minimum to participate. 2 drinks per listed team member will get you a 3 point bonus and qualify you for a bonus prize. Drink stamping starts 1 hour before start time. Teams can have up to 6 members, with 3 points deducted in increasing increments of 3 for each member beyond the 6 person limit (ex: 3 for the 1st + 6 for the 2nd  9 for an 8 person team). There are two rounds, each with 20 questions and combined for a total score. The prizes are as follows:
  1st Place: $12 gift card awarded to each team member. If a winning player reuses a previous card, theres a $2 bonus credit.
  2nd Place: $9 gift card awarded to each team member. If a winning player reuses a previous card, theres a $1 bonus credit.
  3rd Place: $6 gift card awarded to each team member. If a winning player reuses a previous card, theres a $1 bonus credit.
  Median Score: To reward mediocrity (and to ensure that every team has something to play for), Sophias gives out one $12 gift card or a bottle of wine to the team with the median score.
  3rd Lowest Score: Choice of one $12 gift card or a bottle of wine.
  Highest Score, Round 2: Choice of one $12 gift card or a bottle of wine. (Teams that place in the top 3 and median are excluded.)
  Best Team Name: A round of shots. (Teams that place in the top 3 and median are excluded.)
  Tiebreaker: The team that guesses closest to the tiebreaker answer that does not win the median or place in the top 3 gets a choice of one $12 gift card or a bottle of wine. This is regardless of score, so its still possible for a team to walk away with something even if theyre getting their asses kicked. The tiebreaker question usually involves a numerical quantity that is impossible to know exactly. (ex: what is the female population of Madagascar ages 1534? or What is the distance to the moon in furlongs)

Other known prizes have been given out for the most incorrect answer, funniest answer, and last place. Occasionally they will award bottles of wine or gift certificates to randomly selected Facebook checkins and/or Twitter mentions.

The bar keeps track of drinks purchased with a team drink card which gets stamped for every item purchased. Keep in mind that food and drink purchases before 8:00 do not count toward the drink minimum (though the bartenders can be lenient on stamping if youve tipped them well). One stamp per member qualifies the team for grading and a prize. Teams can get three bonus points if each member buys two drinks. It is very difficult to place 1st, 2nd, or 3rd without earning the three bonus drink points.

Sophias limits Trivia Night to 40 teams. During the Spring and Summer, this limit is reached almost every week by 9:30, the time when the answer sheets are handed out. Hence, even though the actual event doesnt start until 10:00, teams need to secure a spot much earlier. To get chairs/stools/tables, one must arrive around 8:30. To ensure you get an answer sheet, get there around 9:15. In most cases, you will not be able to participate if you arrive at 9:55. There is a No ChairHording policy where only one empty chair per present person can be saved before the event begins. This prevents one person from unfairly saving 5 chairs for his/her team while people who are present stand helplessly (if its annoying in movie theaters, its going to be annoying at Trivia Night.) Paying customers are also given priority for tables over nonpaying customers, so a team saving a table that has not purchased an item risks forfeiting their table to people/teams who have purchased items.

Launched in 2005, Sophias was the first bar to launch a trivia event in Davis. It is generally considered the most difficult of all the trivia events in town and moves at the fastest pace. Nevertheless, the event still attracts a balanced mix of undergrads, graduate students, and young working professionals. There are many teams that can be consistently found week after week duking it out, most of which are comprised of graduate students from various departments around UCD. Canadian Softwood, a team from the Agricultural and Resource Economics agricultural and resource economics department, holds the record for most 1st Place finishes in a row (4). Regular competitors and winners include teams representing the Psychology psychology, Philosophy philosophy, Department of Nutrition nutrition and Mathematics mathematics (aka Mathletes The Mathletes) departments, as well as the School of law law, Graduate School of Management business, and School of Veterinary Medicine vetmed schools. An undergraduate team, The Backdoor Babes (Their name changes weekly), have staked out the back porch weekly since February 2008, and rarely walk away without placing in the top 3.

Unless ill, on vacation, or trapped under something heavy, the evening is usually hosted by Users/KevinWan Kevin, who also writes the questions, grades the answer sheets, and makes fun of peoples answers. His mother is a popular subject during trivia, both in team names and in answers. There is an inverse relationship between the accuracy of his grading and how much whiskey hes consumed.

There is a Sophias Trivia Night Categories list of common categories used in Sophias Trivia Night.

 Woodstocks Pizza 
See also Woodstocks Pizza.

Starting in February 2009, Woodstocks has been holding a weekly Trivia Night on Thursdays. The event is free to play and starts at 9:00pm, and while signup is encouraged at 8:158:30, the reality is that you just need to physically be seated at a table in the barside of the restaurant (or even at the bar itself) or the upstairs section above the kitchen by 9:00 to take part(though latecomers can still join in). The MCs do their best to accommodate as many players as possible, and you will only be turned away if there is truly NOWHERE left to sit or stand in the whole room (along with consideration of maximum occupancy for fire codes!).

Questions are separated into 4 themed rounds (themes change from week to week, and are sometimes based on current events and relevant topics; i.e., a round about Ireland around St. Pattys Day or a round about basketball at the beginning of March Madness). Questions are considered to be slightly easier than at some of the other Trivia Nights, particularly at Sophias, which may disappoint those who are hoping for a huge intellectual challenge but may be welcome to those who like the feeling of getting a majority of the questions right; this isnt to say that the questions arent at all challenging, but they are aimed more at the Davis locals and undergrads, rather than at the grad student crowd.

Like all Woodstocks events, Trivia Night is all ages. Obviously you have to be of age to buy beer, but even the freshman are welcome to come play and enjoy some pizza  so no complaining that there is nothing to do in Davis if youre under 21! Prizes range from free slices for winning one of the themed rounds, to Woodstocks shirts or gift certificates for winning the whole game. Other prizes for an overall winner have included: pint glasses (with beer company logos), liter glasses (with Woodstocks logo), movie passes for local theaters, and occasionally gift certificates to other downtown businesses.

The MCs, Mick and Thomas, are known to be friendly and fun during the event, often joking around with each other and the audience. Bonus point are sometimes awarded for particularly funny wrong answers, but more likely your clever guess will be shared with the audience for the enjoyment of all. There are ~1015 minute breaks between rounds while they count up answers, during which they play upbeat music (which usually relates somehow to the previous round) and give you a chance to buy some beer, use the bathroom, smoke a cigarette, make a phone call...or whatever else you might need to do. The event is usually over by 11:00pm (11:30 at the absolute latest), giving you the opportunity to capitalize on the rest of your Thursday night downtown (Woodstocks is located within 2 blocks of almost every other bar in Davis). For a 23 hour committment and no monetary committment (you arent pressured into buying a round of drinks for extra points), you can enjoy a fun event in a bar full of people and, if youre 21(or under 21 if you wanna play upstairs), have a great place to pregame for your night out at the bars.

 Streets Of London Pub 
See also Streets of London Pub.

Streets of London is not in Davis. They have two locations, one in West Sac and one in Sac. Trivia nights are Sunday Night. Questions have a British slant and random prizes given through out the night for best team name and worst score.  First prize is something good, but the other prizes are random things such as Bmovies on DVD and British amateur porn.

  Spotlight on Sophias in the Sacramento Business Journal: http://sacramento.bizjournals.com/sacramento/stories/2008/06/23/focus3.html?jsts_cn_hl Not So Trivial Pursuits


20070128 15:02:34 nbsp Sophias trivia has all sorts of nontrivia ways of getting points. There is a myspace question that you can only get with a myspace account and being friends with Sophias. Also if your entire team orders a second round of drinks, you get an extra 3 points. I totally agree with the one drink minimum, people who sit in a bar for two hours but dont even order a coke are lame, lame, lame. But I hate the second drink thing, two beers on a tuesday night is getting into sketchy territory for those with 8 am classes and its a slippery slop of trivia being about things other than trivia.  Users/AmyGoogenspa
  Theyve also added a welcome new policy about chair hoarding. You can have a maximum of 2 empty seats at a table, which is still pretty generous for such a busy night. Also, to expand Amys comment, theyve been totally cool with you ordering nonalcoholic drinks for that 2nd (or 1st) round. Just remember to tipping tip. Users/CraigBrozinsky

20070130 19:02:07 nbsp Yeah, I just feel so lame. Im going to feel even lamer next week when I have to buy TWO nonalcoholic drinks so my team doesnt lose on account of my cheapness.  Users/AmyGoogenspa

20070311 10:48:33 nbsp do any of these let under21s participate at all? Users/AllisonEriksen
  Sophias cards at the door, so not them. Potentially Bistro, but doubtfully streets of london because they are primarily a bar. Users/CraigBrozinsky

20070315 16:05:11 nbsp Just went to Sophias trivia for the first time last Tuesday after being a longtime Bistro 33 player. I have to say, Sophias trivia night is far, far better. There are more teams (a lot more), its rowdy, but strange as it sounds, it seems more intimate. I attribute that to the fact that Sophias feels more like a Pub Quiz than Bistro does. Youre in a bar, you can get to the actual bar, people are actually drinking and talking while theyre playing. It feels more like a group activity. At Bistro, the event takes place in a back room which makes the whole thing feel more like a classroom than a bar (especially with all the A/V stuff going on). Sophias quiz is definitely way more challenging, but in a good way I guess (in that you should know the answer and feel like an idiot once you hear it.) Bistros questions are either really easy (especially the true/false questions) or stupidly impossible. The respective hosts are a stark contrast. The Quiz Mistress at Bistro is definitely more showy and polished, but she can often be obnoxious. Sophias Users/KevinWan Quiz Master (who Im told is the owner, but Im not sure if thats true.) is less polished and a lot drier, but hes funny and has an ironic, selfdepricating hosting style. When the crowd heckles him (which happened several times last Tuesday), he talks shit back, which I find pretty funny. At Bistro, she seems to get agitated when people complain. Lighten up Sarah! As for the drink minimum at Sophias, I think its legit on their part. That they dont give drink stamps for food is bullshit in my opinion, but other than that, I bought 2 Bud Lights which cost me $6.50 (+$2 tipping tip). The way I see it, its cheaper than a movie and more interactive. Users/BriannaBetancourt

20070515 13:31:22 nbsp Bistro 33 recently moved the quiz from the function room to the main bar area. Whilst I can understand their reasons for doing so (less staff needed to serve drinks) I think it is not so much fun as before. Now you can spend the evening sharing the room with people who arent there for the quiz, and you dont get to really see everyone around you (depending on where you are sitting). For the last two weeks there have been no powerpoints either (presumably because of the NBA playoff games being on). Im still coming to terms with this change, but I think it is a change for the worse. And they seem to have stopped the pub quiz drinks and food promotions too. Users/KeithBradnam

20080316 nbsp
Im curious about the Thursday trivia night at the Silo Pub. Ive seen several posters and its mentioned even on their website, I would love it if someone can share their experience.
 Users/scrizer

20080601 07:58:59 nbsp Gosh, I didnt realize trivia nights in St. Louis were quite so big (or involved free beer, for that matter). I used to do some there back in the day but thought they were relatively isolated (or only as common as anywhere else). Ill have to hit up some trivia when Im back that way.
