VI. EDUCATIONAL SERVICES

b. ESTABLISHING A TRUANCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Discussion Item

Requested Action
Receive report about establishing a Truancy Management System

Rationale
Establishing a Truancy Management system has taken a strong step forward with the Davis Police Department and the Yolo County District Attorney District Attorney moving their support to abating truancy at all grade levels.  The pilot truancy sweeps of last school year proved effective enough to inspire the Department to offer daily support when they see a schoolage young person on the streets, and monthly support in the forms of sweeps for the 20 high school student and 15 junior high students chosen by school site staff as the most serious offenders.  They assert that every elementary level truancy problem will be addressed by the PD and pursued as necessary by the DAs office via Jonathan Raven. (New DA Jeff Reisig has directed staff to coordinate efforts with each school district.) After an encouraging meeting with DPD, whose initiative has been most supportive, final details of the exact procedure are being finalized in advance of the first sweep on September 19.
