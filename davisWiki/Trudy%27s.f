Trudys is a Convenience Stores convenience store, part of the Tercero Dining Commons structure, in which you will find drinks, snacks, smoothies, candy, and other convenience store items, including sex condoms.

You can pay for items via cash, meal swipes (e.g. one swipe for three candy bars), or credit/debit cards.

Its a good place to go if you are too lazy to go off campus or is impractical to go off campus (such as freshmen), but a bad place to go if you actually have a car and can go to Save Mart, Safeway, or even Rite Aid or AM/PM  just about anywhere is better in terms of prices, although far less convenient.  Also note they charge sales tax on commercially packaged food items, so add a 7% mark up in addition to the Trudy mark up.

Trudys sister convenience stores are The Junction at Segundo and Crossroads at the Cuarto DC.

A small store (also called Trudys back then) that served sandwiches used to be located inside the DC where the computer lab is now, before the current Trudys building was built.





20080521 21:56:04 nbsp A COMMENT ABOUT TRUDYS SINCE IT LACKS A COMMENT BOX:
TRUDYS IS A FUCKING SHITHOLE.
EVERYTIME I GO THERE, I COME BACK MORE DEPRESSED AND IT DRAINS MY SOUL OF WHAT LITTLE JOY AND HAPPINESS MY INSANE CLASSES BRING ME.
Only ONE of the employees there is actually exceptional, all of the others are rude and/or utterly incompetent. Then again, anyone who willingly chooses to work at an establishment like trudys would probably intolerable to begin with. They have the worst vegetarian options IF ANY. Dont even get me started on their price markup.
If Trudys actually tried to appreciate their customers and provide a service that was genuinely interested in the well being of the students maybe I would change my opinion.
As for now and the foreseeable future, it doesnt seem like there is any chance of that happening. Users/triscuitqueen
