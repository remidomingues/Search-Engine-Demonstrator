True West was one of the most charismatic bands helping define the 80s Paisley Underground scene. Gaining cult status even in such rocknroll bastions as Italy and Greece, True West was a Davis band formed from the rubble of The Suspects. True West lead singer/songwriter/guitarist, Russ Tolman, and guitarist Gavin Blair formed True West in 1981, while Steve Wynn and Kendra Smith went on to form the Dream Syndicate. Both bands played psychedelic, guitarrock ala Paisley Underground. Touring with the band until 1986, Tolman moved on to international waters, releasing an assortment of albums before creating Totem Poles and Glory Holes.
