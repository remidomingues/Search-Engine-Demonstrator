Trumpet vine (Campsis spp.) is deciduous climber native to the southeastern area of North America, but is such a hardy vine that it grows in most parts of the continent; C. grandiflora is the species youre most likely to see around town, because its a bit less invasive than C. radicans. From late spring through fall in Davis, the plant sports hundreds of large trumpetshaped orange blooms that attract both hummingbirds and ants. Trumpet vine is woody and attaches to surfaces with suckers similar to those found on ivy plants. During the winter months, the vine loses its leaves and just looks like a jumbled mass of dead twigs; sometime during late spring, it begins showing green sprouts. New growth sprouts from old vine, dont prune away any deadwood unless you dont want new growth in the spring! Trumpet vines are fast growing and over time develop a gnarled woody trunk resembling a grape vine; the vines can easily be trained around trees, along fences or on walls. Because the plant sends out new shoots fairly readily, its easily propagated, so you can share the fun with your neighbor or friends. Trumpet vines can put up with a good amount of shade during our weather Davis summers, but is truly a sunlover if you hope to see many flowers.
