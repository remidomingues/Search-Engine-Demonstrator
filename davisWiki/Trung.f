20120301 14:20:13 nbsp TrungIm putting some information back in the B Street Apartments. The reviews DO INDEED mention black mold. Users/PeterBoulay

20130320 11:56:07 nbsp Hey, why did you remove the word friendly from Dr. Dennis Guerrieri, Optometrist?  It would seem that most people view him as friendly; it is probably the most common description. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20130320 12:27:47 nbsp I did. I believe the point of a wiki is about information and the word friendly is too subjective especially when it comes to a service provider. There are reviews on other websites stating the opposite of Dr. Guerrieri. It seems more like an advertisement and doesnt provide wiki readers anything they cant already get from the comment section. It should stay in the comment section. Users/Trung
  There is no special comment section  the comment bar is only there to make it easier for people to edit, but people are free to edit any part of the page.  The wiki strives to reflect community perspectives, not some dry, flavorless facts.  If most commenters say hes friendly, then it seems reasonable to say that right up front.   Users/CovertProfessor

20130320 15:04:10 nbsp You say, I believe the point of a wiki is about information.   You seem to be making the common mistake of confusing an encyclopedia with a wiki, likely because of Wikipedia.  Wikipedia (which is a wiki based encyclopedia) is neutral and does not have primary sources because it is an encyclopedia, not because it is a wiki.  Wikis can have poems and odes to fountains, or shrines to loved pets long departed.  This is a community wiki, not an encyclopedia.  As such, community subjectivity is not removed by force, nor is there a demand for citations, nor a requirement that content not be original research, and admins do not make final decisions on content.  Davis Wiki is a wiki that celebrates Davis, and is specifically aimed at collecting the little, enjoyable things about town... a metric that is, itself, very subjective. Users/JabberWokky
