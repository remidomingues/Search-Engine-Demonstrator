Tryte is Octavio F. Genera, Jose Antonio Cruz, Matthew Hagerty, and Mike Hagerty.  They have a http://www.tryte.com website, with a ton of pictures and so forth.  (Someone into them should add more about them so we have more than just opinions)

CM Caskey of The California Aggie sheds http://californiaaggie.ucdavis.edu/article/?id6295 some light on why some people dont like Tryte, Is Tryte the official band of the UC Davis sorority system? Tonight they bring their shredtastic college rock to Davis Music Scene DMS in order to please the hordes of young women with Greek letters on their sweatshirts. Those who miss the straightup bluegrass of the Mad Cow String Band might actually confuse the Coffee House CoHo for Thursday nights at the Cantina del Cabo Cantina.


 Opinions on Tryte 
This band fucking rocks. Very clean solid sound....good soulful jams...amazing lead guitarist...passionate vocals...good grooves all around...  Users/MikeKayton

This band may be good musicians but for the most part they suck. They cant even spell. Whatever happened to bromusic having testosterone? Anyways... besides Some Assholes, Tryte has the most honest band name in Davis. This band is the local favorite for sorority sluts to suck dick to. If you like Dave Mathews Band, but hate the blackness of it all, then you will like Tryte.  Users/RobRoy

The best comparason i have heard to tryte is a bad combination of the goo goo dolls and santana.  Users/AlexEley

Saw these guys at The Graduate the Grad during a battle of the bands not too long ago. Worst performance Ive seen in a long time, considering these guys are supposed to be the best and brightest of the Davis scene... dark days indeed. Worst ten bucks I ever spent on cover.  Users/KenNeville

Probably one of the worst local bands Ive seen/heard live in Davis. Too generic for me. Kind of like how Weezer is now.  Users/YawenChen

If watching Octavio sob his way through a hamfisted acoustic version of Foo Fighters  Everlong at a STEP 2001 talent show is any indication of this band, dear God save us all. Sales of nehrucollared motorcycle jackets and hair gel will skyrocket if these guys ever get popular.

Id like to hear some samples of their music, especially this shredtastic stuff quoted above.  Chances are, it really isnt shred.  Users/StephenHo

I am not a Tryte fan at all.  They often seem to play before bands I DO like at G. St. pub, so I have heard them several times, and they just dont float my boat in any way, shape, or form.  In any case, theyre playing this coming Friday 12/16/05 at G St. at 10pm or so (before a band I do like... go figure).  Users/AlexPomeranz

These guys played at my birthday in 03.  Cool cats, great sound.  My best birthday ever.  Users/RyanKowdley
