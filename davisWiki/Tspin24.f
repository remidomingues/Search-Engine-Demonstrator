20071201 16:44:32 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. Were you aware that there is a wiki:westsac:Front Page West Sacramento wiki? You can create a page for wiki:westsac:SplashHound USA there and link to it from here using an interwiki link ({{{wiki:westsac:SplashHound USA}}}) or an interwiki redirect {{{(#redirect wiki:westsac:SplashHound USA}}}).

20071201 17:19:04 nbsp No need for all the entries... the single entry will show up in searches for all the same terms on both Google and the wiki search.  In fact, Google will actually lower your search score if you have duplicate identical pages all over the place.  On the other hand, you probably want to create links to the entry from appropriate entries like Dogs.   Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
