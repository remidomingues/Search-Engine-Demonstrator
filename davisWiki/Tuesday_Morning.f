20081206 18:38:17 nbsp I have been to tuesday morning on several different trips. Its great for pet supplies. You can get sturdy dog and cat toys for under 8 dollars and a nice leash for about  5 dollars. They have a nice selection of kitchen items as well. They always have sales so keep an eye out.
