Tule Lake Internment Camp was a location of Japanese internment during World War II. Over 1000 people of Japanese descent were rounded up from the Davis area and forcefully transferred to the camp in the extreme northeastern corner of California. In addition to the thousands from northern California, prisoners were also taken from Oregon and western Washington. The total population of the camp peaked at 18,700 prisoners, making it the largest American concentration camp of the era.
