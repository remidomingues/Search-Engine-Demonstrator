Like most college campuses, Campus UC Davis has various underground passages connecting buildings, providing utility access, and for other reasons.

   Between Sproul Hall and Olson Hall (see no toad sexing in Davis)
   Between Roessler Hall and Physics and Geology
   Between Wellman Hall and Kerr Hall
   Between Lower Freeborn and the MU
   From the bottom part of the MUGA to the bookstore loading dock is a tunnel
     Isnt that just a corridor?
   All the parts of the Chemistry building are connected underground

(Please add any more tunnels you may know about!)

Steam Tunnels
Steam is an awesome way to keep buildings heated over a large area, requiring pipes to carry such steam. Usually, there would be tunnels to allow access to these pipes for maintaining them. However, in the case of Davis, there are small access points to the system (visible by the steam rising from them in the morning), but there are no actual tunnels. This was highly disappointing.

20091110 18:50:27 nbsp I had to work in the basement of Sproul a few times and it was creepy as hell. I attempted to venture into the hallway that lead to Olson, but the sounds of the elevator and dripping water was too much. I think I have a video somewhere. Users/hankim
