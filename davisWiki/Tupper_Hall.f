Image(south_side_tupper.JPG, The south side of the building, 300, left, thumbnail) Tupper Hall is in the Health Sciences Complex on the south west end of campus, in the Vet/Med complex.  Tupper Hall houses mostly for students, staff, and faculty, as well as several departments, of both the School of Medicine and the School of Veterinary Medicine. The Center for Vectorborne Diseases also finds a lot of housing in this building.

The building has four floors with restricted access to almost all rooms inside the building.  The first floor or basement is filled with instructional laboratories for the School of Medicine, research laboratories, faculty offices, and one department office.The main floor or 2nd floor has lecture halls, classrooms, research labs, faculty offices. The 3nd through 4th floors house a mixture of offices and more research and possibly instructional laboratories.  The building has a ridiculous number of elevators scattered throughout it.  A large part of the western part of the building, (including the basement, 2nd, and 3rd floor) houses research animals.  You can find all sorts of critters ranging from fish, parrots, cats, dogs, rats, guinea pigs, chickens, roosters, lizards, snakes, frogs, and more. They are cared for round the clock, and there are techs hired through the Vet School, as well as veterinarians, to appropriately handle all animals. There is also a lot of protocols and committees to get to to work with any, as well as lots of ethics concerns and protocol requirements for safety and to remain humane.   Research dogs and cats, as well as other animals, are often adopted out through humane (noneuthanizing) shelter programs after a period of rehabitatalition training and safety checks, if it is safe to do so.

The building is undergoing some changes as the School of Medicine finish its process of moving out.


Of interest is also the several potentially dangerous, but awesomely interesting labs.  Tupper Hall houses laboratories designated up to biosafety level 3. UC Davis http://wwwdateline.ucdavis.edu/121302/dl_biosafety.html has asked more than once for permission to build a facility to accommodate Biosafety Level 4 Laboratory level 4, but so far has been denied.
