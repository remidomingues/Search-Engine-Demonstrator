20090815 11:00:55 nbsp Hey, did the phones disappear?  If so, it would be nice to have the listings there in a Former Phones section, both for historys sake and so people know they have been removed and its not just that nobody added them to the wiki.  wiki:gnome:Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20120818 18:57:28 nbsp Hey TurboCat, on the Davis Airporter page of the Wiki, it looks like the main link to my responses now leads to a fairly green page, by your hand, which is cool, but doesnt allow me to edit.  For instance, Ive been at the Airporter for fifteen years, but the green section says ten years, and I cant change it.  I can change it on the main wiki page, but when someone wants to see my big main entry, they click where it says click here. Who wouldnt?  Which leads them to the green page that says Ive been there for ten years.  Also, I actually like my responses laid out like that, but since the question/complaint of the customer is removed, my answer reads out of context.  Which wouldnt be such a big deal, except for the fact that its now the main link to my answers (refer to the longwinded entry from AirporterDriverPete, who has worked there for fifteen years. Its in the 20052007 sectionâ€” see link http://daviswiki.org/Davis_Airporter?actiondiff&version226&version124 here)  I see what the green vs/yellow is trying to do, but as long as it says see link HERE, leading to the green page, people will have no idea what the original comment/complaint was.  Sorry if my explanation is inadequate.  To put it short, how about a separate link to my response section?  One that shows the edits, one that does not.  Let me know if Im unclear, Ive a feeling I am.  Well, for starters, go to http://daviswiki.org/Davis_Airporter and look for see link http://daviswiki.org/Davis_Airporter?actiondiff&version226&version124 here  (and click on it).  And advise.   Thanks, Users/AirporterDriverPete
