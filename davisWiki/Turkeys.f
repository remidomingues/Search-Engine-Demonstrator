Wild turkeys and pheasants can be found in riparian and other uncultivated areas. Locally, Branigans Turkey Farm in Woodland has been farm raising domestic turkeys since 1942. Former President wiki:WikiPedia:Ronald_Reagan Ronald Reagan used to get his holiday birds from Branigans.

In the fall of 2007 a http://media.www.californiaaggie.com/media/storage/paper981/news/2007/10/19/CityNews/Cemetery.Haunted.By.Wild.Turkey3043685.shtml relocation plan was announced for the turkeys. While no connection could be established between the http://eggheadblog.ucdavis.edu/?p747 turkeys and AlQaeda, it was decided to pay $750 per bird to relocate them rather than to go down to Davis Lumber and buy an axe.

In November 2011, some of Daviss turkeys http://www.davisenterprise.com/localnews/city/wildturkeysstillcalldavishome/ found themselves homeless when old Chiles Mansion Chiles barn they used as a base was torn down to make way for a new Chiles Ranch development of 108 homes.

 Pictures of Local Turkeys 











 I often walk in the area around the Davis Cemetery, and the wild turkeys seem to range most often in the region bounded by Pole Line Road Pole Line to the west, Regis Drive to the north, Mesquite Drive to the east, and East 8th St to the south (typically in the vacant field where the Wilbur Wildland Fire Transport fire crew trucks park).  The last time I saw them (in the cemetery in March 2007), I counted 9 of them.  I suspect they spend most of their time foraging in the field to the east of the Davis Cemetery Users/AlexPomeranz

20071019 14:54:33 nbsp Articles in the Aggie and Bee indicate the wild Turkeys are being eradicated from the Davis Cemetery and surrounding area.  I saw the turkeys a few weeks ago crossing Loyola.  They were beautiful and unexpected.  The article says, Though theyve never bitten or clawed anyone . . . , yet people feel threatened.  If we want the world sterilized of the unexpected which present no threats, where is the beauty?  Is it only on TV?  We as a people are becoming far too docile.  Once everything is sterile, well all be happy.  Except me, Ill remain cynical. Users/AlanMiller

20071021 22:21:35 nbsp As far as the turkeys around the Davis Cemetery, wouldnt it be a lot cheaper just to open the dog park again? Users/GrumpyoldGeek

20071119 09:50:03 nbsp I pass that vacant field commuting to work each day. The flock contains at least 30 birds, and they are generally in the field and the yards of the houses across the street just before 8am and around 3pm. They walk around on the roofs and cars of the people who live there, and I imagine if they are as messy as geese then I wouldnt be happy if I lived there. Its almost thanksgiving and you can walk right up to them. you could easily grab one... Users/mvd

20071121 12:11:19 nbsp I went there this weekend and the flock was still there. It was actually nice to know the Turkeys are still there. It just adds to the ambience. Users/CarlosOverstreet

20071122 17:41:24 nbsp They were still there yesterday morning.  I drove down Pole Line around 6:50 A.M. and there were at least 20 of them walking down the bike lane.  I told them they should run and hide.  Hopefully, they chose to heed my words and none ended up on anyones dinner table today! Users/CatLa

20071125 17:35:23 nbsp This afternoon there were maybe 20 turkeys on the roof of a house on East 8th right before L. The owner was standing in her front yard looking bemused and there were a few people gathered on the sidewalk... When I drove by again a half hour later, they were gone. I thought it was exciting and I would have stopped to stare if I hadnt been in a car.  Users/ElleWeber

20071220 14:45:45 nbsp I was shocked when I first moved to Davis, after I saw a group of three turkeys freely wandering down the side of Pole Line.  One of the most funny moments was seeing three turkeys (the same ones?) following the mailman as he made his route down 8th Street.  I know Ive heard of mailmen getting chased by dogs, but only in Davis do they get followed by turkeys! Users/hokusman

20080805 22:22:29 nbsp I saw at least 10 of them fly (yes fly!) into trees in the Cemetery park this evening. It was amazing. How else are we to learn that turkeys hang out in trees? Users/BrendanBoyle

20081102 21:37:14 nbsp last time i saw them there was at least 15 or 20 Users/ChrisWaterstraat

20091126 10:32:39 nbsp Can we catch and eat these birds?? Users/darla
  Youd need a state hunting license and an upland game stamp and it would have to be in season (DFG regs) and you would have to harvest it without using a projectile or otherwise disturbing the peace (both against city codes). And youre not going to catch them with your hands as they can run upwards of 30 mph (though I recommend trying as hilarity often ensues) Users/MikeyCrews
  Im sure no one will notice if one of the wild ones were to disappear. Users/hankim
   Hmm, you havent been in Davis very long, have you?  People like the wild turkeys.  They will notice.   Users/CovertProfessor
      Makes sense I guess if they paid $750 for each turkey. Alright then, no one will know who did it. Users/hankim
           From what I have heard, wild turkey tastes nothing like the stuff you get in the store.  The meat is stringy, tough and gamey. Unless you smoke the turkey for many hours it would not be good.  Not everyone likes the turkeys, I live near the flock and they are mostly an annoyance to me.  They crap in my yard (turkey crap is big) and they scare the bejezzes out of me when they run across my roof. Users/DagonJones
   Wild turkey breasts are actually really good to eat (IMHO) but the other parts are pretty tough and probably best used in stews or chili. The Davis turkeys live a relatively sheltered existence that probably isnt much different than a large free range farm (so a young one would probably be delicious). The main difference between wild turkeys and domestic turkeys is that domestic turkeys have been selectively bred to have massive breasts and drum sticks, so massive that domestic turkeys cant breed in the absence of artificial insemination. Also domestic turkeys are harvested after a year, whereas you dont know the age of the wild turkey prior to harvesting. Users/MikeyCrews

20100315 18:52:46 nbsp I saw a dead turkey alongside Covell past Wildhorse yesterday. I assume it was hit by a car. :( Users/DukeMcAdow

20101115 21:54:05 nbsp For the last few days I have seen a few wild turkeys wandering around my apartment complex at Orchard Park. I am, of course, assuming they are wild because this is probably the time of year when turkey farmers would want to keep their potential profits from running off wherever they want. I must say I was impressed by their (the turkeys) confidence as they  sauntered about, completely unaware or unconcerned about any dangers that may befall them.  Users/flo

20110101 13:23:36 nbsp They were walking around by the Pajaro condos today.   Users/RohiniJasavala

20110208 10:03:50 nbsp There were a group of 9 or 10 of them walking around J and Covell yesterday afternoon. Then they walked up the Covell overpass and were pursued by a cop car. Users/pvo

20110801 11:37:45 nbsp There are several hens and many more poults wondering around Solano Park Gardens, eating all our strawberries! Unfortunately, Ive heard they eat our snakes, who keep down the rodent population. Users/BrianNeal

20111223 12:30:06 nbsp Turkeys roaming the Davis Cemetery area are one of the most enchanting aspects of Davis.  I love them, and visitors Ive had are always quite taken by them.  I guess I would like if people would lay off the horn when coming upon them.  Every spring they hatch baby turkeys strangely most of the adults disappear afterward.  I would really like if someone could assure me that they are taken to another farm to roam free and happy.   Users/ActionFigureBarbie

20131212 12:37:09 nbsp There is a large flock that now roams the North Davis Greenbelts (330 birds), not sure if its an offshoot of the Davis Cemetery gang. Users/AlexMandel
