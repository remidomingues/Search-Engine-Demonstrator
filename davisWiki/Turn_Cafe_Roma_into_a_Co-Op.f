This page was made to discuss the future of the late Cafe Roma, and the communitys interest in maintaining the coffee shop while converting it into a cooperative venture.  Though Roma has since become 3rd & U Cafe, this page is maintained for historical reasons, and demonstrates one of the many ways the wiki can/has been used not only to document Davis, but to  create a dialog with the purpose of shaping and benefiting the Davis community as a whole.

Cafe Roma is closing at the end of February. If we get a bunch of people together to pool their money together we can start an organization to take over the lease.

The rent will be about $6,000 a month, but considering the location  that is reasonable. If we fix up the kitchen we could sell a lot more food items than it currently does. And if we get a beer/wine license well be golden.

A Facebook group entitled http://ucdavis.facebook.com/group.php?gid2245312451 Lets turn Cafe Roma into a CoOp Coffee Shop/Deli/Pub has been started to get a group together to pool money into taking over Cafe Roma and turning it into a Cooperative business venture.

Lets get going on this.

Another idea  start a nonprofit to run Roma. Less of a problem with donations, which can be made into an endowment. No shares to speak of so no worries about tracking owners, etc.



Here are some approaches:

 Buy the building 


Buying the building would probably be expensive, as I dont believe that you could buy just the Cafe and not the apartments above it. This would probably push the price into the millions.
  According to King Properties, the building is not for sale.

 Take over the lease 


The lease is currently $4,000+ and is going up. If wed like to start a CoOp, theres a pantsload of paperwork to be done, not to mention a sizable investment. I dont know how big this investment needs to be. There are organizations to help start coops, but I dont know what they are.

Note: The landlord may not care about who the tenant is; s/he may just want to maximize rent. Unless the owner is sympathetic (ie, will offer subsidized rent), Roma may be better off moving to a place that is either subsidized or cheaper at market rates. (With Romas reputation, you could move into someones garage...) Theres no reason to put out a lot of energy if rent is going to suck out our espressoflavored precious bodily fluids.

 Starting a Coop/Potential Partners 

As of now many businesses are interested in taking this over, but we need to keep the vibe alive.

A prominent manager at the CoHo has expressed interest in getting involved, as well as members of the ASUCD Govt. We can do this.

Perhaps we should plan a fundraising event for Feb 24th.

Wed want to be a California Cooperative Corporation, which seems to be in the state code http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgibin/waisgate?WAISdocID67979826316+5+0+0&WAISactionretrieve here and http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgibin/waisgate?WAISdocID67979826316+0+0+0&WAISactionretrieve here. Someone at the Davis Food Coop said that to be a CCC, each member can own no more than $300 in shares, though the price for an individual share can be anything from $1 to $300. The Davis Food Coop http://www.daviscoop.com/bylaws.htm Articles of Incorporation could provide a useful example. Also http://www.ncba.org/abcoop_howto.cfm How to start a cooperative from the National Cooperative Business Association.

This means we cannot have a member who makes an investment through shares beyond $300.  Essentially, the voting power and shares are capped to ensure that an individual with a large investment cannot have a greater say that any other member.

 Get the Davis Food Coop to take over the lease 
While cooperative businesses are a great idea, and can definitely workthe wiki:WikiPedia:Cheese_Board_Collective Cheese Board Collective in Berkeley is a particularly delicious exampleRoma will be closing at the end of February, and the landlord is likely to be eager to find a new tenant if (s)he hasnt already done so. Here are some reasons why Davis Food CoOp taking over the lease is a is a good idea:
  DFC has capital and could make a legitimate offer on the lease
  DFC has a business license and is an established, respected business in the City of Davis.
  Cafe Roma is dirty. DFC knows how to manage food service, knows HACCP, knows sanitation, etc.
  Cafe Romas food service is inconsistent and limited. DFC has established food service infrastructure.
  DFC is already a CoOp. While there are organizations (see above) that help to start coops, its still a time consuming process that isnt going to happen in two weeks.

The way Users/ArlenAbraham I Imagine this working is that the coffee shop would become a DFC enterprise, the same DFC membership benefits and structure would apply (5% discount, more for volunteer food service and cleaning people).

 Heres what needs to happen 
Im really not here this weekend, Im in Chico now (2007216) and Im moving farther away from civilization (wifi) tomorrow. A small group of dedicated people need to start meeting on this ASAP. Im eager to work on this, but I think people need to get things moving before I get back, even if its not this particular plan. Users/ArlenAbraham
 Whats the status on the lease 
First and foremost, we need to find out whats up with the lease. Has the landlord found a new tenant? Is the lease price fixed? If its open to bids, what kind of bid would we need to make to get the lease?
 Poke the DFC Board 
Informally ask if DFC would be at all interested in this, if theres no way in hell, then theres no reason to waste our time.
 Does this make sense financially? 
I dont know jack about GAP or how to run a business. Yes, we can sit down with DFC and work on these numbers, but we need to have at least some idea of what were talking about before we go to the board.
 Fundraising 
Cafe Roma is dirty. DFC isnt going to want to sink a couple grand into revamping the bathrooms and food service areas. The building could use more outlets, new chairs, repaired tables, etc. To make the offer more appealing, we could pool our financial resources to help with the renovation.


 Get local businesses to partner in project 
It is rumored that the owners of Ali Baba, Navins Copy Shop and OffCampus Books are each interested in taking over and keeping the place largely the same, with improvements. Perhaps a partnership between students, townies, and interested local businesses could preserve the community importance of Roma.

  I am personally willing to invest $1000 to make the initial purchase of the lease next week. My goal is $30,000. Rob has had the idea of having a fundraiser to suplement that effort. I am still working out the detials on accounts and such to get this ball rolling.
  I am all for it, especially actually buying some shares. Users/BenjaminRosenstein
  I would buy some shares for sure! Users/StevenDaubert

  I can put down 100 bucks and/or buy shares, lots of time, and help with painting, bleaching, building, and general cleaning of the place. Ive got bleach, paintbrushes and other random things we could use that would cut out a small fraction of the revamping costs. Users/JuliaRoseFurman
  I can put down a thousand, and might be able to pull some more, also lots of free time to make it work. ~DavePoole  Oh and paper work and accounting/legal stuff, I can get that done as well.
  Ill buy shares. Users/KenjiYamada
  Also I have much experiance in food service, including some in management positions, so I could help work the place once it opened. Users/BenjaminRosenstein

  I can put in money and write an article for any fundraiser that might happen. Call me: 5304066233 or email: jfernandez@dailydemocrat.com Users/JoshFernandez
  I can buy shares and help fundraise among faculty and staff. I can also help write and check a business plan, paperwork, etc, and I can help some with planning (financial and otherwise). Id also be happy to work the place once it opened. Dont have time (or expertise) to write an entire business plan, but Id be happy to work with others to get something reasonable together. Either a nonprofit or a coop sound like potentially viable options. It looks like we need a separate page with the steps that need to happen for each  http://www.ncba.org/abcoop_howto.cfm like this  and the status of each step, along with a meeting schedule. There should be regular meetings that can involve the wider community if people are serious.  Users/PhoebeAyers


This idea came about on St. Valentines day, after ASUCD senator Andrew Peake and Brent Laabs heard of the future fate of the Cafe Roma, totally awesome idea in my opinion. ~D

20070216 01:07:45 nbsp We need to set a target initial investment amount in order to know what the fundraiser goal is. Users/PaulAmnuaypayoat

20070216 01:15:21 nbsp $6,000 for rent + $1,000 for supplies and utilities, per month (Im guessing here) means that youd need to sell around 19 drinks an hour on average to break even, with two $8/hour workers factored in.  If the workers werent paid then itd be around 11 drinks an hour. Users/PhilipNeustrom
  Thats about a drink every 3 mins all day long. Read: you cant just sell coffee, especially if you want to be open 24hrs. Users/ArlenAbraham

20070216 01:31:16 nbsp As mentioned on the facebook group, selling shares may be a lucrative way to go as well.  Possibly even a combination of fundraising and shares? I believe the DFC has a membership option correct? Perhaps we should have the initial share buyers gain the perks of membership in for a year while giving donators, who contribute a little less, perks in the first few months of operation or something. This way we get people willing to formally help fund the estabilishment, while those who arent willing to make a major financial investment (The Facebook group said $72 a share with 250 people for the rent? I am sure I cant pay that much with my regular budget) will be allowed to make a smaller one at their leisure to help with the starting costs. Users/ChiakiHirai

20070216 02:01:19 nbsp As I said in the facebook group, Im down to make this into a coop, and eager to help. We need to find a time when all serious members can meet up and figure out what the next steps should be.  Users/JuliaRoseFurman

Ill be honest...I think the coop thing is a terrible idea.  Given the time constraints we have, I just dont see that happening.  What seems more likely is finding someone whos sympathetic to our needs as students/townspeople to take over the business...also someone whos competent and who actually takes the business seriously and makes employees actually be decent at the whole customer service thing.  Roma in its current state as a culture hub and concept is great, but considering that most of the time they refuse to sell you food and coffee service is slow and disgruntled, Id say that it needed change even if it wasnt going under.

It would be a great idea to do a volunteer coop cafe instead of a paid one.


I think that buying shares (between $100and $1000) with the expecation of a return on the investment can raise enough capital in a week. I do think there will be some changes in managment style, and that always leads to changes in service. The best part of this being a coop is that it will be much more responsive to consumers. I am personally willing to invest $1000 to make the initial purchase of the lease next week. My goal is $30,000. Rob has had the idea of having a fundraiser to suplement that effort. I am still working out the detials on accounts and such to get this ball rolling.

20070216 21:07:13 nbsp Perhaps if creating an entirely new coop sounds too complicated, we could help set up a small partnership of Ali Baba, Navins, OffCampus Books, and students, residents, and etc. Make it a very community oriented cafe, run by the community, as in the past style and feel.

20070217 03:25:54 nbsp sorry arlen but the DFC absolutely cannot take on something like that right now. the remodel is #1 priority right now and already involves a great deal of debt. we just had to say no to a bunch of west davis folks asking the coop to start a 2nd store at the former site of food faire/rays. youre welcome to bring it up to the general manager or others on the board, but i can guess what the response will be. id like to think it would be a possibility if not for the remodel upcoming. the DFC can still be a good resource though for knowhow and potentially even a grant or something, and many individuals involved with the DFC would likely be eager to support a coop coffeeshop. but in the context of the current dfc board, the remodel, and what just went down with west davis, its just in no way at all going to happen for them to take over the lease.

Sounds good.  I should come, since I did a lot of research within ASUCD on this, which has some positives and some negatives for the project.

20070219 16:08:08 nbsp Ive been hanging out at roma almost everyday for 3 years. I hope that the changes you all make dont negatively effect Romas ability to be a community gathering place. There is no other place in town where people from all walks of life are welcome and are able to comfortably intermingle and socialize. It is a really rare thing that can easily be ruined. Users/SolomonBothwell

The business name Cafe Amor has been registered for this and a paypal account to accept https://www.paypal.com/cgibin/webscr?cmd_xclick&businesspatheticalpanic%40gmail%2ecom&item_nameBeing%20Awesome&page_stylePrimary&no_shipping1&cnComments%20or%20suggestions%3f&tax0&currency_codeUSD&lcUS&bnPP%2dDonationsBF&charsetUTF%2d8 donations has been setup as well, if this plan falls through we will fully reimburse any donations sans fees which paypal takes (so checks for Cafe Amor would probably be a better way to help), in addition, we are working to set up a pledge system like CalPIRG has. ~DavePoole

20070223 00:42:42 nbsp Im rather skeptical on the nonprofit coffee house. Its a genuine idea, yes, but we need investors, and Im uneasy about the idea that people will be simply throwing money at the cafe without an actual return. Smaller donations may not be so much, but larger investments from local businesses or people who are willing to put down money for shares may become discouraged in this event.

Also, I really want some realistic figures on how much we need to start this all up. The CalPIRG idea sounds good, but people arent going to willingly donate money without knowing how much in total well need, and how much they each should contribute. Transparency will be a very good factor to have for those that are donating.Users/ChiakiHirai

20070223 09:31:26 nbsp This pretty much isnt going to happen in the next five days or so. If people are genuinely interested in starting a coop coffee shop in davis, I think its a great idea and you should join the email list MailTo(amor DASH cafe AT googlegroups DOT com).

20070228 I agree with Users/ChiakiHirai that a nonprofit coffee house, or even a coffee house operated by a nonprofit is an idea to treat with skepticism; food coops operated under the auspices of nonprofit corporations often have difficulties with capital and not having a consumer membership structure. I think that the idea of a worker cooperative has a lot more potential for a future Café Amor.
