In a Davis city whose focus seems to revolve around university life and for whose children University of California college attendance is an expectation, academic achievement is a big deal. To keep up with the Joneses in this town, youd better be pretty darn smart to begin with or learn to avail yourself of the many tutoring and test prep services out there. In a place full of International House international students and PhDs, theres got to be somebody who can help you master those math proofs! And if you just dont have the bucks to pay for a tutor, consider asking a friend to help school you.
