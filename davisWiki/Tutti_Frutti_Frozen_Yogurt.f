Tutti Frutti was a selfserve Frozen Yogurt yogurt shop.  It served various http://www.tffrozenyogurt.com/?midsub02_01 flavors, including Tutti Frutti.

They had a wide selection of flavors that rotated, with http://www.tffrozenyogurt.com/?midsub02_01 tart and http://www.tffrozenyogurt.com/?midsub02_02 creamy selections.  Some flavors included: Original, Vanilla, Chocolate, Strawberry, Pistachio, Banana Pudding, Cookies n Cream, Acai Berry, Guava, Passion Fruit, Green Apple, Orange Sorbet, and Tutti Frutti.  Their product contained live and active cultures and is certified Kosher by the Orthodox Union.

For those of you that were so excited about this shop opening up, but were disappointed by the original ownership, there was good news! Tutti Frutti Davis received new http://www.tuttifruttidavis.com/owners ownership! However, the store closed eventually.

Also exciting, Tutti Frutti TO GO brought frozen yogurt to events, parties, weddings, or other special occasions! Check out the historical flyer below!

Starting March 1, 2012 Tutti Frutti Davis is offering a $2 Kids cup, where youth under 18 years old can fill up a 6 oz. cup with all the frozen yogurt and toppings they want and just pay 2 bucks! (SundayThursday 710PM)

The store was located about ten strides from the North Davis Nugget.

20090901 00:54:55 nbsp This place just opened!  I happen to the know owner whos a very nice lady.
Located in Oak Tree Plaza next to  (left of) the Nugget (the north one).
Anyway, lots of selections with five separate stands, each serving two flavors!  I started with the original flavor  smooth, rich and tarty.  I also sampled (free) green tea, mango, and blueberry.  They were all very good and had a lot richer flavor than some of the other places Ive tried.  Id definitely go again :) Users/jobobo

20090903 17:47:02 nbsp Checked this place out today. I enjoy that they have such large cups, perfect for a froyo fanatic like me. As for the froyo, this place is definitely the best selfserve yogurt place in Davis with a good selection of ingredients.  Users/GregWebb

20090912 10:02:55 nbsp i love how many flavors this place has! i can never pick just one. also, they have almost as many fresh fruit toppings as regular toppings which i like and ive been there about four times now and the fruit has been ripe everytime! every other yogurt place i go to it seems like the fruit is hard and not quite ripe. they have a little less toppings than some other places which i also like, because i usually get overwhelmed and get half a cup of toppings haha. over all my new favorite yogurt shack in davis.

20090912 18:54:31 nbsp Move over Cultive! Davis is now equipped with tarty froyo store that serves by the ounces. Tutti Frutti yogurt is definitely my new favorite place. It has mostly the tarty fruit flavors with exception of chocolate and vanilla. Although I hope the green tea, mango or the peach (so I can compare with cultives version) would be in rotation but I absolutely love the pomegranate flavor that was available. Their passionfruit and kiwi tastes wonderful as well. I highly recommended this place to tarty yogurt lovers. I think its cheaper than Cultive because I got a TON yogurt and fruit toppings and it costs less than $4. In fact, my BF and I got two full cups for $7.01.

Location was a little tricky. Its right next to the Nugget on the left side near the entrance.  Users/KimN.

20090918 04:41:07 nbsp nice place, good location Users/kelvinkay

20090919 17:28:01 nbsp While taste is certainly subjective, and the first reviews differ from mine, Im going to admit not liking any of the flavors I tasted. I tried taro, plain, and my sons strawberry. All 3 seemed artificial, and the plain wasnt very tart. That may be a good thing to some palates. Users/NoelBruening

20091009 12:25:00 nbsp I like this place.  When I went they had a buy1get1free thing going on so my group of friends and I got a nice deal.  They have twice the variety of flavors compared to other froyo stores in Davis, which is nice.  Their toppings are the usual, but I like fruit flavored jellies that they have.   Users/BenLee

20100127 20:52:46 nbsp mmm yummy yogurt!! Users/victoriatu

20100227 21:03:22 nbsp I just finished eating my lychee and tutti frutti fro yo as we speak... Ive gone here about 10 times now, and I still love it!  The service is always very friendly, and the stamp cards are great.  Definitely try the cheesecake bites as one of your toppings... its ... so... gooooooood! Users/juicee

20100419 22:13:40 nbsp I have been to Yogurt Shack, Cultive, Yolo Berry, Sugar Plum...what am I missing?  Before I tried Tutti Frutti I was a huge Yolo Berry fan.  I especially loved Yolo Berry because its very close to my house. My only problem with Yolo Berry was that their yogurt is very soft and melts so quickly! I have found this to be a problem at Yogurt Shack and Sugar Plum as well.  So I recently tried Tutti Frutti and their yogurt is extra FROZEN and SOOOO much more refreshing! The flavors are the BEST real healthy yogurt that is delicious!  They have great toppings (including many fresh fruit options) but not so many that Im totally overwhelmed.  (Yolo Berry and Yogurt Shack have waaaay too many options for me.  I can never resist all the temptation and end up with a messy bowl of sugar, rockhard gummi candies, and runny chocolate  all of which inevitably leave me feeling like utter crap before I even finish...but maybe thats just me.)

Another plus Tutti Frutti has an extremely pleasant, CLEAN, cool, bright atmosphere.  The lady who works here (possibly the owner?) is really friendly and she keeps this place spotless (even the bathroom) and the tables are never sticky!

So, even though I live downtown, I will be going to Tutti Frutti from now on because their yogurt is THAT much better.  Highly recommended.                    Users/MishkaKJW

20100518 11:53:24 nbsp this is my suggestion. if you guys are almost out of DAVIS area, maybe lowering the price would be a good idea to have more ppl to come... Users/tahoeian

20100614 02:09:15 nbsp Once I was there and I saw they were out of the only flavor I wanted and I complained a bit to the person I was with... Just idly, I wasnt really upset.

Someone ran out of the back, tested the machine, and took off the out of service sign so I could get some of the flavor. Not sure if that was just coincidence, but I felt really bad xD The yogurt is good and priced fairly... The employees at the register can be a bit disdainful, but I go to yogurt shops for yogurt anyway, not conversation :3 Users/sundeimasu

20120326 21:40:42 nbsp I went here last night with my boyfriend and if they always have the praline yogurt, I will NEVER EVER go anywhere else. Literally the best frozen yogurt I have ever had, and the boyfriend and I eat a lot of froyo....sooooo good....sooooooooo good licks lips Users/CoriV

20121027 20:36:58 nbsp The soy yogurt here is definitely the best thing on the menu. 4 dairyeaters and 1 vegan agree that the vanilla soy yogurt is off the hook. It is natural tasting you can tell that it doesnt contain artificial flavors, and it is not too sweet. If you want to add sweetness, you can add any of the candy or fruit in the bar. I wish all of the flavors were vegan. they should be since the soy is clearly so much better tasting than the dairy options. I also feel like I can visit tutti frutti super often because i dont feel like i just ate something really unhealthy after i leave. In fact, I feel like I just a a delicious bowl of frozen cereal. I also wish the place opened earlier so i could go there for breakfast. Vanilla soy yogurt + raspberries, strawberries, blackberries and pecans is soooooo good! If they made a soy coffee flavored yogurt with real coffee i would probably die. To a coffee yogurt i would add shredded coconut, dark chocolate chips and almonds. Tuttui Frutti is definitely at least 1 million times better than yolo berry. Users/jimhu

20130711 10:11:06 nbsp daviswiki should add a random yogurt finder as it seems to now number in the double digit.  They run groupons here.  The groupon is kind of restrictive and I wouldnt recommend it.  Yogurt is very good however, I would recommend.  Users/shraken
