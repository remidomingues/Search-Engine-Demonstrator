Unfortunately, Davis has a fair number of methamphetamine addicts, commonly known as tweakers. They are one of the reasons it is always wise to lock up your Bicycling bike.

The term tweaker technically refers to a stage within the methamphetamine abuse cycle.  From the State of California Resource Center, publication No. (ADP) 992455 (http://www.stopdrugs.org/tweaking.html link):

  The most dangerous stage of meth abuse is called tweaking.  A tweaker is an abuser who probably has not slept in 315 days and is irritable and paranoid.  Tweakers often behave or react violently and if a tweaker is using alcohol or another depressant, negative feelings and associated dangers intensify.  The tweaker craves more meth, but no dosage will help recreate the euphoric high, causing frustration, unpredictability, and the potential for Tragic Events violence.

  A tweaker can appear normal: eyes can be clear, speech concise, and movements brisk.  But a closer look will reveal the persons eyes are moving ten times faster than normal, the voice has a slight quiver, and movements are quick and jerky.  Tweakers are often involved in domestic disputes and motor vehicle accidents.  They may hang out at raves and parties and participate in spurofthemoment Crime crimes, such as purse snatchings and assaults, to support their habit.

  Detaining a tweaker alone is not recommended and law enforcement officers should call for backup.

I spent some time sitting in my fair share of court rooms in Yolo County and lets just say that I heard the word methampetamine come up a lot.  Users/RobRoy

Oh, what demons these tweakers are!  In fact, sounds like an undercover cop  Users/ChristopherMckenzie

Some statistics: the Davis Police logs http://cityofdavis.org/police/log/press/ from 04/0109/27/2005 list three meth incidents. However, all three were reported during the past few days (09/2409/26), which seems unlikely. Maybe they drop reports from the online logs? RAND corporation seems to have very detailed stats about drug abuse http://ca.rand.org/stats/health/drug.html  does anyone have access? Users/JoFeuerstein

That log only has data for reports filed in the past week. Users/RyanCastellucci
