One of Davis Town Characters, TwoStep is a homeless man who hangs around the Taco Bell in South Davis and is more wellknown in the Davis Joint Unified School District local Davis schools than at UCD.  He is nicknamed TwoStep because when he walks, he generally takes two steps forward and one step backward, though sometimes instead of taking the second step forward, he will do a little shuffle.



 Is that the guy that always drinks with his buddies on the South Davis Bike Path every Friday afternoon? I see them every single week drinking Natty Ice among other things. Users/AbbyLawson

 Ive heard him speak. I once gave him some food after shopping at the South Davis Nugget a few years ago. We talked for a bit, but I cant for the life of me remember what we talked about, except that part of it had something to do with him doing leatherwork. He was really quite friendly, though.
