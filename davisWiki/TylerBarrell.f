Acclaimed author of the Universal Decay Role Playing Game rule set, Tyler Barrell frequents DRAGON to find new test subjects.  Tyler is a full time author, his books can be found http://daemoneye.net/ here.  He is always looking for people interested in trying his books on for size.

 GAME SYSTEMS 

 EDITION PI (aka 3.1415) (DnD variant) 
This system is a mix of the best/most playable parts of 3.0 and 3.5, with some balance tweaks (like nonsuck monks and a haste spell that WORKS), and a LOT of why wasnt this in the base books?.  Most noticeable are the additions of all the PCready races into the pi PHB, introduction of elemental wizards, and the full integration of a balanced and easy to play psionics system (which takes up only about 2030 pages, including magic item chapter in the pi DMG).

 EDITION PI BOOKS 
 Edition Pi Personal HowTo Book (pi PHB): The big book of how to make a character using the Edition pi rules.
 Edition Pi Dominant Magis Grimoire (pi DMG): A guidebook for DMs using the edition pi rules, containing DMspecific rules and reference material.
 Edition pi Minions and Monsters (pi MM)L: The tome of things that go bump in the night...or at any time, really.
 Can of Dragon Juice (Warning!  Do not cast spells or operate magical items when under the influence of this beverage): Despite its tongueincheek name (a hallmark of all the splatbooks for Edition pi) this is essentially the guidebook for arcane spellcasters.
 Can of Sacred Oil (Caution!  Contents under divine observation, defile at your own risk): This is the secondmost developed of the Can of series books, focusing on divine spellcasters.
 Can of Slimy Goodness (Warning!  Drinking this beverage may lead to a career in politics or law): This book adds extra options, and explores the subsystems of, characters that are on the sneaky and social side.  Mainly geared for rogues, it also can be used for socialoriented bards, sneakoriented rangers, and so on.
 Can of Whupass (Caution!  Contents under extreme pressure, point away from face when opening): This book is all about characters that kick ass, giving them more feat choices and even some nice progression paths.  One thing people seem to like are the no pain monks, at least in concept.

 UNIVERSAL DECAY (d20 variant) 
This system is a complete reworking of the 3.0/3.5 system, to the point where it is barely recognizable.  The entire system has been broken down, reshaped, and built back up into a MUCH more balanced and modular set of rules.  Despite all the changes this entails, it still takes only a few minutes to learn (partly BECAUSE the modular nature lets you mess around with only the things you want to mess around with).  Here are some highlights 
 Dead Stars Setting: Instead of a pseudomedieval fantasy world the core rule book incorporates a scifi setting with horror elements.  This is not such a big deal, it contains an entire chapter (and copious in other settings entries) for using the system wherever you might want to tread...or just rock on with your blasterwielding bugman.
 Character Creation: Instead of rolling dice for ability scores you prioritize what is most to least important to you in a character, with ability scores being just one aspect.  Want the highest ability scores?  Then you have to cope with averagetolousy ratings in other areas like skill points and starting cash.
 Durability: Your Hit Points equal your Constitution score...deal with it.  If you are LUCKY you can eek out a few more points from other sources, but no more 100+ HP fighter heat shields!
 Races: Each race has a list of skills that are ALWAYS class skills for members of that race.
 Classes: Each base class has only 10 levels, and prestige classes only 5.  Not all classes get a base attack bonus!
 Skills: The game is FAR more skillbased, with all types of skills fully integrated into the game.  Meatheaded warriors can still kick butt...but without any social skills they have a hard time buying decent gear!
 Combat: No more critical hits, instead the amount you pass the tohit roll by becomes a damage bonus!  Also armor ABSORBS damage (and gets messed up QUICK) instead of deflecting it, so you better get yourself sum o dat.  Finally the rules have a fully integrated (and optional of course) item creation system that allows you to play technogeek to get the best gear for the situation...instead of having to buy a separate book for a dozen more varieties of swords.
 Powers: Each type of special power has been seriously rethought and rewritten.  Magic uses the Spellcraft skill to ACTUALLY CRAFT SPELLS!  Psionics are now a mix of feats to access categories, and skill checks to USE them successfully.

 UNIVERSAL DECAY BOOKS 
 Dead Stars Rule Book: This is the main rule book in the Universal Decay system.  It includes the scifi/horror Dead Stars campaign setting, as well as a guide on adapting the book to OTHER campaigns.

 CAMPAIGNS 
Currently an Edition Pi Pirates game, GMed by Tristan Eifler, and a Dead Stars campaign run by Samuel Weber, both occurring at DRAGON on alternating weeks.

We are currently looking for a fourth player for Sunday afternoon gaming sessions; currently slated for game play are the UD Supers campaign, Cape and Hammer, and the modern day horror setting, The Shadows Move.
