Hello! My name is Tyler Griffith and I will be attended UC Davis starting in the fall quarter of 2014 for a Masters of Science in Forensic Science. I enjoy reading, listening (and singing terribly) to musicals, and drinking bottles of moscato.

This wiki has been extremely helpful in regards to looking at apartments, what life is like in Davis, and I feel much more prepared for the culture shock of moving out to California after living in Michigan my entire life.

Im looking at places to reside for my time there in graduate school (and possibly after?) for two years. If youre in the same program as me, share similar interests, or are finding places to live yourself, contact me and well stumble through finding stuff together!
