First I work? Then I pay? Then I have to eat fruit? Why was I ever born?   Homer Simpson

UPick (youpick) farms are farms where you pick the produce yourself. This allows you to choose the exact fruit/vegetable yourself, there is no damage in shipping, it can be picked when ripe, and it eliminates the farms labor costs thus food can be gotten for a small fraction of the normal store price. The only drawbacks are that you have to go to the farm (which may not have what you want or may not be open) and pick it yourself. Upick usually is for berries (i.e. blackberries, boysenberries, strawberries), but can also include tree fruit or nuts.

The area farms which are open to Upick are:
