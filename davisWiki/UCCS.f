20080726 19:46:18 nbsp I did this program last summer and it was horrible. The program is really bad at setting you up with internships and the internship coordinator, Erika Peters, is completely uninterested in helping you. The time I was there, she spent the entire time bringing her kid into work and ignoring the students who needed her help. If youre considering it, just do the Washington program. Its way better.
