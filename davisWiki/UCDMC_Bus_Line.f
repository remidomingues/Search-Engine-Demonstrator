It may be an alternative to Yolobus for some  its 2030 minutes into Sacramento vs. Yolobuss 60 minutes.

During rush hour in the morning and evening, expect to arrive 1530 minutes later going either direction than what the schedule below says!  Also, if the bus fills up with riders you may have to remain standing for the ride  although they have been known to provide another shuttle if there are many extra passengers.

The buses are equipped with bike racks for bringing your bicycle with you across the Yolo Causeway Causeway.  Each bus only has space for two bicycles  first come, first served.
