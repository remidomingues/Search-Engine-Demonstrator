Field Day is entirely run by UCD students with faculty and staff advisors. They have to arrange to get flowers, cattle, judges, animal carcasses, bug samples, dairy samples, engines, horses and more.  They have to dig  holes for Land Judging, set up science displays from Agriscience Fair, and make and grade tests for almost every contest.  They will have to grade quickly, as tests and results are turned in to get scores tabulated in time for the contest critiques immediately afterward and the award ceremony a few hours later.

Its harder for the UCD coordinators since they generally have the earliest contest on the circuit, and therefore the least amount of time to prepare for it.  As most of the contests start around 8 am on Saturday, it makes for a very long day for the coordinators.  Nonetheless, they try to put on the best competition they can to put up a good face for UC Davis, since this is the only time a lot of these prospective students see the campus.
