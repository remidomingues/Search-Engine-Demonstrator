UCD Bathrooms are important to talk about because cleanliness is next to Godliness and you want to crap in a Holy place, dont you?

Please visit our Bathrooms as well for more general (townwide) bathroom fun.


 Cleanest 

  Earth and Physical Sciences building  Brand new building, awesome Eco friendly bathrooms (i.e., and TMI: flushless urinals), super clean!
  Giedt Hall  Brand spanking new bathrooms.
  ARC  Go there while they are still new.  One of the few bathrooms on campus that have quilted toilet paper.  Sometimes theres music in the bathrooms but always naked people.  Also, the smell is usually far from pleasant due to a mixture of body odor and that other type of smell.  None the less, they are clean...  The ones by the Ballroom on the north end are the best ones, minus the nakedness.
    The north end has an ant problem
  Academic Surge  Nice clean low traffic bathrooms.
  Bainer Hall  Nice and clean in an engineering building of course...
    Always at least a few degrees warmer than the rest of the building, for some reason.
  Meyer Hall  I worked here for nine months and was consistently impressed with the bathrooms cleanliness.
  Dutton Hall  I ate lunch off one of these toilets.
    The best bathrooms Ive ever used on campus. clean, spacious, welllit, and most importantly, empty
  Kemper Hall  Leave it to engineers to leave things feeling sterile... I wish this were the case.  I have it from friends that the womens restrooms are indeed clean, but the mens?  Theres a permanent scum layer an inch thick covering the entirety of the 2nd floor mens room by the vending machines.  I think its congealed pee vapor.
  Kerr Hall  This is really the place to go if youre in Wellman Hall Wellman and you need to use the bathroom.  All the floors have excellent bathrooms because the building is filled with nuts.  Also, the bathrooms on the highest floors have great views, if you dont mind the feeling that youre being watched by hundreds of people. But unless youre both male and female, you might have to go up or down a floor to use a Kerr bathroom.
    If youre planning a visit to this bathroom, be aware that you may receive funny looks while wandering around
    Also, they do not allow more than a single person in the bathroom at a time since it has become unisex, though they never seemed to have thought of installing a lock. Instead, there is an occupied/unoccupied sign you have to flip when you go in an out
  Lower Freeborn Hall  This is the basement of Freeborn Hall Freeborn, and there is a new bathroom near KDVS and The California Aggie. Its worth the walk down from the Memorial Union MU. Also, if you are making a trip in the middle of the night, the lights in this bathroom have a motion sensor installed and will turn on automatically when you open the door, very nifty.
  Memorial Union MU  second floor and up.  Might have something to do with the offices of some people with power up there...
  Physical Sciences Library  More sterile engineers...
  Plant and Environmental Sciences Building  main bathrooms are nice, watch out for the unisex ones though.
  Robert Mondavi Institute for Wine and Food Science Robert Mondavi Institute  has new, greener toilet levers; up for #1, down for #2.  Gotta love doin your business, AND saving the environment at the same time!
 Sproul Hall Mens restrooms on oddnumbered floors, Womens on the evens. Because there are few undergraduate classes held here, most restrooms receive little traffic and are used mostly by graduate students, professors, and staff, who have been scientifically proven to flush more than undergraduates. As a result the restrooms are generally much better kept than in Olson.
  EU III  and yet again the engineers keep it clean.  the whole damn building is just clean.  might as well eat off the floors in there.
  Veihmeyer Hall  nice big old fashioned bathrooms.
    Theres also the odd little one underneath the eastern staircase.
  Mathematical Sciences Building  brand new building with clean and shiny bathrooms.
  Genome and Biomedical Sciences Facility  Very fresh and clean, complete with decorations and air fresheners on the second floor. Like a home away from home.
  Chemistry Annex  5th floor. delicious solitude. be aware that the motion activated lights may suddenly turn off during longer ahem visits.

 Decent 
  Chemistry  I dont really trust anything on the first floor...
  Experimental College
  King Hall  Old and slightly dingy, but generally quite clean.  Usually not too much smell.  Sadly, at least in the mens rooms, you have to use handcrank paper towel dispensers.  Kalen Gallagher ran for LSA President on a platform that included replacing the terrible paper towel dispensers.
  Physics and Geology
  Roessler Hall
  they are generally filthy these days because its the most common lecture hall that freshmen use
  Shields Library  not a terribly bad place to use the bathroom.  However, at night using the upstairs bathrooms can be kind of spooky since its so quiet and no one is around.
  Storer Hall  the higher story bathrooms are full of sunshine! The sinks are a little old and drippy, though.
  Wellman Hall  has plastic garbage bags over some toilets that, chances are, will never be fixed.  Comes with an eerie feeling at night. Most disgusting womens bathrooms. Another strange thing about the mens restrooms in Wellman is that the urinals are a strange cross between a urinal and a toiletphoto anyone?
  Womens Center
  Young Hall  Although not spectacularly clean, the womens bathroom is worth a visit for the little art gallery alone.
      the mens bathroom is also worth a visit if you like to browse gay forums

 TouristTrodden and SCARY 

  Memorial Union MU first floor (both east and west)
    The Coffee House has pretty bad bathrooms, but EXCELLENT vandalism in the mens bathrooms.  Sometimes entire conversations are carried out on the walls of the stalls.
  MUGA  Horrible.  Absolutely horrible, and quite possibly the worst on campus.  But if you are in the middle of bowling or playing billiards, I guess you have no choice but to use them.  Users/StevenDaubert Disputes this as of late 2006. They have been remodeled, more than once, and the employees are tasked to keep them clean, they are vastly improved from the old picture set. Last time I was in them they were spotless and automated with flushing, soap dispensing, etc. There also was a sign stating you if you had issue with them you could tell an employee and they would bring it up to spec.
  South Silo Bathroom EVIL HAUNTED SOUTH SILO BATHROOM beside the Craft Center There are holes in the walls of the mens room stalls so you can look into them!  Users/TheRadish
  123 Sciences Lecture Hall  Maybe New, but has a terrible odor coming from I believe the drains that never cease. I once believed it was a person causing it, but after multiple uses, just walking in gives this pungent smell that makes me want to puke every time! (moved to disgusting section) Users/mperkel
  The Silo  The mens bathroom on the first floor is pretty rank. The urinals smell like rancid piss and splash urine back at you. Dont go in with only shorts and sandals on. This bathroom gets a ton of use.  However, the womens room on the first floor isnt bad at all.  It is at about the same level as the womens on the top story.
  Olson Hall  Seems to have standing water on the floors at least 3 out of 5 days during the academic week.  You may find a personal flotation device prudent at times.
  Someone was Violent Crime violently murdered in an oncampus mens room in January 1985.  Current pool is at $6 for anyone who can discover which one (perhaps evil haunted restroom referenced above?)
   The bathroom in question is in the Physics and Geology PHYGEO building. http://www.crimezzz.net/serialkillers/J/JONES_jeffrey_gerard.php Source. Users/JoePomidor

20050208 23:13:18 nbsp I got the chance to go into the mens bathroom in the basement of Storer and it was really cool! Users/RohiniJasavala

20050210 21:28:03 nbsp dude nothing beats the bathrooms in Olson......yummmy Users/LauraPeguero

20050307 10:33:26 nbsp The violent murder was in the PhysicsGeology Bldg on 2nd floor mens bathroom. Reference from Tragic events Users/BradCuppy

I think the school needs to get rid of the current urinals and should instead use flushless urinals.  That will save us tons of water, not to mention money as well.  Althought, I wouldnt be against the campus installing a bunch of fake trees with signs on them that say coed outdoor restroom facilities.  Either way Im pissed off.   Users/RobertBaron

20050413 16:06:02 nbsp Please report Jock Artist activity here when you see it! Users/RickEle

20050821 18:58:26 nbsp I used the mens room somewhere in the Death Star. Users/MichelleAccurso

20050822 23:06:20 nbsp My most dreaded bathroom stall on campus is in the basement of Olson...in the girls bathroom there is a stall that is HALF the size of the rest. Its the third one down, right next to the handicapped stall. The walls of the stall are almost touching the toilet itself. You could easily injure yourself somehow in there!  Users/KarlaFung

20051020 01:05:50 nbsp I remember quite clearly my freshman year that there existed one of the greatest bathroom wall stories I have ever read. It was in the bathrooms in the eastern part of the Arboretum. On the far stall in the mens bathroom existed a sex story about this guy and his girlfriend, with excruciating detail he explained his sexual exploits. But it gets better. See this guy apparently graduated 1981 or something and he had it signed. The best part though, he made an addendum to the story 10 years later with his now wife who had a decade earlier been his girlfriend. I wish I could show more evidence of this, for one funny event and two a time chronicling thing. But alas the university must have gone into that bathroom and had that place updated, I returned my sophomore with much dismay, since that story should have gone down in the history books.  Users/MikeMele
   20060921 I was in that same bathroom (on Wyatt Deck) yesterday and I must say it was the foulest smelling bathroom I have been in in a long time Users/CaseyBarc

20060512 10:28:59 nbsp The new Sciences Lab building sucks for taking a dump.  The toilets are so high that my feet dangle! That hasnt happened since I was 4.  I think they try to keep them smelling nice since the SLB is what they use to impress everyone from outside campus. Also, the 2nd floor MU bathroom gets a lot of dumping action and smells accordingly (for the Mens room anyway).  I suggest going 3rd floor or higher ) Users/DavidBatten

20060727 12:11:45 nbsp I always liked MUGA, because unless theres a kids birthday party, theyre empty and clean... Users/MeganCurtis

20060811 23:12:37 nbsp Kerr Hall has been my favorite for years, literally. Users/CameronMenezes

20060824 00:39:53 nbsp I suggest that tourist trodden and scary be separated. There are plenty of scary bathrooms on campus  ever been in the mens room in the basement of Storer Hall? I can tell you that the mens room in the Campus Data Center is pretty scary too, and neither one of those are tourist trodden. Users/ChrisLambertus

20060918 15:41:01 nbsp The new automatic paper towel dispensers that are being installed around campus suck.  You usually have to touch the sensor to get it to dispense.  That defeats the whole purpose, which I assume is reducing the spread of germs not saving paper. Users/CharlesMcLaughlin

20080717 00:38:15 nbsp Ive always had a soft spot in my heart for the basement bathroom at the PSE library. You can tell its a bit aged, but it has aged quite gracefullylike a fine wine...if wine were a bathroom. Users/SteveKent

20090219 23:05:11 nbsp The womens restroom over at Hart Hall is pretty nasty (although the graffiti on the stall wall is pretty interesting). Users/strawberry

20090317 01:19:19 nbsp ARC Ballroom bathrooms are the best, no question.  Its where the employees go. Users/sososharp

20091006 11:46:56 nbsp The womens bathroom on the first floor of Haring (over by 1204) is creepy and disgusting... theres usually only one light on, making it feel like a bad horror movie, and theres a bed behind the sinks... any explanation?  Users/acparsons

20101120 19:11:59 nbsp The phys/geo murder was detailed in an email to physics department faculty and staff, probably in 2008, but I dont have a copy of the email/emails any longer.  Perhaps another physics grad? Users/allwheat

20140307 21:38:51 nbsp Theres a bathroom with urinals that look kind of like this.  cant remember where it is.  Anyone have any idea?  Image(test_bathroom.jpg) Users/ucdstud
