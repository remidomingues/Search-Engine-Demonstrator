A short list of things every UC Davis student should do to be respectful to your peers and professors. More general lists of classroom etiquette, from a prof or TA perspective, can be found http://rateyourstudents.blogspot.com elsewhere.  See also UCD Email Etiquette.
  Dont SPAM your professor. Excessive emails can be annoying. If you have several questions, ask them after class or in office hours. Do not send emails asking professors about what is going to be on tomorrows exam.
  Turn your cell phone off.
   This is a huge distraction for everyone in the class.  Apart from showing a cute little video at the beginning of every class (like at a movie theatre), Im not sure what to do about it.  What is most frustrating, I guess, is when the offender doesnt even look embarrassed.  Users/CovertProfessor
    Yep, I remember once when a phone went off in class... and the person actually answered it and said Hello? The whole class laughed, I guess at the persons audacity or cluelessness. However, I dont think this is a big deal overall. People are usually appropriately embarrassed (especially if the ring tone is something like In Da Club) and quickly silence their phone. Ive also been in more than one lecture where the professors cell phone goes off.  Users/DanielWorthington
  Avoid food distractions. Ideally you wouldnt eat in class, but sometimes theres no time to eat in between classes. If you eat in class, be respectful. Dont bring smelly food, crunchy food, and avoid plastic wrap which is really loud when manipulated.
  Humility is a virtue. Do not think that you are smarter than anyone else in class, even if you are.  You are not.  Therefore, don’t patronize your classmates with obnoxious comments directed at them.
   I think its great when students comment on other students comments – voilà, we have a dialogue!  It just needs to be done respectfully. Users/CovertProfessor
   Is it just me, or do a lot of these rules seem patronizing in of themselves, at least the way they are worded? For instance, perhaps this one could simply be changed to Be Respectful of Other Peoples Opinions or something along those lines. Users/DanielWorthington
  If you have to be late, at least be polite about it. If you think you are late for a class, and you see people hanging around outside your classroom, ask those people first if they are waiting for your class, don’t open the classroom door, stick your head in, this may only make yourself look bad as you interrupt some other class. If you are late for class, even a little bit late, enter the class from the back of the room and take the first available seat that doesnt require you climbing over the students who got there on time.  If that seat is down in front, dont take it, just sit on the floor in the back.  Your going to the front of the class, or coming in the front of the class across the path of a teacher who is lecturing, is really rude. So dont do it.
  And if youre early... Move to the center of the row to sit down. That way people who get there later dont have to climb over ten people to get to the only open seat in the center, because you sat on the very end for no reason. Exception to this rule: lefthanders sitting in lefty desks.
  Ask good questions at appropriate times. If the class is a lectureonly class, find out the professors policy on asking questions. Most professors encourage students to ask questions. Participation engages the students and is sometimes the only opportunity for the professor to gauge how well the students absorb the material. That said, the classroom should not be used as an arrogance showcase. Dont ask questions just to inflate your ego, and remember that nobody likes a knowitall. If you find yourself the only student asking questions, keep in mind that students who monopolize class time can unintentionally intimidate other students from asking questions. When you do ask questions, try to stay on topic. Tangential questions can steer the professor off course, and can make the core material difficult to digest for other students.
   As a professor, I welcome all questions.  In fact, I wish more students asked questions.  What I dont welcome is when people pontificate.  Make it short and sweet, and remember that the classroom isnt your personal soapbox.  Also, keep in mind that a professor may call on someone who hasnt spoken in awhile, even if you had your hand up first  and sometimes we just need to get back to the material, and so some questions may need to be asked during office hours.  (Speaking of which:  please come to office hours!  It is one of the most underutilized resources on campus.  Yes, some professors miss office hours, or dont like questions; all I can say is, seek out the professors who will give you the education that you deserve). Users/CovertProfessor
   Listen when your fellow students ask questions and make comments; often those are the most insightful things said during the class period.  Users/CovertProfessor
  Be polite. When someone says to you, for your kindness, Thank You, reply, You’re welcome, not No Problem. the former shows better that you care for the other individual rather than that you are begrudgingly lending them aid.
   Im not sure what this has to do with classroom behavior, in particular, but Ive never thought that no problem implies begrudging aid.  To me, it implies, please dont worry that youve inconvenienced me.  Users/CovertProfessor
   Ive never been annoyed by people saying no problem i agree with covertprofessors analysis of such a statement.  However i dislike it when i say thank you, and the other person says uh huh.  It just sounds rude like, oh yeah i was expecting a thank you and your not really welcome. Users/MattHh
  Be respectful. The overwhelming majority of college students are over 18, and thus adults.  So, female students are not girls, but women; male students are not boys, but men.  And no one is a kid.  (Sadly, some professors also break this rule; maybe we need a page for professor etiquette, too).
   Debatable for sure, I never understood why they are called college kids... As a kid I was like wtf they are grown... Possessing hindsight its a different story Users/StevenDaubert
  Do not engage in private conversation in class during lecture.  This should be obvious, but Im amazed how often it happens.  It is so rude.  If you missed something, make a note to ask your pal after lecture to fill you in.  Also, when the professor stands up in front of the class to begin lecture, and you should know this by knowing the time, immediately be quiet.  This is not hard to do, but again, Im amazed how often it doesnt happen.  We are in class to hear the teacher or each other discussing the material in an organized fashion, not to hear how drunk you got last night.
  Dont sleep in class. You may be ejected.
   Maybe the better advice here would be: get enough sleep so that you dont fall asleep in class.  If it happens once or twice... well, it happens.  But if its happening regularly, theres definitely a problem.

  i think as long as the student doesnt disturb anyone else and providing that its a decently sized room where its not conspicuous, it should be let go. considering how often students skip classes, it should be taken under consideration that the student willingly came to lecture despite being so tired  Users/FredChen
  Dont read the newspaper in class.  Why are you in the room if you arent going to pay attention?
   Personally, I dont think there is anything wrong with reading the newspaper in class, given certain circumstances.  If you are reading something, you are most certainly awake, which cannot be said of many students during many lectures.  Furthermore, most people dont read the newspaper, but rather glance at certain articles/pictures.  Thus, this type of reading shouldnt interfere with ones ability to take down notes.   Users/PatrickSing
    From one perspective, reading and sleeping are the same  neither sleepers nor readers are fully paying attention.  (People can doze and catch things here and there).  From another perspective, the newspaper readers are worse than the sleepers.  Sleepers are tired and cant help it, whereas the newspaper readers can.  I have a lot more sympathy for the sleepers.  Remember, this is a page on etiquette.  Imagine what it is like to have spent hours preparing a presentation, only to stand in front of a bunch of people who are reading the paper, texting their friends, etc.  Lets just say that its a bit deflating  and yes, its rude.  Users/CovertProfessor
    Some professors and students find reading the news paper even worse than sleeping because sleeping is usually less distracting. Its one thing when someone has folded up the NP really small so they can do the sudoku (even though i dont agree with this) and its another thing to have it all laid out and big. Also there is noise that is associated with the newspaper.  As a student i find it really irritating when someone is reading one next to me. Users/MattHh
  It isnt over until its over. Dont start collecting your things while the professor is still talking, unless the class is running over time; the rustling of backpacks, papers, etc., is very distracting.  If your professor isnt ending class on time, you could try discussing this politely with him/her during office hours, pointing out that you have another class to attend which is all the way across campus, etc. It is your professors responsibility to end the class on time, and he or she should be sympathetic to your concerns. If the professor continues to end late, sit in the back or next to an aisle so when you leave you minimize the disturbance.
  Show some interest in your own education. Dont pick a class solely on the basis of how it fits into your schedule.  Pick your classes based on the topic and the professor who is teaching the class.  It might seem as though you will be happier with the cozy schedule; trust me, you wont.  I see those students all of the time, and its ultimately frustrating for them and frustrating for me.  At the risk of being trite, college is an opportunity to learn all sorts of amazing things; dont squander it.
   The idea of having three consecutive 2hour engineering lectures is not pleasant.  The possibility of having three tests/quizzes in a row on one day, or having three homework assignments due on one day.  Scheduling matters!  Users/PatrickSing
    Good point.  I think it is wise to schedule classes so you can handle the load.  (But you can still try to pick classes that interest you, given the constraints of scheduling).  Some students, however, will do the opposite  they will schedule all of their classes in a bunch to get them over with.  I realize that many students have other commitments they are trying to fit in: work, family, etc.  But they do themselves a disservice when too many are packed together (as Patricks post suggests), and they do themselves a double disservice if they take courses that they are not interested in.  Users/CovertProfessor

     one of my freshman mistakes was bowing to the pressure of a quick graduation and scheduling 3 major classes in the same quarter. needless to say, my gpa was not happy
  If you are absent, come back with your manners intact. Professor Pet Peeve #1: I missed class on (fill in the date).  Did I miss anything?  Nope, not a thing  we were waiting for you.
  Raise your hand. If you want to ask a question or make a comment, it is best to raise your hand. If the professor does not see you and appears to be moving on to a new topic, then an interjection may be warranted.
  Take a shower before coming to class. This shouldnt mean that you literally take a shower 20 minutes before class, but more like shower within the last 24 hours of the class.  If you are going to sit between two people in one row, and maybe among dozens of people in one section, there is nothing else in the world that will ruin the lives of those other people than the smell of BO for a one or two hour lecture.

  for gods sake, when you are sitting elbow to elbow in the middle of a lecture, dont take out a cotton swab and start cleaning your ears

  Cheesy classroom etiquette I saw the best one yesterday. I dont know if this qualifies as etiquette; it definitely qualifies as ethics. The infraction took place in a discussion group. A student came in that day and he/she hadnt done the reading. No, it wasnt me. He/she scrambled to get clued in by asking us, his/her session mates, the Cliff Notes version of the assigned reading. We happily updated him/her so he/she could play along too, but I was slightly cheesed by it all. What got me (and I dont know if Im so much annoyed as I am galled) was how he/she acted when called upon by the teacher assistant to give his/her impressions of the book. He/She produced a pretty crafty answer but took it too far by talking at length about that which he/she had no idea. I think the TA was on to him/her, but maybe not. So, you be the judge: ethics or etiquette. I think it is a question of humility as well.



(on WSs advice to not ask questions during lectures) is ridiculous.  Im not paying thousands of dollars every quarter so I can sit silently and politely in lecture, not asking my questions, just to avoid offending some prick in the front row.  If Ive got a question and I feel like asking it, Im damn well going to ask it. Users/PaulHarms ph

  Also, please learn the difference between its and its, which you should have learned in grade school.  One way to remember the proper usage is that its is a contraction for it is.  If you can substitute it is in the sentence, then use its.  But if you cant, then use its.  (Its is a possessive, as in the sentence: Davis has a lot of bikes for its size.).  You should also know the difference between your and youre; between their, there, and theyre; and between too and to.  Users/CovertProfessor

20070609 20:18:17 nbsp I dont think it is necessarily a bad thing to take a class because it fits in with your schedule. In college you dont always know what you are interested in because you havent taken the class yet, so deciding between classes with something like class time puts in a little bit of randomness.   Sometimes the randomness leads you places you never would have thought about, but end up loving. Plus, if youre not a morning person, youre not going to go to your 8 am class.  Users/AmyGoogenspa

 I can see your point, Amy.  If you are the type of student who is open to learning new things, then it wont matter if you pick a random class because you will give it half a chance.  But not everyone is like that, unfortunately.  Users/CovertProfessor

20070609 22:17:35 nbsp I have to disagree about arriving early to class and sitting in the center. When I get there early I like to sit towards the edge of the row so I can get out faster. People can choose where ever they want to sit.  Users/SimonFung
 Well, then, I am absolutely sorry when I bump across you and everyone else in my way to the center as everyone has a need to leave faster. Is that few seconds advantage in leaving such a big issue anyway, I prefer to not have my feet stepped, and not be hit by backpacks. ~Users/DavidPoole
  Dave, dont worry about my knees. I took food science 10 last quarter and in a lecture hall of 500 freshman, it takes 5 minutes just to be able to stand up and leave. I am glad I didnt have a class right afterwards because there would have been no way for me to leave and make it on time.

20070628 21:01:48 nbsp Ever have that child in class who thinks he or she is not only smarter than all of the other students, but smarter than the professor as well? This is really a superclass of the children who think they are smarter than all the other students. Yes, you know who you are. You are the one who thinks the professor is having a private conversation with you. You are the one who answers 36 questions without raising your hand (I counted, jackass) and without waiting more than a femtosecond to exhibit your severe case of the verbal runs. You are Einstein reincarnate. Maybe even smarter, more like God or something. Anyway, shut up, you sound like an ass, and you are acting really stupid. The best part is that when the professor shuts you down you are too full of yourself to realize that you were just humiliated in front of 50 students who want to throw pencils through your eyes and force you to wander alone for a few years before returning.

20070921 12:11:03 nbsp What about doing homework for other classes during class? I had a class where the prof covered the material rather slowly. I was one of the few people in class answering questions and participating in discussions, and was acing the quizzes without studying, but was bored most of the time in class. I felt it was the best use of my class time to quietly do homework since I had plenty of it. I was able to listen and take notes at the same time, but the teacher took offense and asked me to quit.  Is doing homework in class rude in general? Do other teachers have issues with this? I feel that if Im paying for the class and not being disruptive, how I keep my hands and mind busy is up to me. I also see how it could drive the prof nuts if Im seemingly not paying attention to the lecture theyve prepared. Thoughts? ~~~~ Users/NoahElhardt
 Speaking for myself, I put a lot of time into preparing for a class, and expend a lot mental and physical energy during the class itself.  So, its rather... deflating when people are doing other things during class, as well as distracting, and yes, I do think it is a bit rude.  While its true that you are paying for the class, its also true that we are not machines, and so we are motivated by interested students, demotivated by uninterested students, no matter how hard one tries to be on all the time, regardless.  Having said that, if someone were answering questions and participating in discussion  and thus, obviously listening  Im much less likely to have an issue with it.  I can only imagine that you were in a small class, or at least sitting up front, because otherwise how would the professor have known?  I do think the rules are a bit different, if, say, you are sitting around a small seminar table where everyone can see that youre doing something else.  (By the way, Id also be open to a student telling me that they thought I was going a bit too slowly  that kind of feedback, given in an email or during office hours, can be very useful.  Of course, sometimes it just happens that students are learning at very different paces, and thats a tough problem to solve).  Users/CovertProfessor
  Ive recently taken to sewing during class. I worry about it being a distraction to others and try to stay towards the back or sides of the class, but for me, its a miracle solution to the problems Ive always (since grade school) had with being able to stay awake and attentive, regardless of teacher and interest level of the class. Im able to pay closer attention and take better notes when occupied with something relatively brainless. It sounds like NoahElhardt may be in a similar situation (not to imply the other homework is brainless). Im guessing this is a situation where its probably best to talk to the professor and explain that it isnt anything personal or a lack of desire to be in the class. Noah  not to suggest you take up sewing, but maybe something more neutral to work on would be taken less personally. I do have a professor who will kick students out of class for doing other homework. Thankfully, Im taking it as a telecourse (WCC), so he cant see me being less than 100% attentive :) Users/JessicaLuedtke
   Talking to the professor about it is a good suggestion, especially if you frame it as a way to help you concentrate.  Ive never had a student say something like that to me, but I have had students tell me that they work the night shift, so if they sleep in class, please dont take it personally; or that they are diabetic, so sometimes they have to eat in class... things like that.  Of course, I cant vouch for my fellow professors for sure, but in my book, an explanation like that goes a long way.  Users/CovertProfessor

20071106 00:22:57 nbsp I dont agree with the part that says you have to move to the center of a row of seats if you are one of the first to arrive in the hall.  A lot of people arrive early so that they can get comfortable seats in the lecture hall, and generally speaking, the most comfortable are the ones that are along the aisles where you are guaranteed to have some breathing room (e.g. not completely surrounded by seats and other people).  Thus, why should late people be rewarded with those seats?
 Users/PatrickSing
   Agreed.  I always ended up picking my seats based on how much space I have versus how much other people will hassle me. Trying to get the aisle seat, but near the front, or side, or where the rows are unevenly spaced so that you can slip in and out against the wall.  Especially during a test.  One of the worst experiences I had was when a TA forced me and others to move to the middle of a row during a midterm in Young Hall.  I finished my test early and was stuck. And it was during winter quarter, when the heater is on and the room gets muggy and stuffy and ugh...  The early bird should get the worm.  Aisle seats are highly desired. Users/Edwins ES

   one time for a chem midterm in chem 194, i was 1 minute late to the test and saw an open seat next a guy in the top left corner. it was a row of 5 seats and 2 people were sitting on seat 1 and 4. knowing the every other seat rule for midterms, i asked the guy on seat 4 if he could scoot over so that i could sit in seat 3 and take the test. the guy actually had the nerve to look me in the face and refuse me FOR ABSOLUTELY NO REASON. i spent 2 precious minutes looking for a seat before i took my test. end rantUsers/fredchen

20081021 08:39:25 nbsp I agree with the above comments. The early bird gets the worm. I would arrive early at my first class of the day and sit on an end in the back so I could exit ASAP to get to my next class, to prevent being late. It takes serious time hoof it from Meyer to Young on foot! I think the reward for getting to class on time is getting to sit where you please.

20081021 11:29:24 nbsp During my NPB 101 final (back in the day), this girls cell phone started ringing. In the middle of the exam.   It was loud and it had one of those truly obnoxious ring tones (Im sure the owner thought it was just so cute though).  Anyway, the girl did not shut it off right away.  She just let it ring and ring while continuing to work on her exam.

 Normally, when people forget to turn off their phones and it starts to ring, they realize they screwed up and have the decency to immediately silence the phone.  Not this girl.  She didnt seem concerned that she was causing a huge disturbance during a final (and for a lot of us, an extremely important one).  She wasnt properly ashamed, either.  Her cell phone just kept ringing and ringing (youd think that it would have stopped and just gone to voice mail after so many rings, but not this one). And then finally, my buddy (who was also taking the final) turned to her and yelled, Turn it off!.

Oh it was ridiculously awesome.  Users/CurlyGirl26

 This one still seems open to interpretation. I personally say no worries, and I dont think that that is a big deal. If someone complained about it, I would probably think they were reading too much into the specific phrasing of my response.

20081112 21:16:42 nbsp I CANNOT stress enough how annoying it is to eat in class. Sometimes the smells (combined with body heat and B.O.) is so bad I feel like throwing up or passing out. I do have two outofclassroom etiquette questions: do Professors get bothered if you ask questions through email? I dont live in Davis, so sometimes it is difficult for me to make Office Hours, so emailing my prof is a lot easier. Also, is it rude to ask a prof  if you can take a test early or at a later date (early, given they have enough time to prepare, and later in the event that you are very ill)? Users/ArianeMetz
  In general, I dont mind getting asked questions via email, but it depends on the question.  If it only requires a relatively short answer, then its fine.  But if it requires a longer answer, then usually those are too hard to get across over email and facetoface would be better.  Also, if you are asking for something (e.g., a letter of recommendation, an extension on an assignment), these requests have a bit more weight if they are asked for in person.  As for asking to take an exam early: generally I would never allow this, because it would mean that Id have to have a completely separate version of the exam just for that person, and often I dont have the exam ready early in any case.  (Professors procrastinate too, you know).  But if someone was genuinely ill or had some other serious emergency that prevented them from taking the exam at the scheduled time, then I wouldnt hesitate to let them take it late.   Users/CovertProfessor
  If youre ill enough to want to delay an exam, make sure you get even a cursory check up at Student Health and get a doctors note from them.  It may seem trivial, but do it  many professors really dont like the change up.  Especially in smaller upper division courses.   I was once severely sick during finals week, took two exams and decided I couldnt handle the other three and tried to delay them.  It was extremely awkward, but each professor handles it differently. One was extremely nice about it, the other was just fine and cordial, and one was a huge jerk about it and didnt want to let me delay it despite the doctors note from student health.  I argued with him (I believe theres some sort of policy somewhere saying they have to), and he ended up honoring it reluctantly. He didnt want to rewrite the test and take the time away (he was young, his second year teaching) I was scared as hell hed give me a monster test (and he actually threatened to give me a hugely different format/questions, with a followup of if I just want a normal test, why dont I just bring a few tissues to class, but thats another story).  They may have to modify an exam, or in the case of some courses, completely rewrite it, but its really a lot harder on you.  Youre sick, stressed, and trying to study.  In my case, I was diagnosed with a severe respiratory infection (chest xray in my hometown showed it was huge  I hate student health) and given some heavy duty antibiotics.  I was really sick :(  I ended up going back to the professors whose exams I delayed to either thank them or inform them I actually was very sick.  I didnt want the last one in particular to think I was trying to wuss out due to the sniffles (which he had implied).     TLDR; each professor handles it differently, if youre really sick visit student health and be sure to get an excuse note. Policy will be on your side.  Users/Edwins ES

20110120 13:19:47 nbsp THE BIGGEST concern for me is the inappropriate use of left handed desks. In a society that prides itself on equality dominant hand usage is a highly overlooked difference. It might not seem like a big deal to people who use everyday objects with their right hands without difficulty, but for a lefty like me, a lefthanded desk is an invaluable resource. In most classes there are only a handful of lefthanded desks out of the total number in the room; in fact, in some classes there are NO lefty desks even offered (in Olson its often only ONE). If you are NOT left handed, DO NOT use one of these desks.
 I realize that people like lefty desks because they are always on the end, and thus you can get out faster after lecture, but I get more than frustrated when I enter a class and see all of the lefty desks taken by righthanded people. Do you realize how difficult it can be to use a righty desk if you are not righthanded? Especially in sciencetype lecture halls like Chem or Everson? Those desks are literally a tiny plank of wood that rests on your right knee, and are of NO USE to a lefty like me.
So for the love of bacon, PLEASE DO NOT TAKE A LEFT HANDED DESK IF YOU ARE NOT LEFT HANDED!!!

20120606 19:45:33 nbsp Interesting page. Im a TA and a largely agree with most comments, although some, like where to sit, do feel a bit nitpicky. Also, Im a lefty, and have never really had a problem with regular desks. :)

One comment that has come up a few times is the I pay for this so X argument. I dont think this holds water. Paying tuition at a university is similar to holding stock in a company. You certainly have a say in how things run, but this doesnt give you license to do anything you want. Nor should you. One certainly pays at a restaurant, but this doesnt justify acting however one pleases, being rude to the waiters and other guests, etc.

 If you were the sole patron of a professor, and paid her individually to teach you twice weekly, then the I pay argument might work. Paying tuition certainly gives us a say, but it certainly doesnt entitle us to do whatever we want.
