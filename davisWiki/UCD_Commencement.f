UC Davis The university has commencement (graduation) ceremonies twice a year. Once in June after spring quarter and once in December after fall quarter. The commencement ceremonies are split up into multiple separate events for different colleges and even majors.

  Bars In Downtown Davis really like the June graduation.

 How to Graduate 
After a student has http://registrar.ucdavis.edu/graduation/ filed for graduation, they may choose to participate in the commencement ceremony, for which they have to http://commencement.ucdavis.edu/ register also.

 Tickets 
Students are mailed guest tickets in midMay.  The actual number received depends on the college and how many people are graduating. If available, extra ticket(s) can obtained with more details in the letter sent home to students.  Only guests need tickets, graduates do not need a ticket to get in.

Historically, the College of Letters and Science Spring Commencement has given five to six guest tickets per student, whereas the College of Ag gives closer to ten tickets.

Although university policy forbids selling tickets, giving them away is fine, so if you have extras, or need more, head over to UCD Commencement Ticket Swap ticket swap and help someone out!

 Doing it in style 
While some people show up in jeans and sneakers, they realize that theyre a little underdressed. Old sneakers stand out when youre walking across the stage so they should be avoided if you care about things like that. A decent percentage of people decorate their hats. This is totally allowable because you get to keep it after you graduate. People do everything from their name in glitter to lights, toy Unitrans Buses and cows. Whether you choose to decorate your hat or wear a colorful flower lei, the idea is that youll stand out so that your family in the stands can more easily see you.
