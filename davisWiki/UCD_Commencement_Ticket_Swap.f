This is a page for swapping tickets for the UCD Commencement ceremonies.  If you have tickets to offer, or need tickets, this is the place for you.  Please dont forget to list which commencement, including time, you have/need tickets for.   According to university regulations, you may not sell or buy tickets, or trade them for anything of monetary value, so lets try to keep it friendly.

You may add your swap as a comment, but it would be even better if you hit the edit button at the top of the page and add it in yourself! Good luck!
