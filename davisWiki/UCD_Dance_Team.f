The UC Davis Dance Team is an integral part of the Universitys school spirit. Alongside the Cheer Team and Aggie Pack, Dance Team uses its energy, showmanship, and talent to entertain the crowd at various sporting events. Having won four National titles within the past four years, the UC Davis Dance Team is one of the most hardworking teams on campus.
