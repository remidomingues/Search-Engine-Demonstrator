Summer 2010: The Equestrian Center is in the process of downsizing its lesson program because of budget cuts. A few horses will be kept for the team, and for use in occasional walk/trot lessons. Information about which horses are being kept, or where horses have been adopted to may not be 100% accurate.

The Equestrian Center has a number of lesson horses with different abilities and temperaments.
Please feel free to add descriptions and update the horse list if you know/remember these UCD Equestrian Center horses.

Bar 717 Horses (Camp Horses)

These horses are owned by Bar 717 Ranch in Hayfork, CA. They spend the summer at the ranchs summer camp, and come back to UCD for the school year. Jules & Ceniza, and Colt & Shinto look quite a bit a like, so remember to check their collars before grabbing any of them. (:
