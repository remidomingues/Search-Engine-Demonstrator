The Gamelan Ensemble is one of the performance classes at UC Davis offered through the Music Departments ethnomusicology program. Directed by music professor Henry Spiller and Ed Garcia, the class learns performance techniques of wiki:wikipedia:gamelan music, traditional court music of Indonesia. The ensemble mainly includes instruments made of bronze (gongs, gong chimes and metallophones) plus a wooden xylophone and drums.

The ensemble meets every Tuesday from 4 to 6 pm at 116 B St., next door to Delta of Venus. The class normally consists of less than a dozen people. It counts for one music performance unit; however, you will not find the course listed on the Open Classes site or in the Course Catalog, or really anywhere except here. So if youre interested in the course, you have to just come by, or email Henry Spiller at hjspiller@ucdavis.edu.

Here are some videos of the Gamelan Ensemble performing at a Noon Concert in Music 115:
