UCD Hazmat is a branch of the UC Davis Fire Department, they deal with really nasty things, and get called out when the research profs drop the ball in a really bad way. Albeit most of the time its accidental but they have had there share of nasty things / stupid students synthesizing things they shouldnt etc.

With an increasing reliance on technology in our industrial society comes an increasing dependence on exotic materials dangerous to humans.  This is particularly true at a large research university like UC Davis.  Currently there are approximately 3500 research laboratories on campus housing any combination of the following: combustible liquids, cryogenics, explosives, flammable solids, flammable liquids, flammable gases, organic peroxides, oxidizers, pyrophorics, carcinogens, corrosives, irritants, radioactives, poisons, and other highly toxic materials not otherwise classified.  These materials could pose a significant health threat to the students, staff, and faculty at UC Davis if an accident were to occur. ~ http://fire.ucdavis.edu/hazmat.htm


Im Gonna Make this into a table sooner or later
{{{
The Tactical Objectives of HAZMAT

 Hazardous Materials emergencies create situations that can be extremely dangerous to emergency responders, the public, and the environment.  With this in mind, the tactical objectives of HAZMAT operations are tightly regulated and geared toward minimizing the danger to emergency personnel and the public.
Safety

Securing a rescue scene in order to limit the danger posed to emergency responders.
Isolation/Deny Entry

Sealing off a scene in order to ensure public protection as much as possible.
Notifications

Notifying the appropriate agencies and jurisdictions.
Command

Setting up an incident command structure to ensure that tactical objectives are accomplished.
Identification/Assessment

Identifying the hazardous material.
Action Plan

Developing an action plan.
Protective Equipment

Determining the appropriate level of protection to be used by emergency responders as dictated by the type of hazard.
Containment & Control

Attempting to limit the spread of the hazard.
Protective Actions

Determining and executing the action most appropriate for public safety.  A public evacuation would be an example of a protective action.
Decontamination/Cleanup

Decontaminating patients, emergency personnel, and equipment.
Disposal

Removing the hazard to the appropriate waste site.
Documentation

Maintaining a record of the incident by sending reports to the appropriate agencies and establishing exposure records for emergency personnel involved in mitigating the incident.
Restoral

Returning to operational readiness by restocking equipment and supplies.  Debriefing emergency response personnel.
