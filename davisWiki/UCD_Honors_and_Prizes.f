 Deans Honors Lists 


According to Davis campus regulations, the quarterly Deans Deans Honors List includes names of students who have completed, for a letter grade, a minimum of 12 graded units in a specific quarter with a grade point average equal to or higher than the minimum grade point average attained by the upper 16 percent of those registered in the same class level and college during that quarter. Honors lists will be posted quarterly outside deans offices or on the deans office Web sites and a notation of these honors will be placed on each students permanent record by the Office of the University Registrar.

 Graduation Honors 

Honors at graduation are awarded to students who have a grade point average in the top percent of their college as shown in the table below. The College of Letters and Science requires that additional criteria be met for high and highest honors; see the table below.


Grade point averages from the winter quarter prior to graduation are used to determine the averages that will earn an honors designation. Following are the averages for winter quarter 2006. These averages will be used through winter 2007.

Grade Point Average by College

An honors notation is made on students’ diplomas and on their permanent records in the Office of the University Registrar.

College of Letters and Science. Graduation with “honors” requires that a student meet the appropriate grade point requirement described in the above table for all UC courses completed. Students who meet the grade point requirement for graduation with honors, and who complete the Honors Program of the College of Letters and Science, may be recommended by their departments for graduation with high honors or highest honors on the basis of an evaluation of their academic achievements in the major and in the honors project in particular. A notation shall appear on the student’s official transcript indicating that the 194H Honors Thesis was completed. Graduating students will not be awarded honors with the bachelor’s degree if more than eight units of grade I (Incomplete) appear on their transcripts. The College Committee on Honors may consider exceptions to this condition. Petitions for this purpose should be submitted to the deans office.

 The Honors Program of the College of Letters and Science 

The Honors Program in the College of Letters and Science permits students to pursue a program of study in their major at a level significantly beyond that defined by the normal curriculum. It represents an opportunity for the qualified student to experience aspects of the major that are representative of advanced study in the field. Successful completion of the College Honors Program is a necessary prerequisite to consideration for the awarding of high or highest honors at graduation.

Entrance into the honors program requires that a student have completed at least 135 units with a minimum grade point average of 3.500 in courses counted toward the major. Other prerequisites for entrance into the program are defined by the major. The program consists of a project whose specific nature is determined by consultation with the student’s major adviser. It may involve completion of a research project, a scholarly paper, a senior thesis, or some comparable assignment depending on the major. The project will have a minimum duration of two quarters and will be noted on the student’s record by a variable unit course number or special honors course designation. Successful completion of the honors program requires that a minimum of six units of credit be earned in course work for the project.

 Davis Honors Challenge 

(530) 7522335; http://wwwhonors.ucdavis.edu

The Davis Honors Challenge (DHC) is a campuswide program for highly motivated students who are interested in enhancing their education through special courses, closer contact with faculty and dynamic interaction with academic peers.

DHC courses are limited in size so that participants receive substantial individual attention from faculty. In return, students are expected to participate actively in analyzing real world problems. Honors courses and small honors sections of regular courses also encourage individual student participation and selfchallenge. Students satisfactorily completing the program will receive transcript notation for each academic year of participation.

First and secondyear students take two honors courses and one problemoriented interdisciplinary seminar per academic year. Second year students have the option to substitute an honors contract for an honors course. Thirdyear students are required to complete two honors contracts and one upper division honors seminar, a teambased project in conjunction with an outside interested party. Fourthyear students participate in a yearlong team project to identify real world problems, apply research, critical thinking, problemsolving and communication skills to develop viable solutions for their outside party.

Other components of the DHC include honors living learning communities, a mentorship program and a service learning program. Each of these programs is designed to enhance students college experience.

Entering firstyear students who file a “Statement of Intent to Register” at UC Davis will be mailed detailed information about the DHC application process. Continuing students may obtain information and an application from the DHC Office after the start of spring quarter.
