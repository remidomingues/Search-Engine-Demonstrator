The LLC is a lab in the basement of Olson Hall where students, primarily those taking language classes, can use to their advantage. If youre taking any lower division language classes, such as German 1, 2, 3, French 1, 2, 3, 21, 22, 23, and so on, you can get answers to the standard homework questions that are in the textbooks. You are likely to find classmates in the lab correcting their homework if it is a few minutes before the class in question.

There are tables, tape players, and computers for student use. You need your Reg Card to check out or use any of the stuff down there.
