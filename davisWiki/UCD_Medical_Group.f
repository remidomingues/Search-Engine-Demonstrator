UCD Medical Group is an outpatient satellite of UC Davis Medical Center UC Davis Health System in Davis with primary care and some lab facilities (blood tests, Xrays). For further testing they send you to the main hospital in Sacramento, but the service is top notch and very fast. Your health record can be tracked online through mychart, where you can also ask questions to your primary physician and request lab work, schedule other appointments, and read your test results.

20110422 14:26:46 nbsp Amazing service and I love using mychart for requesting blood tests and asking questions about the results. Some amazing employees stayed with me after work hours during a nasty visit. They also have the most amazing blood test technician I ever encountered. Users/MichaelNielsen

20140530 17:49:06 nbsp UC made Sutter Health so expensive this year that many of us changed to UC Davis, including my family.  This now seems to have been a dreadful mistake.  The problems are mostly administrative rather than medical, but the issues are so numerous that they make getting timely medical care almost impossible.  I know from professional staff who work for UC Med that doctors are under pressure to increase their case loads, and this shows in the long waits for appointments.  And the scheduling of appointments is chaotic with lots of waiting: waiting for someone to answer the phone (20 minutes on hold is typical), waiting days for someone to return your message to the online scheduling system, waiting for them to correct the appointment they made at an arbitrary time when youve told them you cant come.  Everyone is always very pleasant, but they just dont seem to know what they are doing.  Just last week I showed up for an appointment at 4 pm, only to be told that the doctor had jury duty.  Couldnt someone have called me? I asked.  Oh, we called everyone this morning, they said.  But I was at home all morning and there was no call from you nor is there a message from you.  Blank looks, apologies.  Not good enough.  Next year well go back to Sutter even though it is more expensive.  If you have a chronic, serious medical condition that requires you to be able to get prompt service, stay away from UCD medical center.  From what I have heard, Kaiser would have been the better alternative. Users/EllenRobert
