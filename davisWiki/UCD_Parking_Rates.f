Ill see if I can track down the sheet that Ive got showing how much parking has gone up over the years.

  Most Campus Parking Permits parking permits on Campus including parking for events at the Mondavi Center, are $8.00.




A and C prices are quarterly.

Transportation And Parking Services is in charge of parking on campus.

20041218 17:23 nbsp Parking permits were going up a dollar a year for a while.  At least they finally settled down this year. Transportation and Parking Services TAPS people say you should blame the administration, not them.  Even though we have the lowest rates in the University of California UC, it costs way too much.

20041219 10:14:06 nbsp The funny thing is that TAPS lies about their nighttime enforcement.  Does anyone whos ever worked at TAPS know what their REAL enforcement hours are?  Users/JaimeRaba

20050404 14:06:02 nbsp TAPS enforces Monday thru Friday 7am to 10pm.  Yes, there really are people working during all of those hours.  On weekends, if there is a special event, they will enforce the lots that they are selling permits in. Users/GreatWhiteEric

20070418 18:15:57 nbsp Isnt charging special events parking a little... wrong somehow?  The signs and information clearly states that parking permits are required MF, with nothing about special events included.  It seems like theyre just trying to squeeze out every dollar they can by charging on a Saturday. Users/AllisonEriksen
   Usually if there is a special event being charged for, signs will be placed in front of the lot a few days prior to the event.  If Mondavi Center, for instance, requests that TAPS staff the lots for stuff like vehicle services (like if someone needs a jump start on a dead battery) then TAPS will probably be charging in that lot.
