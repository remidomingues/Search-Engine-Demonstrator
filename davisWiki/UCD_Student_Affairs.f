 History 

In July 1970, the third UC Davis Chancellor chancellor of the UC Davis campus, James H. Meyer, appointed Thomas Dutton as the first vice chancellor for Student Affairs. The newly created administrative appointment encompassed the responsibilities of the former parttime positions of the Deans dean of students, and dean of men and women.

Chancellor Meyer created the position after determining what type of administrative structure might best deliver student services.

As vice chancellor for Student Affairs, Dutton restructured student programs to reflect the campuss academic planning and brought under one organizational umbrella enrollment services (admission, financial aid and registration), counseling, housing, health and recreation, ASUCD student government and student special services.
