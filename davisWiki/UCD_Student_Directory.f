A yearly publication by Creative Media that many feel is extraordinarily useless and wastes campus resources by publishing addresses that are only useful to stalkers and bulk (e)mailers. Its typically available for free in the Coffee House and is always overprinted. The reason for this waste is that it makes a profit due to the number of advertisements in it, despite the fact almost nobody picks it up. Many or most of the addresses and phone numbers are out of date, making it fairly useless.

It is probably better to use http://www.ucdavis.edu/search/search_people.html this online search.

Some find it to be a valuable way to connect with people, which leads to increased productivity, comparing it to SBCs Davis telephone directory. Unfortunately this information is not entirely online and browsable in the same format, so that having a printed copy is not necessarily a waste of paper. Also in this regard, it pales in comparison with the amount used by other advertisers. It is only an annual publication; newspapers have vastly greater runs, with daily inserts.

Other arguments in favor of its publication:  Calling it a waste is questionable. Is it a waste from the publishers standpoint? If its profitable, the answers no. Is it a waste from the advertisers POV? Assuming they profit from the exposure, additional revenue it brings, then no. Is it a waste to the students who pick it up and use it? Probably not  nobody MADE them take it, its 100% voluntary  its not even pushed/promoted/etc. You have to go to the Coffee House, find it, and take it.

As far as being overprinted, every properly managed publication is overprinted  including the California Aggie Printing California Aggie. Bakeries overbake, airlines overbook, theaters oversell, etc. This brings increased utilization/efficiency, not less.
