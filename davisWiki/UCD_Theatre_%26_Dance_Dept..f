The UC Davis Department of Theatre and Dance is a part of the College of Letters and Science and is housed in Wright Hall. It offers one undergraduate Majors major (dramatic art, with a focus in either theater or dance), a Minors minor, an M.F.A. program (geared towards those pursuing a career in theater) and an interdisciplinary Ph.D. in Performance Studies.

The department includes over 120 undergraduate students majoring in dramatic art, 4045 graduate students, as well as 510 visiting professional artists and teachers each quarter. This mix of college students, midcareer professionals, and seasoned theater practitioners and scholars provides a dynamic environment for learning, experimentation, and growth, and a diverse, supportive community for all of its members.

 Undergraduate Program 
The major in dramatic art provides a liberal arts education and preprofessional training in theater. Students develop their abilities through a wide range of courses combining practical and theoretical skills that emphasize critical thought and independence in a context of challenging cooperative work.  From the first year, majors may participate in every aspect of bringing a work to the stage: acting, dance, directing, playwriting, choreography, stage management and design. Technical practice in the design and creation of sets, costumes, sound and lighting accompanies a firm grounding in dramatic literature, dance and theatre history, performance theory and criticism. This combination of theory and practice prepares students for a broad range of career opportunities.

It is strongly recommended that all UCD students take DRA 010 at some point in their college careers; this is the nonmajors variation of Drama 20, which is the majors required Intro to Dramatic Art course. It is taught by graduate students. A very basic overview of theatrical styles and history is given, along with basics of acting and speech, with emphasis on actually getting up and doing things. If you have to have class at 8 am, this is the one.
 Graduate Program 
The M.F.A. program offers a collaborative curriculum of interdisciplinary, teamtaught seminars that cover a full spectrum of performance practices, including acting, directing, choreography and design. Students in any area may elect to extend their expertise through advanced study in another discipline.

 Granada ArtistsInResidence Program 
The departments Granada ArtistsinResidence program is unique in American university theater, bringing prominent artists — directors, playwrights, choreographers, or filmmakers — to Davis during two academic quarters each year to teach and create a work for public performance. A special opportunity for graduate and undergraduate students to work closely with major theater and dance practitioners, it is a unique crosscultural experience.http://theatredance.ucdavis.edu/proartists/granada_history.aspx

Undergraduate students in the dramatic art major or minor (or even simply taking drama classes) can often be found in the Green Room.
