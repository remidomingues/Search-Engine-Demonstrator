UC Davis Womens Rugby was founded in 1997 with a few women interested in the game throwing the ball around for fun and has grown to a Division I, formally nationally ranked, club with close to 50 members.

The club not only provides a welcoming environment for women of all shape, size and skill level, teaching them rugby and getting them in shape, but it creates lasting bond of friendship between teammates.

The Womens Rugby Club consists of an A and a B side, allowing for players to learn the game and develop their skills before playing on the more competitive side that has the chance to go to playoffs.  However, both sides practice together, learn the same skills and plays and also playing the same number of games.  There are no tryouts to be on either team and players can easily move from B side to A side.

Every year the club elects a new President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, Fundraiser, Equipment Manager, Social Chair, Public Relations Chair, Apparel Chair, Tournament and Travel Chair, Recruitment Chair, and Website Manager, thus keeping many of the players involved in the management and success of the team.

The team practices three times a week during season (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday), with one conditioning session a week (Wednesday morning).  Season is from January to the end of March but players participate in conditioning sessions and practice starting in the fall.

Practices will start again in October of 2013. Anyone is welcome to practice, whether or not she has any prior rugby experience.
