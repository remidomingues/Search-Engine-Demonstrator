On May 30, 2011, The Enterprise http://wwwnew.davisenterprise.com/localnews/ucd/ucseminarsonlinefromecologytoevolutiontoelectronicteaching/ reported that UCTV had opened up the Seminars Project, an archive of a huge number of seminars recorded across the 10 UC campuses.  Currently, seminars appear from UCSF, Berkeley, Davis, Los Angeles, and the Washington, D.C. UC Center, but it sounds as though its likely to expand.  The project is the brain child of UC Davis entomology professor James R. Carey.  The seminars are available online for free at http://seminars.uctv.tv where theyre arranged by subject.
