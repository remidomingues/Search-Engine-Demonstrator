UC Berkeley, or just Berkeley (Berserkeley  coined by legendary SF Chronicle columnist Herb Caen, though now often devolved into Bezerkeley) or even Cal for short, is located in the city of Berkeley in Californias Bay Area.  Berkeley was where the University of California was first founded in  1868, and is arguably the most famous UC. The campus always seems to be discovering some unknown element or snagging a new Nobel laureate. Academically, Berkeley is noted for its Humanities and its Engineering programs. Socially, Berkeley is known for its fervent political activism and http://www.collegestories.com/storyview.aspx?sid1483 ugly girls.

In recent years, Berkeley has been losing ground to UCLA and UCSD in selectivity. Both UCLA and UCSD consistently receive more freshman applications than Berkeley. UCLA has had a lower acceptance for the past few admissions cycles. In fact, more of Californias top high school students have chosen not to attend Berkeley in favor of other UCs. This is mainly due to Berkeleys arguably inferior quality of life for students.

UC Davis and UC Berkeley share some bonds. At one time, Davis was University Farm the agricultural arm of the University of California, which also maintained a campus in Berkeley. (See Town History) Davis is now a separate university, but intercampus collaborative research and projects still occur between respective departments. You can still see the CA on our Aggie Band band, which stands for Cal Aggies. There is even a Davis Berkeley Shuttle shuttle service that Transportation And Parking Services TAPS provides between the two campuses (Shields Library UCD Shields Library to the Berkeley West Gate).

Classes here start on Berkeley Time, which is ten minutes after class is supposed to start. Berkeleys buildings are noteworthy for their NeoClassical architecture such as the Hearst Greek Theatre, the Valley Life Sciences Building and the Main Library. The University owns a plethora of small pockets of land outside the main campus that can be difficult for visitors to draw a distinction between the UC Regent property and the citys.
