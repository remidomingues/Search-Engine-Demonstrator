UC Davis, also referred to as UCD, The College, Campus, or University of California, Davis (on official documents), is the institute of higher education that impacts most everything in our The Dairy bucolic town. UC Davis is virtually a Davis city within a city, unbound by most City of Davis rules  in fact, campus provides its own infrastructure including Tap Water water supply, streets, UC Davis Landfill sanitation, airport, UC Davis Police Department police force and UC Davis Fire Department fire department. In fact, it is the largest employer in Yolo County, by a wide margin, employing 11,704 fulltime equivalents with an additional 1,289 season FTEs (2011 Sacramento Business Journal figures).  But the university is not immune to its impact on the city around it, so great effort is made to reach agreement with city leaders and the local population to ensure a relatively comfortable towngown relationship. Both City Council city leaders and UCD Administrative Officers university officials work together as often as they fight to work in the best interests of both citizens, students, and campus. To find out where to go and what to do at UCD, see our Campus page.


UC Davis has four UC Davis Colleges colleges and six professional schools. There are 103 undergraduate students undergraduate majors and 80 graduate groups with these figures fluctuating annually. Each program of study is managed by a University Departments university department. The university is run by UCD administrative officers and hardworking Campus Staff university staff. Classes are frequently taught by tenured Faculty professors, which is unusual in research universities  only a few courses are taught by lecturers or Grad Students graduate students. And when youre done with school, check out the UCD Commencement page.

As recently as 1996, UC Davis was ranked third amongst UC campuses in http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/usnews/edu/college/rankings/rankindex_brief.php US News and World Reports annual ranking of universities. Since then, UC San Diego has taken over the enviable position of third most prestigious UC. In fact, schools like UC Irvine and UC Santa Barbara have ranked higher than UC Davis in recent years.  Though many believe the UC Regents have a plan to make Davis the next flagship campus like Berkeley or UCLA, there is no documented evidence of this  but perhaps that is what the 2020 Initiative is aiming for.  What is certain is that a planned expansion of the undergraduate student body resulted in a less rigorous admissions policy for much of the 2000s. In recent years, however, Davis has become increasingly selective and has risen in the rankings, with the http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/college 2008 US News and World Report ranking UC Davis 4th among the UCs.

In 2011, U.S. News & World Report ranked UC Davis 9th among public national universities and 38th overall, in 2012 it was ranked 8th among public national universities, and in 2013 it was ranked 9th among public national universities.  This http://dateline.ucdavis.edu/dl_detail.php?id13641 Dateline article has more rankings for 2011.  Interestingly, in 2011 UCD was also ranked 38th in the World University Rankings by done by the Londonbased magazine Times Higher Education.

UC Davis is consistently ranked by the Sierra Clubs Sierra magazine as one of the top ten of Americas Coolest Schools  (an annual ranking of the greenest colleges in the United States).  In 2011, it was http://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/201109/coolschools/top10/slide8.aspx ranked #8.
