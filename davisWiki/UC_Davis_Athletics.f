UC Davis Athletics is currently in its third year of a Move to Division I  four year transition from NCAA Division II to NCAA Division I. The official school colors are yale blue and gold, the students are known as Aggies,  and the mascot is a mustang named Gunrock.

UC Davis kicked lots of butt in Division II, winning the NACDA Directors Cup six times before getting bored with that and deciding to make the jump to Division I.

UC Davis will join sister UCs, UC Irvine Irvine, UC Riverside Riverside, and UC Santa Barbara Santa Barbara in the Big West Conference. The Aggies will compete in the Great West Football Conference for Division IAA football, which features fellow California school, Cal Poly.

UC Davis also has some very good club teams, like Rugby, Crew, and Ice Hockey, just to name a few.

Admission is free for all UC Davis students.

 Awards
