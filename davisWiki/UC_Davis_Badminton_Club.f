The UC Davis Badminton Club welcomes all UCD students and employees who want to play badminton, from beginning to advanced skill levels.

The club members are provided with feather birdies and can play on 8 courts. Due to the success of the club and the large attendance, members play doubles and rotate so that everybody can play. With such system, every player gets to play several games a night.

Tournaments

The club hosts two open tournaments each year, the Fall Open and the Spring Open. Club members are required to pay a normal entry fee to play in those tournaments, but usually club members who participate in setting up and running the tournament can get full or partial reimbursements. The UC Davis Badminton Clubs Fall Open is coming up on Oct 25th and 26th, sign up now at www.ucdbadminton.com.

If I remember correctly, SPAC does not allow clubs to register as UC Davis ________ Club, I think it sounds too much like an endorsement. So wouldnt this be the Davis Badminton Club or the Badminton Club at UC Davis?
  From my understanding, they are not registered with SPAC. They are a sport club team and under the jurisdiction of the Sport Club council. Users/EmilyTung
The UCD badminton club, in its current sad state, is full of elitists and is not welcome to beginners and noob players at all. So dont join unless you are as elitist as they are.
