Watching the UC Davis Baseball team is a very enjoyable way of spending a Spring Quarter. It is free for students and the quality of baseball is very high. The Big West Conference is arguably the best conference in college baseball due to the talent of players residing in California. The Aggies games are fun because gift certificates to places like Habit Burger The Habit, InNOut, Davis Sport Shop, Redrum Burger, and Yogurt Shack are given out every few innings for every game. From time to time other promotions like TShirts and Sandwiches are given out. This helps improve the fan experience because the 2009 season was a rough one for the young Aggie team. They finished with a record of 1342 overall and 519 in conference. The official UC Davis interlocking baseball hats (custom fit) can be bought at Davis Sport Shop. The UCD Bookstore now sells them too. These hats are a nice way to show support for the Baseball team since the hats are unique for the team and they are the only ones who wear it (no mustang logo).

However, the poor record can be considered the Aggies being the victim of their own success. Before the 2009 season, the Aggies made the NCAA Tournament and had been a very good ballclub in previous seasons. The Aggies had many players, particularly pitchers drafted in the 2008 MLB Amateur Draft so in 2009 they were a younger team with less experience. However, they showed a lot of promise and came close to defeating some of the top teams in the county amid a very tough schedule. The Aggies Baseball team went into the 2010 season with many more returning ballplayers. The Aggies improved on their 2009 record (though their 09 record was pretty bad) and the 2010 season featured several great games. The Aggies were 20 against Cal: an 80 Winter Qaurter road win at Cal and another at home against the Bears in spring qaurter, this time a walkoff 65 win.  The final record was 2629, nearly doubling the previous seasons total. A lot of excitement at Dobbins baseball field Dobbins Stadium will be sure to unfold in the coming years as the team matures and continues to have the great coaching from manager Rex Peters.
