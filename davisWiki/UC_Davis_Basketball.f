The UC Davis Basketball program began in 1910. Their top rival is the University of Pacific, the only private school in the Big West. They are also the Aggies traveling partner in scheduling. UC Davis also plays a home/road set of games each year with Sacramento State. Home games are played the Pavilion (@Hamilton Court). Mens and Womens basketball usually starts at the begining of November with one or two exhibition games for both teams, before the season starts. Often, the games in Fall Qaurter will be nonconference games. Nearly almost all games in Winter Qaurter (with a few exceptions) will be Big West contests. The top 8(?) of 9 teams go to the Big West Tournament in Anaheim, then the lowest teams will play each other in the opening rounds. The top 2 teams have 2 byes up to the semifinals. The #3 and #4 seeds each recieve one bye (If the womens tournament is different, please add it).
