At UC Davis the Chancellor is the highest ranking position on campus. The Chancellor works directly with the Board of Vice Chancellors and serves as the face of the university to the rest of the world.

The Sacramento Bee described the significance of this position in a http://www.sacbee.com/2010/09/20/3041764/ucdavischancellorkatehihas.html#ixzz106IrgE5v recent profile on Linda Katehi: As top boss of UC Davis, she leads the secondlargest employer in the Sacramento region. The only guy in town with more employees is Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Among the benefits of the job are housing in the form of The Chancellors House the Chancellors House on College Park.  He or she oversees the other UCD Administrative Officers.

20080319 21:59:06 nbsp Larry Vanderhoefs gross is $305,841, according to the Sacramento Bee. For a rough comparison, Stanford President John Hennessy gets an annual salary of $566,581 and USC President Steven Sample receives $605,086. Users/JeremyOgul
   Just to chime in with another data point, President Graham Spanier of Penn State made $545,016 base salary for 20062007.  That was reported as being the third highest for any public university in the US.  I cant seem to find a nice table allowing Venderhoefs salary to be compared to other universities.
     Yeah, I found out while poking around for this info that the Chronicle of Higher Education publishes a big list of executive compensation packages at private universities. Unfortunately their website is not accessible for free, even through the library, so at some point Im going to have to go down to the library and find the hard copy. I do find this stuff really interesting.  Jeremy
        The Penn State salary was a result of a fairly nasty and very controversial lawsuit to get the University to publish salaries (Penn State is a oddball semipublic, semiprivate institution).  Even then, many people think that number is not complete (as there are other figures whose salaries dont include known income).  It seems that the payrate of upper level administration at many institutions, public and private, is a difficult thing to obtain.  There was some comparison in local Penn State news to the other Big Ten Universities, and not all of those have figures available.  At the very least, the UC system should be lauded for publishing their figures (which, as a public system, they should, IMO).  Users/JabberWokky jw
          Well to be more accurate, the Sacramento Bee should be praised for making the information so readily available. Im not aware that UC actually publishes it; its just public information that you have to request, unless someone like the Bee has already done that for you. Users/JeremyOgul Jeremy
