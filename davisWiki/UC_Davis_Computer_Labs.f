There are a bunch of computer labs all around Campus campus.  Some labs, like the ones in the Shields_Computer_Lab Shields Library, are managed by http://clm.ucdavis.edu CLM  meaning any UCD student can use them (they require a login/password).  There are other labs that require you to be a member of a certain department or group, such as the ones in Kerr Hall.

These general computer labs are manned by Computer Room Consultants Computer Room Consultants or CRCs and managed by IET  http://clm.ucdavis.edu Computer Lab Management(CLM).

CLMs labs are divided into three types of labs: Open Access (never have classes scheduled in them), Classroom Labs (classes are scheduled here, but the room is open to students when classes are not using them), and Media Labs (contain media equipment and software).
