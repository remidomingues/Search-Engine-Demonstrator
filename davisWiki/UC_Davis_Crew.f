UC Davis Mens Crew is a member of the Western Intercollegiate Rowing Association (WIRA) and competes both regionally and nationally. The team has distinguished itself as a perennial powerhouse in the WIRA conference, with numerous WIRA medals in all the major boat categories. Additionally, the team has grown more of a national presence, with appearances at Head of the Charles in Boston, IRA national championships in New Jersey, ECACs and ACRA club national championships in Oklahoma.

The mens crew is a club (nonfunded) sport, and the majority of the oarsmen are walkon, with no prior rowing experience before joining the team.

The team operates via a combination of limited support from the university, alumni and parent donations, and athlete dues/fundraising. Athletes pay dues on a quarterly basis, plus fundraisers throughout the year. A council consisting of teamelected athletes runs the team, making decisions ranging from hiring coaches to hammering out the annual budget.
