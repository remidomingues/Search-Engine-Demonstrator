Research Participants Needed for Childrens Study (Ages 315)

Researchers from the UC Davis University of California, Davis are conducting a study concerning young childrens learning. We are looking for children ages 315 without any emotional, physical, or cognitive disabilities and their primary caretakers to participate. The children and caretakers must be fluent in English.

The studies involve one university visit for the caretaker and child. The families are compensated with a monetary reward and the children receive a small toy.
