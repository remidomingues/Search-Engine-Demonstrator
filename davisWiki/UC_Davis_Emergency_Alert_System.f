After the Virginia Tech massacre, pretty much every college in the U.S. decided they wanted an emergency alert system.  UC Davis has just started using http://www.ucdavis.edu/help/questions_and_answers.html an alert system.

The first use of this system occurred on March 5, 2008.  Apparently, Mark Woods a resident in Terceros Tercero D Building D Building had some explosives, which led them to evacuate the entire building.  The following Warnme warning was issued:

  There was an incident at Tercero Residence Hall last night.  Our Fire and Police Departments have the situation under control and there is no threat to the campus. Classes and business will continue as usual. Additional information will be posted at http://www.ucdavis.edu/.

The system was activated again on April 22, 2009 as an annual test.

Text messages come from 24639.

Warning after the fact  is that really helpful?  Users/BrentLaabs
