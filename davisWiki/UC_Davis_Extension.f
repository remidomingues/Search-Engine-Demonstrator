20081217 18:08:51 nbsp What exactly is this extension? I dont get it. The website was confusing, and the registrarhelp (which is horrible) simply referred to it as the extension. Is it in greater Sacramento like the website says? Users/ThanhVu

20081217 18:20:19 nbsp UC Davis Extension focuses on continuing and professional development courses.  The courses are typically offered as single classes or they can be taken as a program to receive a certificate in a particular discipline. As their site indicates, classes include such topics as graphic design, project management, brewing and business management.  The courses are offered via online or in a classroom setting or in a combination of both.  Classes are offered in Sacramento where UCD Extension has classroom facilities.  In the distant learning online courses I have taken in Project Management I have had fellow students from around the United Stats as well as from other countries.  I would say the extension means extending your education beyond your BA/MA to secure additional training for a specific purpose. Users/loneshark

20101110 12:55:50 nbsp Ive received test proctoring services from the UCDext for over the last year. Because I am distance learning student, I expect the service to be flexible; often requiring me to make last minute, makeshift changes. Each time I need to reschedule something, or if I even inquire about changing my appointment date/times, I get some of the rudest treatment ever. My exams get scheduled for periods of 23 hours, and I tell them I will only be in for the last hour of the exam because thats all the time I need. They tell me that its fine when I do that, but then they give me so much attitude for it the next time I do so. It really drives me nuts. They told me today to go and seek a new test proctor. If there were any near me, I would have done that a long time ago. Now I guess Im forced to find a new one because Im practically being refused service beyond today. I was told that Im causing them to lose recurrent customers, which makes no sense because Ive been a recurrent customer for them for the last year and a half. Paying $20 with each exam I take. I bring them a decent amount of money by taking my exams here, but if this is the treatment I get for it. Forget it! Users/ThUn
