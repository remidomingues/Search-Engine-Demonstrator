What Is UC Davis Fall Welcome:
Fall Welcome is the time period from the beginning of September to the UC Davis Homecoming football game. For fall 2011 this time period is September 1  October 15, 2011. During this time campus organizations and departments hold events to help new students transition to life at UC Davis. The Fall Welcome Planning Committee is made up of UC Davis students and staff who aim to provide opportunities for all students (new and current) to engage in the campus community and participate in the historical traditions of UC Davis. All students are encouraged to look at the Fall Welcome webpage (http://fallwelcome.ucdavis.edu) for a list of events.  The calendar portion of the Fall Welcome page goes live in early august.

Website Features
Some features of the website, in addition to the Fall Welcome Event Calendar, are links to new student resources.   Created by students, for students, links are organized into the following categories:

1. New Student Resources  The Fall Welcome committee assembled a list of resources to help new UC Davis students get involved and acclimated to the campus.  (You can also check out the Freshman Guide here on the wiki)
2. What Is an Aggie?  Students new to UC Davis, at some point, must ask an important question: What is an Aggie?
3. Get Involved!  There are many opportunities at UC Davis to get involved. Look through the following list for organizations youd like to become involved with, check out their websites, and contact them to get involved.
