UC DAVIS Farmers Market News

The East Quad Farmerâ€™s Market has been rebranded as the UC Davis Farmers Market and relaunched this Spring Quarter at a new location at the Silo Union.  In addition to providing fresh produce from local farmers, the new and improved market brings food options outside to the market to create a lunch time destination.


The UC Davis Farmers Market is designed to promote student health as well as local and UCD food products. It is a seasonal oncampus extension of the Davis Farmers Market. It runs each Wednesday of fall and spring quarters from 11:00 am to 1:30 pm, weather permitting.

The UC Davis Farmers Market developed from a collaboration between a number of campus partners in an effort to increase access to fresh, local produce for busy UC Davis students, staff and faculty during fall and spring quarters. A 2011 survey of UC Davis students found that over 60% eat two or fewer servings of fruits and vegetables a day. The UC Davis Farmers Market offers an easy and convenient way for the UCD community to incorporate more nutritionpacked fruits and vegetables into their diet. The campus is operated under the umbrella of multiple sponsoring departments including Student Health & Counseling Services Health Education & Promotion, ASUCD Environmental Policy and Planning Commission, UC Davis Stores, Campus Recreation and Unions, Davis Farmers Market Association, Davis Food Coop, Coffee House, and UC Davis Dining services to make this a possibility.

Every Wednesday morning the market occurs, UC Davis Dining Services sends out a weekly email to members of a listserve to give a brief reminder of the date and time of the market. It also includes nutritional data on some of the produce available and quick, easy recipes. To sign up for this listserve managed by UC Davis Dining Services, contact srkosoff@ucdavis.edu.
