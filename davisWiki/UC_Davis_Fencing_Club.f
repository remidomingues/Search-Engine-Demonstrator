We are a sports club whose primary purposes are to teach and promote the Olympic sport of fencing. In addition to fencing skills and competition, we emphasize basics, safety and respect to our traditions and to our fellow members, officers and coach. It is also our goal to provide club members with a social evironment which provides adequate reason to eat lots of pizza and play glowinthedark frisbee from time to time, never losing sight of our ultimate goal of dominating our dread rivals, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.

UCDFC welcomes everyone  especially new people who just want to try fencing; you bring yourself, well provide everything else: training, traditions and equipment. If you are already an experienced fencer, youre also welcome; the skills and talent you bring will enrich everyones experience at the salle.

Originally founded in 1954, the UCDFC is the oldest of all the sports clubs at UCD, and the fastestgrowing. UCDFC is a member of both the http://www.usfencing.org/ United States Fencing Association and the http://nadi.calpoly.edu/~fencing/icfencer/ Northern California Intercollegiate Fencing League, and is host for the seasonfinishing Davis Fencing Tournament each April. This tournament sees both individuals and teams compete in all weapons for both sexes, and covers an entire weekend. The 20052006 season will see the inception of the NorCal Championship Cup, which will be awarded to the college or university fencing team with the best over all showing at years end.

Many advanced UCDFC fencers are members of the USFA and compete in the Bay Cup Circuit, widely recognized as one of the most challenging fencing circuits in the United States.

  The shirt is unfortunately made by SportTek and is of a ridiculously low quality. My first experience with their shirts was while marching when we were required to buy one for twenty dollars to wear under our uniforms. It gave me a rash and got smelly rather easily. I replaced it with athletic shirts from WalMart for five dollars each and they lasted pretty long and were very comfortable. Then I started wearing the UCD Fencing one. After a few wears, it would smell moldy even after a wash. I ended up throwing it away. I am not sure how well they manage for nonathletic use. Users/hankim Han Kim, now an Under Amour label whore
