20100311 09:57:37 nbsp The pancake breakfast is a really great event.  I didnt go in 2009, but Ive gone several other times.  Its a great fundraiser for Relay, the foods good (although one year they screwed up the potatoes pretty bad... how, I have no idea), and its always a lot of fun. Users/TomGarberson
