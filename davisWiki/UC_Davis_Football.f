Past Seasons

2005

In 2005, the Aggie Football team took part in arguably the greatest upset in college football history by beating the Stanford Cardinal in their stadium. Home football games are the epitome of the college experience   see the http://ucdavisaggies.cstv.com/sports/mfootbl/sched/ucdamfootblsched.html schedule to find out when the next game is.

For a recap of the completely unexpected upset of Stanfurd (come on Perry, get the spelling right!), as well as video highlights (more like a documentary), check out http://www.ucdavis.edu/spotlight/0905/ags_stun_stanford.html this link.  This impressive win against Stanford developed quite a reputation for UCDs first season.  When Stanfords crowd started chanting Upset at the Stanford v. Cal rivalry game, Bears fans replied by chanting UC Davis.  Throughout 2006, there seems to be a surprising amount of enthusiasm about Davis Football at UC Berkeley Cal.

2006

The Aggies completed the 2006 season by keeping the consecutive winning streak alive and finishing 65. 2006 was an was a season with its highs and lows. The Ags suffered set backs in close losses to Cal Poly and North Dakota State, but ended the season on a high note by defeating Sac State and  the University of San Diego.

The 2006 season will be remembered as the last season played at Toomey Field. It was also the last season UC Davis played before officially joining the ranks of Division 1.

Student attendance during the 2006 season was at an all time high during the school year. Capacity  Aggie Pack crowds filled Toomey field with noise and of course tube socks.

2007

The Aggies embark on a new era in 2007.  With a new stadium, new uniforms, and becoming Division I excitement around the program was high. Season tickets sales were at an all time high, and sell outs are expected at Aggie Stadium sometime this century.

2008

2009

The Aggies beat North Dakota 2820 to take the Great West Conference Championship, and finished with a 65 record, losing the Causeway Classic to Sacramento State.
