 Faculty 
 Robert Borgen  teaches some of the upper division, notably JPN 141
 Chianing Chang  Department Chair. Knows his stuff, but difficult and not very popular among students.
 Kazue Chavez  A very nice grandmother type who mainly teaches core language classes. Makes a mean California roll.
 David Gundry
 Junko Ito
 Mayumi Saito
 Haruko Sakakibara
 Ritsuko Shigeyama  Also often likened by students to ones grandma. Married name is Heath, due to a recent Dept. of Homeland Security measure, Heath must appear in all formal UC Davis listings, but she still goes by Shigeyama, causing confusion to those new to the department. Also mainly teaches core language classes.
 Joseph Sorensen  Currently the major academic advisor. Teaches some of the upper division classes (outside of the 111112113 series).
 Miyo Uchida  Teaches core language courses of various levels. Has a mean, narcissistic, and sometimes risque sense of humor, but in a good way. Has maybe a heavier workload than some, but very entertaining.
