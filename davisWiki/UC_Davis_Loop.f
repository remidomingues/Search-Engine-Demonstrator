The UC Davis Loop is comprised of La Rue, California Avenue, Russell Russell Blvd., A Street and Old Davis Road.

The Loop circles core Campus campus. There are traffic barriers that keep the majority of traffic flow out of the center of campus and as a result the loop carries much of the campus traffic.

Do not confuse the UC Davis Loop with uloop, a commercial website.
