The UC Davis Health System is located on the Sacramento campus of UC Davis, and is the home to the UC Davis Medical Center (the hospital), the http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/nursing/ Betty Irene Moore School of Nursing, and the School of Medicine UC Davis School of Medicine. It is one of five hospitals in the UC System and in 2011 was http://health.usnews.com/besthospitals/universityofcaliforniadavismedicalcenter6932680 ranked within the top fifty nationwide in several different specialties. UC Davis Medical Center is the only combination adult and pediatric http://www.emsa.ca.gov/ems_systems_division_trauma_level_overview Level I trauma center for Northern California and averages about 4,000 trauma patients per year, making it the #5 trauma center nationally. They also have a burn center and the PHUR program, which allows certified dogs to visit patients.

In addition, http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/medicalcenter/cliniclocations/ the UC Davis Medical Group, a primarycare, outpatient oriented collection of medical facilities, has offices throughout the Sacramento area, UCD Medical Group including one in Davis. These facilities give the surrounding community access to primary care and some specialist appointments that do not need to take place at the main hospital.

The http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/common/includes/shared/map/images/UCDavisSacramentoCampusMap.pdf Health System campus is vast and consists of http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/medschool/departments/ numerous academic departments spread throughout the campus. Specialty clinics such as The MIND Institute and UC Davis Cancer Center Cancer Center offer specialized resources and practices. Inside the hospital there is a gift shop and a coffee shop (adjacent to the main hospital lobby); downstairs in the main hospital there is a cafeteria. The UC Davis Medical Center Bookstore is located just across the street from the hospital. The lobby and other areas of the main hospital now have free public WiFi. Please keep in mind that the use of cell phones, including WiFienabled phones, is currently prohibited in most patient care areas of the hospital.

Many premeds do internships every quarter at various departments. Sign ups are by online lottery at the http://icc.ucdavis.edu ICC webpage. You can set up your time with your contact. Most people pick Fridays when they have time, which really overwhelms the staff to have so many pesky students around. An internship requires 40 hours a quarter, but if your papers are legit nobody at South Hall will know and nobody at the med center will care.

UC Davis affiliates can get to the Med Center by riding the UCDMC Bus Line UCDMC Shuttle or http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/parking/transportation/index.html MedTransit shuttles. Make sure you tell the driver which stop you want, or youll be driving in circles.






20110421 00:18:54 nbsp I wonder why there is no mention of their satellite in Davis on Covell near Lake blvd in NW Davis. I have my PCP in UC Davis Medical Group and I (and everyone back home I have told about my treatment there) have been very impressed, both at the Davis location and the Sacramento location. I would never willingly consider medical service from another group; too bad I dont have a choice when returning to my own country. Users/MichaelNielsen

20110918 16:14:37 nbsp I have to say is that the food at the cafeteria is much cheaper than the food at the UC Davis main campus. I personally dont think taking the bus/driving to the hospital for internship is worth it, the career center makes it so much more exciting and important than it really is (many of my friends and interns agrees). In the near future,I am going to try Sutter Hospital instead. Users/kkha91

20111206 18:33:02 nbsp I tried making more clear the distinction between the UCD Health System (the broadest entity, encompassing all of the Sacramento campus), the Medical Center (just the hospital), and the two schools, the Nursing and Medical schools. What MichaelN is referring to is an entirely different entity, called the UC Davis Medical Group, which is more primarycare oriented, and has various locations throughout the Sacramento area.
