This branch of the UC Davis Bookstore has lots of medical books, and also carries medical supplies including stethoscopes, diagnostic sets, medical bags, anatomical models, and medical posters.  They also carry scrubs in many different styles, so Im seeing lots of lastminute costumes Halloween potential.  Theres also a bunch of UCD Health System and UCD School of Medicine shwag the perfect gift for parents who dont know youve dropped out of medical school.
