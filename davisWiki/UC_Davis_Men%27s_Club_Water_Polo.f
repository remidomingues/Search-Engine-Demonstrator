Fall 2006 Season WrapUp
We finished 2nd overall in the Pacific Coast division of the CWPA.  At the Pacific Coast Championship tournament UC Davis did something that no other team in the history of the CWPA has done and that is being a 9th seed who played in the Championship game and almost won.  We beat 4th seed Cal Maritime 156, 3rd seed UCLA 87, 2nd seed UCSD 53, and took the 1st seed Cal Poly to overtime, where we did hold the lead but unfortunately did not come out on top.

Congratulations to David Pursell who was named Pacific Coast Division CoPlayers of the Week for his performance at the division championship on November 45 at Cal Poly.  Click here to see the  http://www.collegiatewaterpolo.org/html/0607News/11606MCLUBPOW.htm article.
