Appellate Advocacy Class
Each fall semester, a majority of the School of Law law school’s second year students participate in Appellate Advocacy (commonly called Moot Court) as an elective, attending lectures on appellate skills and participating in a series of practice oral arguments. The course in the fall culminates in the law school’s annual Intraschool Moot Court Competition, in which the students participate in appellate arguments which are judged and critiqued by dozens of local attorneys and judges who volunteer their time. Students who continue Appellate Advocacy in the spring semester focus their attention on appellate brief writing. The top students each year are selected to participate in the law schools annual Neumiller Competition, the final round of the law school’s Moot Court Competition, which takes place each year during the UC Davis Picnic Day celebration. The Moot Court program, including the Appellate Advocacy Class, has recently come under the direction of Todd Noonan and Kurt Kappes.  It was previously directed by Tim Schooley, the supervising attorney at the Court of Appeals for the Third District in Sacramento.

Asylum & Refugee Law National Moot Court Competition
The UC Davis http://students.law.ucdavis.edu/mootcourt/Asylum_About.html Asylum & Refugee Law National Moot Court Competition is the only immigration law moot court competition on the west coast, and the only one in the nation devoted exclusively to the topic of asylum and refugee law. The competition provides law students from across the country the opportunity to participate in a hypothetical appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. Competitors will write a brief as either respondent or petitioner on an issue related to asylum and refugee law. Shortly after submitting their briefs, students will participate in oral debates arguing for both sides of the issue. Students’ briefs and oral arguments will be judged by prominent judges, attorneys and scholars that specialize in the areas of immigration law and/or appellate advocacy.
