The UC Davis Police Department is part of the UC Police. The UC Davis Police are not part of the Davis Police Department but they have a mutual aid agreement, similar to the agreement they both have with neighboring cities like Woodland and West Sacramento. Considering that campus is not part of the City of Davis, it makes sense that it would have a separate police department.

In addition to enforcing the law at Campus UC Davis and the UC Davis Medical Center, the UCD Police provide the campus lost and found, Livescan finger printing services (livescan) (but only for UCrelated jobs) , patrol ridealong, and personal safety education through Campus Violence Prevention Program CVPP. The Aggie Hosts, a student policing program, provides a free Campus Safety Escort Service.  To use this service call 7521727.  Note that this is not part of the police force, but rather part of Campus Security, a separate organization.

The UC Davis campus is where you have the best chance of encountering UCDs scooter cop.

On May 18th, 2005 Annette Spicuzza was sworn in as Chief of Police, replacing Calvin Handy. The job has a salary of $125,000 a year. She was the first female chief at UCD, although Captain Rita Spaur was acting chief before accepting the position of Chief at UC Merced earlier.

On November 21, 2011 Chief Annette Spicuzza was http://www.news.ucdavis.edu/search/news_detail.lasso?id10a086 placed on administrative leave in the aftermath of the November 18, 2011 UC Davis Police Response to Occupy UC Davis pepperspraying of student protesters on November 18 by Lt. John Pike and one other officer.  Matt Carmichael UC Davis Police Lt. Matt Carmichael was appointed interim Police Chief; on April 29, 2012, after Spicuzza retired following the release of the Reynoso report, Carmichael was made Chief for one year.

7521230 would be a very good number for cell phone users to program into their phones. Also 7583600 for noncampus emergencies. When you dial 911 from a cell phone, you are connected with a CHP dispatcher who generally has no idea whats going on. It will significantly reduce the emergency response time if you call dispatch directly.

ASUCD created the ASUCD StudentPolice Relations Committee to create sustained dialogues between students and both police departments. As part of the subcommittee work, the UC Davis Police Department answered a list of frequently asked student questions of the police  FAQ StudentPolice.

 Crime Log 

The department maintains a http://police.ucdavis.edu/crime/CrimeLogFolder daily crime log on their web site.

 Citizens Academy 
The department periodically offers a Citizens Police Academy to the general public to improve relations with and educate the general public.

 Fatal Incidents 

On Dec. 14, 2004, UC Davis police shot and killed Tragic events Martin Louie Castro Soriano, a 26year old visitor from wiki:WikiPedia:Antioch%2C_California Antioch, outside of Regan Main. Soriano, who was high on Tweakers meth, had shot at the cops when they attempted to subdue him with a wiki:WikiPedia:Taser Taser. The police were cleared of wrongdoing.

 Complaints 

UC police have the same kind of legal protection as state troopers, which makes them incredibly difficult to sue for issues of police misconduct. (CA Penal Code sec. 830.2(b) )
This is due to the fact that they ARE state troopers (what better location to stage state troopers than the University of California UC system scattered thru Cali...) One could pull you over in LA for a traffic infraction and be legally justified in doing so. Even though they have oodles of power, they are rarely itching to use it and have been known to refuse assistance requests from DPD when asked to go handle something in el macero. UCD cops mainly stay on or very close to campus  Users/StevenDaubert

 History 
Walter W. Wadman was the first UCD Police officer.
  Police Misconduct Stories

 Homophobia 

Reported on February 3, 2009 a police officer was fired for being openly gay:

  Calvin Chang, who is openly gay, says his dream of being an officer is over.

  Basically, they destroyed me, he said. All I wanted to be was a police officer all my life.

  Chang says those dreams are gone after what allegedly happened at the UC Davis Police Department, his former employer. In a lawsuit filed this week, he claims his supervisor called him derogatory names.

  My own supervisor referred to me as a fing fag, Chang said.

  Chang was initially fired by UC Davis Police in 2003. His managers told him he was a highrisk officer because of three car accidents. He was reinstated after an investigation, and then fired again last spring over allegations that he failed to have a backup officer during a search.

 Violence Against Protesters 
On November 18, 2011, campus police used pepper spray and force to disperse seated, peaceful protesters on the Quad.  Coverage of the incident is detailed more fully November 18, 2011 UC Davis Police Response to Occupy UC Davis here  not to mention in the national and international press.


20111119 03:18:23 nbsp After the way the UCD Police Department brutalized students during the UC Davis Occupy Protest on November 18, 2011, I have no idea how anyone in the community could ever trust these police with ensuring our safety ever again. The videos/pictures were horrifying to watch. Users/ThUn
  Would there be any use in requesting that all those involved in the attack be immediately dismissed from the service?  Users/BarnabasTruman
  That would be somewhat reassuring, but based on the responses from the UCDPD and Katehi, they are justifying the police brutality under the facade of concern for student health and safety. Truthfully, if that is the logic, the 24hour study room should be closed down because you have students occupying that area for days at a time on certain occasions. I do not see how students sleeping in tents on the public quad area for more than a day poses health and safety risks for others. Users/ThUn

20111119 16:53:01 nbsp In 2004 I was stopped on Russell Boulevard by one UC Davis motorcycle policeman and two other UC Davis policemen in squad cars.  The reason for stopping me I found out was that that the ignition switch was dangling from the steering column.  They asked that I get out of the car and walk to the back of the car.  I was cooperating, but one of them grabbed my wrist with enough force that I was asked why I was wincing.  They seemed to have a sadistic streak.  Not long afterwards the UC Davis Police killed a man by Regan Hall on December 14, 2004.  I figured that outcome was likely in a serious situation involving this police department.  It sure would be nice if this department was totally decent. Users/BruceHansen

20120116 20:27:57 nbsp Ive never had a good experience with these guys. they dont have good people skills and seem to think ridicule is standard procedure when dealing with cooperative citizens in question. DPD on the other hand has USUALLY been pretty tight though, with very few exceptions, at least in my experiences.  Users/Aaronfurtek

20120322 09:49:40 nbsp Im still waiting for more info from UCD, but it looks like UC Davis Police be implementing a Bait Bike program, similar to the controversial show Bait Car as a way of deterring bike thieves. Interesting approach. Insurance for the bike ($681.40) was approved by ASUCD. Ill add info to the Wiki as I get more concrete info on this story. http://patch.com/ArLCP Users/justincox22
