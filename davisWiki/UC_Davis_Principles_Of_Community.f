The UC Davis Principles of Community is the statement of intent describing how UCD intends to treat the community of the University:

  The University of California, Davis, is first and foremost an institution of learning and teaching, committed to serving the needs of society. Our campus community reflects and is a part of a society comprising all races, creeds and social circumstances. The successful conduct of the universitys affairs requires that every member of the university community acknowledge and practice the following basic principles:

  We affirm the inherent dignity in all of us, and we strive to maintain a climate of justice marked by respect for each other. We acknowledge that our society carries within it historical and deeprooted misunderstandings and biases, and therefore we will endeavor to foster mutual understanding among the many parts of our whole.

  We affirm the right of freedom of expression within our community and also affirm our commitment to the highest standards of civility and decency towards all. We recognize the right of every individual to think and speak as dictated by personal belief, to express any idea, and to disagree with or counter anothers point of view, limited only by university regulations governing time, place and manner. We promote open expression of our individuality and our diversity within the bounds of courtesy, sensitivity and respect.

  We confront and reject all manifestations of discrimination, including those based on race, ethnicity, gender, age, disability, sexual orientation, religious or political beliefs, status within or outside the university, or any of the other differences among people which have been excuses for misunderstanding, dissension or hatred. We recognize and cherish the richness contributed to our lives by our diversity. We take pride in our various achievements, and we celebrate our differences.

  We recognize that each of us has an obligation to the community of which we have chosen to be a part. We will strive to build a true community of spirit and purpose based on mutual respect and caring.

They also have a quarterly book reading selection to promote the Principles of Community. The idea is to get people to read books that broaden their cultural horizons and give students, staff and faculty a common point of interest/discussion.

Among the authors was Professor Charles Nash.

On the back of some Reg Cards, the principles are quoted as

  We affirm the dignity inherent in all of us, and we... will strive to build a true community of spirit and purpose based on mutual respect and caring.
