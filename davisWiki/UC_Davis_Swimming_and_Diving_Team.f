The UC Davis Swimming and Diving Team is an intercollegiate swimming and diving team.

It is currently for women only, the mens team having been cut in 2010 along with other UC Davis Budget Cuts.  The team practices at Schaal Aquatics Center, which was purposely built for a swimming and diving team before the funding cut, yet it mysteriously lacks diving platforms and bubbles. Despite the mens team winning the division the year they were cut. Despite them being good enough to produce an Olympic Athletes Olympic athlete, Scott Weltz.  Yay regents go ags.
