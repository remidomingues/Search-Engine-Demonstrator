http://www.hr.ucdavis.edu/Emp/TES Temporary Employment Services (TES) was organized in 1961 to provide employees to fill the temporary staffing needs of campus departments and the UC Davis Health System in Sacramento. They are located at 207 3rd Street. TES is associated with Employment and Outreach Services, a unit in the Division of Human Resources. Employees with a variety of skills are available on short notice for assignments to departments when regular staff are ill or on vacation, for special projects, during peak workload periods, or to temporarily fill a staff vacancy.

If you are adaptable and enjoy the challenge of learning new tasks and working in different environments on each new assignment, then you are right for TES. As a temporary employee, you can become acquainted with many different departments and acquire knowledge and skills unique to the University environment.
