Tennis on Campus Club of the Year

The USTA Tennis On Campus program announced its inaugural Club of the Year Award for the 20082009 Tennis On Campus season, awarding the prestigious title to the  University of California, Davis Club Tennis Team . In addition,  Lone Star College  CyFair Club Tennis Team , University of Wisconsin, Whitewater Club Tennis Team  and  UCLA Club Tennis Team  received honorable mentions.

The USTA Tennis On Campus Club of the Year Award honors a Tennis On Campus club for significant improvements in their program and how it commits time and resources to benefit its community. This year’s winner, UC Davis, is a closeknit, 90% selffinanced, and diverse club of over 250 recreational and competitive players whose goal is to spread the joys of tennis through volunteering and mentoring. For its impact on the Davis community at large, the UC Davis Club holds a number of charitable events per year and has strong partnerships with local businesses. For example, the club partners with the USTA to provide a free clinic to over 400 underprivileged kids every year. In addition, the team offers a membership card which allows for discounts at local Davis merchandisers.  The UC Davis Club Team was honored earlier this year at the USTA Northern California Heroes Banquet as the 2008 Outstanding Tennis on Campus Program.

“It is remarkable to see how many of these studentled programs commit their time, energy and resources to improving their local communities,” said Glenn Arrington, USTA Tennis On Campus National Program Manager. “It was a very difficult decision because so many of our teams are great ambassadors not just for tennis, but also their campuses. In the end, the team from University of California, Davis stood out from the crowd, and they should be proud of their achievements.”

The USTA Tennis On Campus program will present the University of California, Davis the Club of the Year award during the  2009 USTA National Campus Championship , to be held April 1618, 2009 at the awardwinning Surprise Tennis & Racquet Complex in Surprise, Arizona.
