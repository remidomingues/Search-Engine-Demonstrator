The UC Davis Triathlon Team (“UCD Tri” for short) offers Triathlons triathlon and multisport racing opportunities as well as noncompetitive training. Members train for and compete in triathlons, duathlons, marathons, open water swims, cycling centuries, and more.

In the 20102011 school year, UCD Tri had approximately 120 members on its roster. Membership costs $125 and is restricted to UC Davis undergraduate and graduate students. The team welcomes athletes of all ability levels, ranging from complete beginner to advanced triathlete.

UC Davis faculty and staff and Davis residents who are interested in training for triathlons may want to contact the Davis Mad Cows Racing Team. UCD Tri and the Mad Cows have an excellent relationship, often cooperating on workouts, social events, and race organization. Several UCD students are members of both the UCD Tri and the Mad Cows.


Training

During Fall, Winter, and Spring Quarters, swim practices are held MondayFriday from 45 PM at Hickey Pool. For bicycling cycling and Places to Walk or Run running practices and other activities, members use an online workout calendar found http://www.ucdtri.com/calendar.php here to coordinate meeting times and locations. All members are allowed to (and encouraged to) post their own workouts. In this manner, any member can fit triathlon training into a busy schedule. There are no required practices, but the team stresses that “you get out what you put in”.

Daily team responsibilities are managed completely by UC Davis students. However, for training, the team seeks advice from John Hansen. Coach John writes bimonthly newsletters and creates monthly training calendars. He also coaches 23 workouts per week, a Wednesday swim and track workout and a weekend BRick (any 2/3 sports in one workout, often a BikeRun), cycling, or running workout. The rest of the swim workouts are lead by student workout coordinators.

The team also hosts a variety of clinics designed to teach members about various topics, including Bike Church/Flat Bicycle Tire Repair fixing a flat tire, general bike maintenance, race nutrition, preparing your transition area, swim technique, etc. Members can always submit suggestions to Coach John and to officers as to what clinics they want. Talking to Coach John and to older members is also a great resource, especially for beginner triathletes!

Nervous about competing in a real triathlon? UCD Tri also puts on a mock tri for members. This fun event gives aspiring triathletes the practice and confidence to compete in the upcoming race season! Also, members are encouraged to write race reports. These sometimes lengthy (but witty) emails are sent over the listserve and commemorate the writers races, including funny (sometimes embarrassing) moments and lessons learned. Some of these reports can be accessed http://www.ucdtri.com/raceReport.php here.


Social

UCD Tri is not “all work and no play”. Members do a variety of activities outside of training/competing. Such events include BBQs and team dinners, camping, and an annual ski trip. The team is famous for its Paper Plate Awards given out at the endoftheyear picnic.
