The UC Davis Undie Run 07 took place on May 18. Orchestrated over facebook, the event attracted an approximate 150200 participants, though the facebook group boasted 815 members. The undie clad mob took a ten minutelong jaunt in the vicinity of the Memorial Union, ending at the starting point on The Quad. The original plan to follow a course through downtown fell through after UC Davis Police Department campus police warned that the crowd would be obstructing traffic. Despite the diverted plan, the run appeared to have been a success, and all were merry. The end.
