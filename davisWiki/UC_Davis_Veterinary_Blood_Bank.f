Canine Blood Donors


A communitybased canine blood donor program started in February 2008 and has been a great success. Canine blood donation functions similar to a human blood donation, with one exception: the donors are screened at an initial exam, and then return to donate once all of their tests have been cleared. The whole donation process, from checkin to wrapup, takes about 30 minutes. Dogs are asked to sit quietly during donation, but are not sedated. They have given lots of love and hugs, and many many treats after donation!

We are, and will always be, looking for canine blood donors.

Requirements for donation: Dogs must be: 18 years old, 55+ pounds, current on flea/heartworm/tick preventative medications and of good temperament.

If your dog is interested in saving lives, please give us a call at 5307521393 (options 31) MondayFriday, 8am5pm. Appointments cannot be made via email.
