UC Davis Wastewater Treatment Plant is a truly unexciting place located south of Interstate 80 I80 on Old Davis Road (address???). It is in south campus, technically a part of Solano County. The treatment plant can be seen from the Train Tracks train tracks which run right next to it. If youre in to waste water, this place is for you.

The current plant first opened in March of 2000 at a cost of $15.3 million, and it was quite advanced at the time. The facility utilizes ultraviolet light as part of its disinfection process. It is also worthy to note that an APS Digester anaerobic phased solids digester was built; it takes solid organic waste and turns it into electricity and fiber products. The facility can treat up to 2.8 million gallons of waste per day. When the water has been processed, it is tested to make sure it meets guidelines and then released into Putah Creek  The current plant replaced an older one that had been in operation for over 50 years next to the arboretum and the Cole Facility.

This treatment plant serves only the campus community. See Waste Water Treatment Plant to learn about the plant that serves the City of Davis.
