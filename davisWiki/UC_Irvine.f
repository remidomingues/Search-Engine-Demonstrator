wiki:irvine:UC Irvine is one of the newer UC System UC campuses and is noted for having the highest Asians Asian enrollment rate among the UC System UCs, for which it is sometimes known as the University of Chinese Immigrants, Under Chinese Invasion, (and sometimes the University of Civics and Integras.) Three UCI professors have won Nobel Prizes in recent years. UCI is the first university in the world to have two professors win Nobels in different areas in the same year. UCI is home to the first http://www.ics.uci.edu School of Computer Science  among the UCs, and is a leader in that discipline. The university is also quite distinguished in its physical science programs.   UCI has also been called Under Construction Indefinitely among other things. The campus has also received added attention stemming from its http://www.housing.uci.edu/me/hall_desc.asp Middle Earth residence halls, which are named after locations and characters from Baggins End Tolkiens Mythology.

In 1965 the students of UCI chose the wiki:irvine:anteater as its official mascot in a campuswide ellection. The anteater is based on the peter the anteater character from Johny Harts B.C. comic strip, and was strongly promoted by the mens water polo team. The runner up in the mascot selection ballot was none of the above. The anteater is a source of pride among UCI students and alumni who value its unique mascot. The Anteaters 2007 run through the college world series inspired the associated press to run the byline That team with a funny nickname is serious about winning a national championship.

With respect to its student body, UCI is probably one of the more strongly Republican campuses in the system. For example, near the beginning of the war in Iraq, a survey found that about 60% of UCI students favored a military operation there. This is likely because many of its students come from Orange County, which the Orange County Republican party proudly proclaims to be Americas most Republican county.

Image(engineering.jpg, The Engineering section of campus, 200, right, thumbnail)Irvine is considered a quiet school for various reasons, but the most likely explanation is its student population. Like other urbansituated colleges, Irvine has a large commuter population; this leaves only a small number of students on campus afterhours or on weekends.


The campus is also located in a strictly regulated residential community which tends to inhibit Bro Parties social carousing. The campus itself is widely known for its cleanliness, and the placement of its buildings tends to be highly organized, with buildings grouped into academic units, which form a wiki:irvine:Ring Road circle around the campus wiki:irvine:Aldrich Park central park.
