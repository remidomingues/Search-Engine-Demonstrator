UDavis Life was a social community website launched in early August 2005, claiming to be the only one made for students, by students.  The site offered one gigabyte email accounts through U Life Network as well as a few random polls, discounts and freebies freebies, games, cartoons, etc. The initial launch was announced by way of spamming practically every UC Davis Email UC Davis email account on Monday August 1, 2005 which engendered significant grumbling throughout the campus community.  They again spammed the UC Davis Email UC Davis email namespace on September 2728, 2005.  More recently the site and its parent ULife Network closed up shop.

They were initially called UCDavisLife.com but had to change their logo (which included the Aggie Logo) and name due to wellfounded allegations of copyright infringement from the UC System UC within days of their initial launch.  They registered UDavisLife.com on August 3, 2005.  The domain UCDavisLife.com still forwarded to UDavisLife.com as of September 28, 2005. As of August 2011, UCDavisLife.com directs visitors to a real estate agents website.  UDavisLife.com ran wiki:WikiPedia:XOOPS XOOPS, a free community template system.
