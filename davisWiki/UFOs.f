Unidentified flying objects have been sighted in and around Davis.  For obvious reasons, most residents are convinced that the sightings are not Moller International M400 Skycars.  Extraterrestrial beings seem to be more likely, but we all have our fingers crossed for the skycars.

There have been dozens of documented UFO sightings in Davis since the early 1990s.

You can also spot a Arroyo Park UFO UFO sculpture at Arroyo Park.

20050226 23:38:53 nbsp The three lights sightings are very common in the SacDavis area, becasue of one reason airplanes usually have three bright lights. I have seen this before thinking it was UFOs but after staring at the object it became clear that it was an airplane. There are also a lot of military cargo planes flying around the valley, and the lights emanating up from the city wil reflect off the bottom of them. Also during the FallSpring the lights of the cities will reflect off of small low clouds. Users/JamesSchwab

  Located between Travis AFB and McClellan (which, in addition to occasional use as a military strip post9/11, is home to a museum and has many many experimental, historical, kit and airshow planes land there), this area sees just about every kind of aircraft fly overhead.  Some are really quite odd.  Were also in line for Aurora (the plane) and classified aircraft high altitude flyovers coming in from a polar orientation (aka postArea 51 relocation flights).  Plus the past couple years have had amazing levels of sunspot activity that has seen aurora (the atmospheric phenomina) occur in the area to the point that the traffic pilots have occasionally freaked out about it (one memorable time was when ClearChannels Commander Bill swore he saw a massive meteor streak across the sky and reported it to the news services).

20060307 11:36:59 nbsp I also have seen a ufo. While out fishing at the south fork of Putah Creek. Myself and a pal were spotted with a blue spot light and watched a triangle with a light at each corner as it flew noiselessly away.  Doubtful if it was ET, but most likely some test craft of some sort. Thanks JabberWokky for the more specific info relating to military flight paths etc. Users/NeilSaweliew

20081210 01:17:09 nbsp heyyy trying to figure out what the bright blinking red/white lights outside were today. There were about 15. and some were super bright, staying still for long periods of time then hovering and then moving semifast in the sky. Are they satellites?  Users/hoopster7a
   Satellites are very fine (small) dots of light that move in a very steady direction and speed.  Blinking red or white lights are generally aircraft, either airplanes or helicopters.  Airplanes can appear to hover when they change altitude or otherwise head toward or away from you, and then turn, appearing to suddenly start moving. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
