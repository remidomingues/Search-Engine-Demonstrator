20091003 15:55:15 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy Ms. or Mr. Grad, and Welcome to the Wiki!   You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you.  Or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here.  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for adding to the Fifth Avenue Place entry, but that bit of info about the management changing so often is probably worth adding to the main body of the entry itself.  You can hit edit and change the entry... in fact, thats how everything on the wiki was written: people just like you adding what they know about Davis.  The entry itself is pretty bare, and you probably know much more about the apartment complex than most, so youre the ideal person to add to the entry.  Once again, welcome to the wiki! wiki:gnome:Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
