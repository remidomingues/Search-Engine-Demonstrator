It began at 7pm, ending around 1am.

The event was held as a sortof farewell to the historical cannery, which will be demolished in the near future. In the words of Geiger, UNCANNY played with the visitors sense of perception and explored various aspects of how we experience art.

Howd they get permission to put this on here?

The above sentence has too many pronouns for me to understand its meaning. Do you mean how did the students get permission for putting the event on at the Cannery? If so, Im not sure of the details, but I know the fire marshall inspected the place prior to the beginning of the event to make sure the exhibits involving fire and electricity, among other potential hazards, were up to standard/code. A security company team was enlisted for safety measures, along with the UCD yellow jacketwearing event staff. Thats all I know, I think...but I can easily find out more soon.  Users/EliseKane

    Ive just heard of people getting chased off the grounds before and cops being called, which is why I asked.  But, yeah, details would be awesome because I think this was a great idea.

And by this was a great idea do you mean the event or this wiki page? Pronouns, sir! Its a sea of pronouns! Ahhhh! Users/EliseKane
     Both!
