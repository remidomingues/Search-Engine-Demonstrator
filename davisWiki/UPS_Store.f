Comments prior to the current management were moved to UPS Store (Downtown)/BeforeMar1407

20070319 14:15:47 nbsp Hi, Im the new Manager of the Downtown UPS Store. All UPS Stores are individually owned, so we only own this store in Downtown Davis across from Bakers Square, not the Marketplace location.    We are fast and friendly and we will help with everything!   We now offer quotes over the phone and pick up as well.  I am the only employee here so I will help you.  We are not here to rip anyone off or give anyone a hard time.  We guarantee the best shipping service in Davis.  There are no line and no wait.  I apolgize for the all of the people whove had bad experiences in the past at certain UPS Stores, but I have taken over and all employees are no longer here at our Downtown Location.  I have been in shipping for 5 years.  So if you have a question, can you package this just call and I will help with no attitude or anything.  Just here to help.   Users/KipMeade

20070319 20:20:56 nbsp I rent a PMB (private mailbox) at the UPS Store and they forward my mail to me as I travel around.  The Post Office will only forward to one address, not multiple different addresses.  The people Ive dealt with at UPS have been very helpful and accurate in getting my mail forwarded to me while I travel.   I can call the UPS store on the phone and theyll tell me how many letters I have and who theyre from.   The Post Office wont do that.   The Downtown UPS store charges less than half what other UPS stores in Sacramento and West Sac charge for a PMB.   So I am satisfied.  (I havent tried using the UPS store for package shipping yet.) Users/SteveGreen

20070604 22:23:36 nbsp Kip was very helpful when I went to the store a few weeks ago. Friendly guy and he did all the organizing and copying for me when I came in with a mess of papers that were late for my abroad program and needed to be notarized and shipped overnight. Wasnt any more expensive than the post office for sending it either.  Users/12volts

20071104 17:11:27 nbsp Kip and the other employee here are fantastic! We drive from North/West Davis to use this UPS store as opposed to the one in the market place. They are kind and very hard workers. LOVE THEM! Use them! :) Users/Idunitt

20071222 08:55:37 nbsp The people working at this store are always courteous, fast, and professional. My husband and I had a very bad experience with the UPS store in the Marketplace (see comments by VincentFox). We are very happy with the folks of the UPS store downtown, this is where we go for courier shipping otherwise we would have to drive outside Davis. Users/valerials

20080414 19:01:37 nbsp Ive been to this location about 3 times mostly just to drop off a package, so I had no idea how truly helpful Kip was until I needed to have him ship something.  I brought in an oversized box being about 40x24x24.  After quoting me UPS, DHL, and USPS each at around 90108 for my package, he asked me how large my contents were and if I had any space to cut around the box.  I told him I did and he went about cutting it down to probably about 37x19x19 with a box cutter.  He was able to bring that price down for me to about $60. Users/at86

20080414 21:04:21 nbsp Kip is super kool. Users/at86


20090313 16:48:22 nbsp I had to pack, ship, and ensure a large, fragile, and expensive item crosscountry. To give you an idea, after discounts, my bill was $250. Kip did a fabulous job explaining the choices and guarantees to me, disassembled the item to make it more shippingfriendly, packed it well, and insured the packing fee as well as the shipping fee. He invited me to come back before closing to inspect the packing job before the item went out. The recepient was very happy at how well it was packed and how it arrived. I would recommend this place to anyone, and Kip is a truly standup guy that gets the job done right and EARNS your hardearned money. Please dont go to the other UPS store, too many horror stories. This place takes care of you right, and you know you get your moneys worth.  Users/xen0cide

20090722 20:01:14 nbsp Has the UPS Store on B Street really closed?   Its tagged a Departed Business on DavisWiki but its still listed and open on the UPS Stores website.   If I was in Davis now Id walk past and look. Users/SteveGreen
  Ghandi.  I saw the sign on the door.
This store is actually open for business.  Under new ownership
20090725 21:22:07 nbsp Its really closed then.  B Streets been deleted from the UPS Store website.   The UPS Store on Covell is still open. Users/SteveGreen
This store is actually open for business.  Under new ownership.
20090824 12:53:44 nbsp The irony that this one closed rather than the one filled with negative reviews. Users/hankim
This store is actually open for business.  Under new ownership
20090904 16:59:18 nbsp Hey guys,

I just called the UPS Store and it seems they were just doing some reshuffling with ownership. I think Kip is still there too! Users/avinashkunnath

20091116 16:19:19 nbsp I WAS IN THE STORE YESTERDAY FOR LIVE SCAN FINGERPRINTING , THE SERVICE WAS EXCELLENT , NOW DO THEY DO IT ALL  UNDER ONE ROOF . THEY HAVE REALLY GOOD DISCOUNTED PROGRAM FOR UCD STUDENTS & EMPLOYEES . THEY ALSO OFFER BOOK BUY BACK . THERE IS NO WAITING, THEY ALSO HAVE AAA DISCOUNT ON SERVICES AND A NOTARY IN ALL DAY. AMAZING, SHOULD GO THERE  Users/pauljacobs

20091209 07:09:23 nbsp I thought the service here was exceptional when I brought them 4 small nesting tables I needed to have packed/shipped back to a furniture company in October. I helped pack the box myself and watched it get sealed up. Two months later, however, the furniture company tells me there was only one table  not four  in the box they received. Theyve turned their returns department upside down; the other 3 did not make it to them. Theres no UPS damage report indicating anything happened to the box in transit, so Im left to wonder whether my box was unpacked and repacked after I left, and whether an employee of this store decided to keep three pieces of my shipment for himself. He was the only one working in the store that day, and he did tell me he thought the tables were nicelooking. I dont want to believe that thats true, but at this point have no reason to believe otherwise. In the future, Ill call UPS for direct pickup from my home  Im out a lot of money from this incident. Users/calvin2

20100128 16:34:59 nbsp I went here yesterday just to drop off a prelabeled package after a long day working in the lab and the guy was AWESOME! I called before I went over, and not only did he stay open a few extra minutes for me but he also taped up my box at no charge. I really appreciated the friendly service and am glad to have a UPS option near campus. Thanks! Ill be back. Users/Ratatat

20100310 11:12:11 nbsp The store closes at 6pm  not 6:30pm on MF.  I found that out the hard way yesterday.   Users/AaronPM

20100701 09:46:02 nbsp One of the few places in Davis to find a notary public (Marketplace UPS is closed, Aggie only has a notary on Fri and Sat, Kinkos doesnt do notarizing anymore).  Correy is very helpful. Users/amclarke

20100802 17:04:13 nbsp These guys rock! I brought a giant bag full of Comic Con 2010 swag to ship to my mother and stepdad (theyre total geeks) and they had it packed into a (comparably) tiny box and taped up in no time. There were some art prints in there as well that they paid extra attention to protecting, they even grabbed some cardboard pieces to make a little artholder! According to them, Kip is no longer around, but these two guys rocked it. Not only that, they saved me a bunch of money on shipping by checking what it would have cost me to go to the post office. To get it there in the same amount of time, Id have paid probably $50 more. Glad I decided to try them out! Users/Kirrei

20100814 13:47:24 nbsp This place is great. The guy who usually works there is very nice and helpful! Users/Ratatat

20100904 19:34:14 nbsp The service was amazing!! I went in on a Saturday when it was 100• outside. The young man working came out to my car when he saw that I was trying to take 2 babies out of their car seats to go inside the store. He took the package from my trunk and processed it so I could leave my little ones in the air conditioning. What great customer service and thoughtfulness!! I will now be a life long customer. Thank you!! Users/Nicolel

20100928 10:29:43 nbsp This store is impressive in the amount of quality and services provided, Ive met Corey and I was pleased with his service here so Im posting this comment as a sign of appreciation. Thanks. Users/JasonHu

20101215 13:50:25 nbsp went the first time today to return a chegg book and the guy was so nice. he told me to remember to save the tracking number because the URL in my email will expire and i wont be able to get the # anymore. what a nice person ) Users/SallyVo

20110110 12:19:15 nbsp i cant recommend this place more highly  the manager saved me a ton of cash on an international shipment (another shipping provider quoted $130, this UPS store got it shipped for $70!!), needless to say, ive been using UPS store on B st for all my shipments ever since (id be crazy not to), the manager hustles to get you the most cost efficient deal, which is much appreciated in this tough economy. parking in front of the store also helps (versus having to look for street parking in downtown davis, which can be timeconsuming, esp when UCD is in session). the store also opens @ 8:30 am weekdays, a half hour earlier than other providers, lets me get a jump start on my day. bravo to this UPS store and its manager, thx again for the great service and keep up the great work!!  Users/YasminVera

20110115 14:43:58 nbsp Corey is amazing. Ive been coming to this store for the past few months to receive my mail and packages and I cant be happier. Users/NavLee

20110422 17:58:28 nbsp Corey is a great guy, nice and friendly, and they have great service here. I Highly recommends this UPS store.  Users/PeterWang

20110930 07:38:56 nbsp Does anybody know if this UPS store does USAA deposits? Users/ChristyMarsden
 The Davis UPS Store does not accept deposits for USAA. Users/MaxLucas

20111007 16:36:38 nbsp The manager incorrectly weighed my package, which lead to it getting stuck in West Sac for days.  I had to retrieve the package and scramble to find an expedited air service.  Lots of wasted time and money for a package that didnt end up arriving in time.  After all of this, the manager refused to take responsibility and would not give me a refund on my original shipping charges  for a shipment that went nowhere!  I will never use the Davis UPS store again. Users/AndrewGray

20120215 22:04:54 nbsp Really excellent, personable service. The guy at the counter dealt with my occasionally brainless questions with a smile and a quip, and (a strange thing to say in a postal store but!) there was never a moment where I felt unwelcome. He was super nice and helpful and had Sharpies on hand to make a package more colourful. You made my day, dude.  Users/JaniceW

20120319 08:19:40 nbsp The main guy who works here in the mornings is always very nice and extremely helpful! I dont loathe going to the post office anymore, because I just go to UPS! They do USPS services as well here! Users/waveform

20120711 06:11:27 nbsp DO NOT USE THIS PLACE. DO NOT GO NEAR THIS PLACE. ABSOLUTELY ABYSMAL INCOMPETENCE. AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE. Users/MaryCarroll
  A little more information would be useful, especially since your review is so different from the others here. Users/DonShor

20121020 15:28:02 nbsp I cant say enough about how wonderful Corey and Alicia are.  I have recommended this store to everyone.  I frequently forget my key and they will be on the phone and helping customers and just put my mail in my hand without my even asking.  I dont have a car, so Ill call to see if its worth a trip to the store to pick up any mail.  They are always pleasant and helpful!  When I mail out packages, they help me figure out the least expensive way to meet my time deadline, sometimes suggesting ways I would not have even considered.  Its wonderful knowing that any packages I receive are accepted and Im notified when they get there.  Again, these guys run the place like a welloiled machine, but have a lot of fun while doing so.  The fact that I know they will always have smiles on their faces is just a sheer bonus! Users/LadyCooper

20121022 15:01:16 nbsp I needed a notary public to witness, sign and stamp my nonCA outofstate absentee ballot. I called a couple other places here in Davis and they flat out refused to notarize a nonCA absentee ballot. Alicia at the Downtown Davis UPS was very nice, seemed to know her stuff, and most importantly notarized my absentee ballot. If you need this service just go straight to the Downtown Davis UPS. I wasted a lot of time on the phone with Pak Mail and an independent notary, plus the Secretary of State Elections Office and the Yolo County Clerk Recorder Elections Office trying to find someone who is eligible to administer oaths just to witness my ballot! Dont make the same mistake, just go to UPS. Users/MinelvaRomeliaNanton

20121029 08:38:17 nbsp Wow,Went to ups store to buy a shipping box $19.  Users/wkelly

20130514 13:10:13 nbsp I sent a package for mothers day four days in advance at the B street store  somehow it got mailed for arrival in TWO WEEKS.
The worker didnt apologize or take any responsibility for the mess up at all.
Dont go there. Ever. Users/rblpbl

20130622 11:28:26 nbsp Like many of the comments here, I wanted to reiterate how incredible Corey is. Mrs. ProfessorHedgehog refuses to ship packages from anywhere else  Corey is just too good and too competent for us to accept anyone else! He also works extremely hard to ensure your shipment costs as little as possible; on one occasion, he went out of his way to inform my wife that there was a AAA discount, and just today, he volunteered to personally cut down a box to a more appropriate size, saving my wife and I further shipping costs. Corey is a great asset to the community; he should be considered a veritable Davis institution! Users/ProfessorHedgehog

20140211 13:30:27 nbsp The employees here are always incredibly friendly. Users/JakeNeustadt
