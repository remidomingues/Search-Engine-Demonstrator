http://www.upte.org/ University Professional and Technical Employees (CWA 9119) is the Labor Unions union of technical and professional employees at the University of California. We are Staff Research Associates, Computer Resource Specialists, Clinical Lab Techs, Editors, Student Affairs Officers, Social Workers, Writers, Museum Scientists and Lab Assistants, among may other titles. There are more than 11,000 UC employees covered by UPTE contracts. UPTE was founded in 1990 by a group of employees who believed that UC workers would benefit by having a union to safeguard and expand our rights in the workplace. There are UPTE locals at all UC campuses, medical centers, and the national labs administered by UC. In 1993, UPTE members voted to affiliate with the http://www.cwaunion.org/ Communications Workers of America (CWA), a 700,000 member union in the http://www.aflcio.org/ AFLCIO, in order to better organize and represent UC workers.

UPTE works to protect and improve the rights of employees. We are willing to stand up to the University of California to ensure that professional and technical employees receive the respect and fairness they deserve. UPTE represents employees who face problems on the job, including unfair layoffs and performance evaluations, disciplinary actions, and much more. UPTE members in the technical, research professional and health care professional units bargain with UC over wages and working conditions.
