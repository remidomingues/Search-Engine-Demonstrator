The U.S. Bicycling Hall of Fame is located on the corner of Third and B as of November 2009. It was formerly located in Somerville, New Jersey, until Davis was chosen as its new home primarily because of the reputation as a bicyclefriendly city. Prior to the relocation to the museums current location was the Teen Center. For information about the new summer program for teens, click on the link provided about http://davisteenscene.org/thevault.shtml The Vault. The Vault was created as a replacement for the Teen Center in 2010. This new hangout spot is at King High School.

The Hall of Fame had its grand opening at its new location on April 24, 2010.

During January 2013, television news used the building as a backdrop to report on the Lance Armstrong doping scandal.

20100309 16:23:12 nbsp Does it ever open? Users/IDoNotExist

20100309 18:37:28 nbsp I have yet to see it open. I also have yet to see it provide any kind of public interest. The only actual outcome I can see since its being placed in the former Teen Center is a rise in adolescent crime (also due to the only other teen centers closing: the ring) Users/WesOne

20100309 20:39:31 nbsp You can see in from the outside.  They have bicycles.  Wish I could get in...I never see those in Davis anywhere!

I did see some people having a wine and cheese thing there amongst the bicycles once.  Since then, it hasnt been inhabited while Ive been walking by. Users/IDoNotExist

20100425 05:50:16 nbsp Wow.. love how they just kind of snuck in a Grand opening... Its almost as if they didnt even want people there.. I saw nothing at all in print or internet posts, heard nothing on the airwaves and saw nothing on the tube about this Grand Opening Event...  What is the point of having a place in town that doesnt seem to actually want any visitors? Users/WesOne

20100425 10:32:23 nbsp There were quite a lot of people there.  Its also been listed on this page for months.  ;)

I was a bit disappointed by it though.  The collection of old bikes that they have in the basement was interesting.  They sort of have an exhibit on the history of the bicycle.  But what they had was really incomplete.  They could have had a lot more on improvements in cycle design since 1970 (especially advances in aerodynamics,materials, wheel design, clip pedals, seats, safety, etc.), but it was almost as if the last 40 years didnt really exist.  There was nothing at all on helmet and clothing changes, which have been very important for comfort, safety, and aerodynamics.  There was a little bit on racing  especially the history of the Madison, and a little bit on early racers such as Major Taylor.  But there was basically very little on the history of cycling as a sport beyond that.  They are a bit space constrained on the top and bottom floors, but the ground floor was almost entirely empty.  They had the display of Greg Lemonds bike and jersey (pictured above).  But most of the rest of the floor was covered with a giant map of an upcoming race, rather than actual bikes, as Id expected.  Id also thought that maybe they would have more of the bikes used by some of their hall of fame inductees (they did have two), and more information on the reasons that their inductees were inducted.  (Their website has much more information on their accomplishments.)  So not too bad, and interesting for about 45 minutes.  But it really seemed incomplete in so many ways.  Hopefully, they can fill in the gaps over time. Users/IDoNotExist
 According to the Davis Enterprise, April 25, 2010:  ...the original plans that called for a separate museum and hall were scrapped when the concept confused potential donors...Blending the two visions remains a work in progress... the opening has begun attracting more volunteers. Theyll be needed to help it follow through on its goal to rotate exhibits regularly. Whats on display now is really “a bare minimum” of the bicycles, trophies, jerseys and more now in storage at UCD...With the planned hiring of an executive director, fundraising should soon begin in earnest.
