The US Constitution requires a census of all people inside the United States to be taken every ten years in order determine a states representation in the US House of Representatives. These days, the census has been expanded in scope to collect other demographic data, like birthday, race, home ownership, and even your phone number (they say they need it to contact you if they have any questions about your response). In prior years, a small number of people were sent a long form census, which asked substantially more detailed questions, including some very personal details that are quite invasive. This long form was abolished after the 2000 census and replaced by the American Community Survey, which asks the same kinds of questions as the old long form, but is sent out continuously rather than every ten years.

Does anyone know what happens if you dont include your birthdate and telephone number?  Will you get a visit because your form is incomplete?  (Surely they cant require that you have a phone number, especially since the homeless are to be counted, too).
  Residences and nonresidence people are two completely different census efforts (although telephone numbers no longer correspond to a fixed address as of the last census, so there are even more questions about that requirement).  Regarding the homeless, they note that in 2000, they did a tally at shelters on a specific night, soup kitchens during the next day and street locations the following night and the numbers are officially counted under Other noninstitutionalized group quarters, a term whose length to vagueness ratio seems about right.  The form notes that people in prison, nursing homes, armed forces and other institutional locations  including college  on April 1 should not be included on the standard form.  I wonder how the dorms are handled... anybody know?

The data collected are used by Congress to analyze the impacts of certain legislation as well as to determine funding for certain programs. Many people are uncomfortable with the questions that are asked. The US Census Bureau insists that the individually identifiable data they collect is confidential for 72 years. They said the same thing back in the 1940s, when http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2010/0324/The2010CensusWillyouranswersstayprivate census data was used to round up JapaneseAmericans to send them to internment camps. More recently, demographic information has been used by Homeland Security to look for terrorists. Seriously. Also, since the dawn of the internet age, http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2007/03/census_breach.html data https://www.census.gov/PressRelease/www/releases/archives/miscellaneous/007497.html breaches have become increasingly common. On the other hand, census information is used to fund programs that assist http://ui23.gamespot.com/2614/animalfarm_2.gif some historically oppressed minorities.

The US Census Bureau has a http://2010.census.gov/2010census/take10map/ website you can use to track Davis participation in the 2010 census. Federal law requires everyone over the age of 18 to participate in the census. The Census Bureau sends people out to homes that do not reply or provide incomplete information. Those who do not participate or knowingly provide false information are subject to fines.

 Davis effort 

Davis is part of the http://www.census.gov/regions/seattle/ Seattle Region of the US Census, which includes Northern California, but not the rest of the state.  The nearest local office appears to be in Sacramento on I Street, 9164316020.  Interestingly, they dont list the exact address of the offices.

The local effort to get Davisites to fill out their census forms is called Davis Counts (get it?!) and is being spearheaded by Janice and Adam Bridge.  Janice is quoted in the Davis Enterprise as saying, We tell people its 10 minutes, 10 questions and youre done.  Davis residents who have questions or need assistance with filling out forms can contact the Bridges at mailto(DavisCounts2010 AT gmail DOT com) or 5307536802.  There will also be census booths at the Farmers Market and the Davis Senior Center.  The goal is to ensure that Davis gets its fair share of the federal aid that is distributed to state and local governments.

Volunteer liaisons will be assisting paid employees to try to get a complete and accurate count of residents, including students, the homeless, and those living in shelters.
