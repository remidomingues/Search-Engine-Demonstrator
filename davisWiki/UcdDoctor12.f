This seems to be a singlepurpose account meant to harass Users/JeffSpeckles.  Users/WilliamLewis

A few things:
1)  People are not always who they say they are on the internet, because of privacy concerns.
2)  Jeff Speckles never worked at the Hotdogger.
3)  I have never worked at the Hotdogger.
4)  Saying a place is NEVER OPEN. EVER. might be considered a lie, or propaganda as you put it, if a place is EVER open.
5)  Ive worked as an aquatic biologist at UCD and at the BML.  I certainly dont know it all when it comes to marine biology, but Id invite you to show me how anything I posted is factually wrong.
6)  Creating an account on a wiki solely to angrily flame someone is, dare I say it, lamer than being an active participant of the wiki.  Its just words on a computer screen.  No need to get in a hissy fit about it.

Nice detective work though, Dr. Columbo!
