Ultimate frisbee is a game that is popular at many college campus campuses. Many can be seen playing it in the quad or a parks park on a nice day.

In recent years, Ultimate Frisbee (aka: Ultimate) has become a competitive sport. UC Davis has two ultimate frisbee club teams: http://daviswiki.org/Pleiades Rogues (women) and the Davis Dogs (men). In addition to the club teams, there is also an Intramural sports IM league during Fall, Spring, and Summer quarters and Physical Education classes.

Ultimate became a sport with the founding of its national governing organization in 1968.

 How to Play 

The game requires two teams and a frisbee. Ultimate is governed my the Spirit of the Game. There are no referees and players are encouraged to rat on themselves and play the game fairly and cleanly.

Rules:

  Each team has seven players on the field at one time (possibly more or less if its a pickup game).
  The Field is a rectangular shape with endzones at each end. A regulation field is 70 yards by 40 yards, with endzones 20 yards deep.
  Each point starts with both teams lining up on the front of their respective endzone lines.
  Play begins with a long throw made by the defense to the offense. This serves as the kickoff. We call it a pull.
  The offense moves the disc up the field by completing passes between teammates. Players may not run with the disc.
  The offensive player with the disc (thrower) has ten seconds to throw the disc. The defender guarding the thrower (marker) counts out the stall count.
  The defense tries to prevent this movement of the disc by forcing a bad pass or intercepting/knocking down a pass. A variety of zone and mantoman defenses can be used. When a pass is not completed (e.g. out of bounds, drop, block, interception), the defense immediately takes possession of the disc and becomes the offense.
  Each time the offense completes a pass into the defenses endzone, the offense scores a point. After a score, there is a pause in the action during which both teams make substitutions and call plays. Offense becomes defense, and play resumes with a pull by the scoring team.
  Games are not timed, they are played to a score (traditionally, 11 or 13). A typical game lasts between one and two hours.
  Ultimate is a noncontact sport. A foul occurs when contact is made, however, incidental contact is often not considered a foul.

More detailed rules on Ultimate can be found at the national governing bodys website: http://www.usaultimate.org/index.html
The Ultimate Players Association became USA Ultimate in 2010.

20101103 16:37:37 nbsp Are there any ultimate leagues or events in Davis for 2030 year olds not affiliated with the University?  Something like a fun, not supercompetitive, place where people meet up at a regular time for informal pickup games? Users/BrianNaiman
 Check out the Ticks group, listed above.  Today (Nov. 3) is their last weekday game for the season due to daylight savings time, but they still meet on Sunday afternoons for pickup.  Turnout varies depending on the weather, but they typically get at least one game going, and sometimes two.  They send out an email reminder weekly.  I know there are some leagues and tournaments in Sacramento, as well.  I believe theres a hat tournament a couple of times a year, as well as semicompetitive (i.e. between good pickup and mediocre club) leagues.  The leagues run along roughly the same timeframe was UCD Intramurals in the spring and fall, and possibly over the summer. Users/TomGarberson
