20090123 22:27:46 nbsp Bought a large umbrella at Longs in the Marketplace.  Lasted several months, but mainly because it wasnt raining.  Lasted only 2 actual rainstorms.  An internal clip broke.

This replaced another large umbrella purchased at the same store (a Rains by Totes), which died after 1 winter (about 10 uses.) Users/IDoNotExist
