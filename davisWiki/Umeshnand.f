20090810 21:41:41 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. It looks like someone removed your comment from the Big O Tires page. They left a note about the page being about the Davis location and not the wiki:Modesto location. There is a wiki for wiki:Modesto and you could create a page for Big O Tires there, or you are welcome to make comments here about things that are relevant to Davis. I wanted to leave this note so that if you saw your comment missing youd have a better idea of what happened. Users/JasonAller
