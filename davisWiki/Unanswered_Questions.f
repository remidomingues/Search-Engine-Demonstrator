20070831 17:00:46 nbsp Ive just really got to know, Steve, why do you deny things youve admitted to, and try to delete them? I mean I know you want your public wiki page reflect well on you, but isnt that lying? Dont you believe that is wrong? How do you reconcile your beliefs and your actions, is what really fascinates me. Users/KarlMogel
   The wiki is a grand experiment for me in researching what people want and need out of a system.  So when false information is presented on the Wiki I let people think about it for a while and then elliminate it.  How do you justify posting something on the Wiki without evidence or witnesses only because a rival faction on the campus says so?  But in any case the chalking erasing, whether it was done or not is not in the scheme of things noteworthy.  One could write an entire book on all my activities, but the Wiki is not a book.  The chalking incident is being given too much space and indeed I am merciful enough to not degrade other peoples profiles with their own ASUCD violations.  I am hopeful the chalking paragraph will be erased and replaced with something more devious and noteworthy in the future.   Users/SteveOstrowski

20070901 16:39:49 nbsp What false information, Steve? You admitted to removing LEAD chalking, your own testimony did you in. Dont insult my and other peoples intelligence, so Ill ask you again, why do you lie? Unless you can answer this question honestly, then you dont believe that lying is wrong, and you dont believe the beliefs that you would like to push on the student body with your 2member slate.
BTW  the world is not against you, so long as you dont set yourself against the world. Users/KarlMogel
   I would have to look back at the record, (too lazy to do so), but I think I admitted to that one room in which only LEAD agent Max would have witnessed the event.  I also believe that I admitted to erasing a LEAD announcement that dominated the entire board and was about the Fall 2006 election which had already passed.  My memory of the event is becomming rather dim due to my lack of caring.  In any case, it matters very little because in reality I gave some janitor a favor.  Keep it up on the public page and I will erase all LEAD messages in all classroms in my zeal to enforce university policy.  I am not going to be looked upon as a villian when LEAD has done ten times worse. Fortunately for them I have to wait for the proper time to discuss such things.  Users/SteveOstrowski

20070901 17:08:18 nbsp Keep it up on the public page and I will erase all LEAD messages in all classroms in my zeal to enforce university policy. Your short triggerfinger for blackmail is impressive. Users/KarlMogel
  You assume I wont do it anyway with or without your cooperation. How about I hand over a video of LEAD chalking in the DC to the university.  Its not blackmail, its retaliation, and its only because I am merciful at the moment that I dont go the next step forward as a prosecutor.   Users/SteveOstrowski
   I pity you and your bitterness. But it was you who sent the blackmail over those court cases, and it is you who just said that if the information remained on your public page you would do some retaliatory action  which is a threat. And then you do it AGAIN! How about I hand over a video of LEAD chalking in the DC to the university. Look up the definition of wiki:wikipedia:Blackmail and get a clue. Not that I care for ASUCD politics, more so since I am no longer in Davis, but I say go right ahead and hand over the video. Few at UCD will see your actions as meritorious, and I doubt that UCD would do anything about it  after all, they have all the evidence they need that LEAD chalks in the DC  there are LEAD chalk ads in the DC.
  At the risk of trollbaiting, I really have to expand my question and reiterate  how do you reconcile your beliefs about how it is ok to lie and blackmail to achieve your goals, with the  beliefs that you wear on your sleeve? Why do you act directly in opposition to the belief systems that you espouse and try to push on the student government at UCD?  KJM
   You will find that in politics on every level of government that deals, negotiations, and even what you would call threats are made everyday in order to acheive the greatest advantage for ones organization.  In other words ASUCD is like a fun and exciting card game in which no one really knows what your cards are, everyone bluffs, and people put large personal stakes on the table.  With Bobby Gray I lost that hand, but I would never in a thousand years wish to be in Bobby Grays place in his life right now.  You will find that if you knew what I knew you would see that I have used a lot of restraint in what I do.  As such the acts I do are rather small to the acts I could do.  Also I am merely using tactics that are only available to me in handling a corrupt system.  As for the supposed lie, I dont remember what has been said in so many numerous occasions that this has come up.  As for whether I have lied before, I will say that its best not to if you can help it.   Users/SteveOstrowski

20070901 19:02:26 nbsp Kinda ignored the direct question. So you lied because you dont consider it important?  Oh I forgot, LEAD is the ultimate evil and all ends justify the means with you.  Users/EdWins

20070901 19:28:57 nbsp You didnt answer my question, Steve. Give it another go, you have plenty of time. I didnt ask just what you thought of lying (and blackmail, lets not forget), but how you reconcile your tendency to do so with the publiclyheld beliefs of yours that they contradict  and contradicting them in the process of trying to push those beliefs on others through the political process, no less!

I might add that I have come across several people in my life whom I have had the misfortune to be on the other side of an issue with them, and at the same time, to have in my possession information about them that could ruin their reputation for good. But I have never thought once, to use that information for shortterm political gain. Some day you have to realize that life is not a card game, and although the political goings and leavings of ASUCD matter little in the grand scheme of things, it shouldnt change the weight of your own principles in life. Moreover, the very fact that youre dealing with a card game as you put it should be all the more reason not to put a large personal stake on the table. When youre out of college, like high school drama, it will matter for nothing. Isnt there something greater in this world or the next than ASUCD? I still dont understand you. Youre either a shrewd politico in fetal form who doesnt believe what he says so long as it will get him what he wants, or a selfparody, a hoax where not even yourself is in on the joke. Users/KarlMogel
   Sigh...sometimes when you want to help others you get into compromising situations. Not everything is perfect, but I am not going to allow LEAD to break all the rules and never get caught and have that happen year after year.  One person, Schwab should not have control over everything.  Not everything I have done in past was the best move but it was a learning experience that greatly assists me today in future plans.  If not for all of this stuff I have done I would not have allies I have today, nor would I have the future plans I hope to commit into action.  But surely when the association is taken over by myself there will be lots of time to correct every mistake, and in fact elliminate such past mistakes from the record.  Users/SteveOstrowski
    Records of bad mistakes are socially expunged by time and good works, not by making veiled and open threats of retaliation against those who you have declared as enemies. Plotting and scheming like David Spade in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCU_(film) PCU wont win the kinds of allies that you need to convince people of the worth of your ideas  it will only attract similar plotters. In fact, such scheming (e.g. your blackmailed court cases) is a subversion of democracy.  You act as if you are powerless to do any else than the kinds of stuff you have been doing lately, but is only when the truth (about yourself, others), democracy, and ethics are artificially set against what you want that you get into compromising situations.
   In addition to the powerlessness expressed, I almost detected a hint of regret. Im still waiting on hearing about how you reconcile your publiclyheld beliefs with your actions, if you do at all.  Users/KarlMogel KJM

20070909 15:33:33 nbsp In response to this page, Users/SteveOstrowski attempted to delete his statements as cataloged here. His statements were made publicly on the Davis Wiki, so hes waived all right to privacy. Steve was Wiki Community Proposal 1: Steven Ostrowski banned from the Davis Wiki on September 10, 2007, so his is unable to answer on the wiki. This page is being kept for historical purposes. Should Steve ever answer them (and make his answers known publicly to me), his answers will be quoted and linked to. Users/KarlMogel
