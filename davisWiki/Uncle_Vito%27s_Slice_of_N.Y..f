Uncle Vitos Slice of N.Y. is a pizza restaurant that serves thin crust New York style pizza. Pizza is available by the slice or by the pie. A whole pizza comes in two sizes. The larger size pie is 20 inches and is cut into 12 slices. The smaller size pie is 14 inches and is cut into 8 slices. There is also a Bars bar area.

Uncle Vitos is a very popular pizza joint in Midtown Sacramento. The place was popular, frequented often for their beer selection, and had a good following and street rep for Midtown (despite being owned by Paesanos and being conjoined with Pronto next door).

It took over the Departed Businesses former location of WokN Roll when it opened in 2008.

Delivery began in late February 2010. Hours of delivery are from 4 PM to 10 PM.

They have changed a lot recently. The slices are a bit cheaper, and their happy hour special is now limited to 5 standard slices, incl. a special.


They used to have dollar slice Mondays and served burgers and other snack foods like smothered fries and beer battered fried mozzarella.   They are no longer doing dollar slice Mondays as of 11172012, and have taken burgers off the menu.

20100114 23:55:56 nbsp The Vitos staff is great.  Unfortunately I dont care for their pizza but they make up for it with a fun atmosphere, good music and drinks.  There is an interesting phenomenon occurring where the Townies/Davisites...or as I and all the rest of us say....LOCALS...congregate at the north end of the bar near the DJ booth while all the frat boys and girls stand on the south side near the big screen.  Next time youre in try a fire truck and a basket of fries! Users/GreezySweezy

20100115 15:15:25 nbsp Cant beat the happy hour special! Gotta get the pizza by the slice tho, if you get a whole pie the bottom soaks in the grease too much.  Users/103

20100125 16:56:21 nbsp If youre from the East this is the only respectable pizza in Davis.  Users/dizzyditz

20100208 14:22:57 nbsp The jukebox is the only good reason to go here on a Friday night Users/jwsmith

20100228 11:31:17 nbsp I do not enjoy their pizza. Their slices are 4 dollars each and have very little taste. People will make the argument that the slices are bigger, which is true, but they are also extremely thin (which I realize is east coast style) and therefore contain the same amount of food as a slice from other pizza places.

Their bar service, however, is pretty good. I like the choices of beers on tap, which, as of last week, included Lost Coasts Tangerine.

 Users/JakeJames

20100228 17:14:45 nbsp Pizza is good, happy hour deal is good, service has been nice (one of the ladies there is really nice).  However, the music is WAY too loud.  I would go here much more often if they did not have the music and TV audio so loud. Users/DagonJones

20100316 01:12:51 nbsp Definitely agree on the loud music.  I stopped by the other day to get a slice of pizza, but the music was so loud outside the building that I decided it just wasnt worth it and got something elsewhere instead.  Id eat here and hear there much more frequently if it werent so loud all the time. Users/IDoNotExist

20100325 16:58:27 nbsp I love NY pizza but not this kind. It reminds me of the cheap pizza that you find in one of those Manhatten convinience stores/pizza joints. Only when you go to Uncle Vitos you pay $35.00 for a large pie and an order of wings.
Oh and when I got a flyer in the mail, advertising delivery. I called and asked for a delivery order and was told. we dont deliver Then I told the man that I had recieved a flyer and that there was a sign out front advertising that they now deliver and was promptly told. well we dont deliver, must have been someplace else. All this was said with a rude tone.
I would only recomend this pizza for pig farmers to use as slop. Users/JoeRandom

20100412 10:23:36 nbsp The pizza is painfully mediocre at best, just plain bad at worst.  Great location, good restaurant concept, just poor execution. Love the patio when the weather is nice.  Too bad the pizza was lousy.   Users/browneyedblues

20100415 17:03:09 nbsp I am a fan of their buffalo fries, but then Id eat anything with buffalo sauce.  Apparently their jukebox is out of commission.  It ate my money the last time I was there (one of the guys working there was kind enough to refund me my dollar). Users/hokusman

20100427 14:51:33 nbsp THIS PLACE SUX !!!     The atmosphere is terrible, the pizza mediocre & overpriced, the only good thing about this place is the Beer, but on that note : the real reason I hate this place  THE BARTENDERS SUCK !  They are BORING, RUDE, and Keep me waiting way too long, with way too much attitude for a simple Beer, on that note : Woodstocks provides good atmosphere and beer without the bad attitudes & even Beach Hut Deli around the corner, though lacking good ambience, has good staff and beer on tap ;  )
  I agree with SunjeetBaadkar, a Chaat place would be way better here, since both Rajas and Kathmandu Suck (since chef changed over)  trust me , if you think these places are good u really need to get out to Berkeley / SF Users/ReViewer

20100515 10:22:26 nbsp Its all about the buffalo fries! I dont even know if Ill ever try the pizza b/c I will mostly want the buffalo fries! Had some last weekend, and I havent stopped thinking about them since! I wish they were open a little earlier b/c those fries would make great hangover food! Users/lauraAsmith

20100521 12:59:37 nbsp OK, we went again last night despite my previous poor review.  The pizza this time around was MUCH better.  Not legendary, but good.  The slice on special last night was the Greek (feta, red onions, artichoke hearts, olives, etc...) and it was tastey.  My kids got chicken tenders, which were.....well, they were just chicken tenders  kinda hard to really screw that up.  They enjoyed them, and thats a plus.  Additionally, I had a small salad, which I thought was well priced for the size and flavorful.

My guess is that this place is just hit or miss.  Dining alfresco, however, is the only way to go; and for a prime spot to dine, people watch, enjoy the pleasant weather, Vitos is in the mix.  Dont go expecting too much and you wont be too disappointed.  After all....its just a pizza and beer joint. Users/browneyedblues

20100521 19:42:00 nbsp Ive been here twice now, and still havent actually had the pizza.  Looks pretty tasty... but I cant really say much about it, other than that Id like to try it!

First, the beer: the selection is pretty mediocre.  10 or so beers on tap.  One IPA (Inversion) and one Pale Ale (Rubicons Monkey Knife Fight).  Their picks really were not very good (aside from the Inversion).  For instance, they have Sudwerks Hefeweizen... which might well be Sudwerks worst beer, and certainly the worst hefe Ive tasted.  Why not go with a decent Hefe, and a decent Sudwerk beer (e.g. the Marzen)?

They serve their beer WAY too cold.  You lose a lot of flavor when the beer is so cold.  The big, thick, glass mugs are so cold that any head which spills over the side of the glass actually freezes solid.  You also wind up with a layer of floating ice on the top of the beer because the glass freezes the beer inside.  You also wind up with a huge amount of condensation before the glasses warm up at all.  Seriously, guys... were talking beer, not Barqs.

Second, the wings.  I got a large order of the buffalo wings$13.95, I believethinking it would be overkill.  The manager (who was very friendly) said the large order was 2 lbs., or 1620 pieces.  Frankly, they were pretty unimpressive pieces.  There was less meat on the 1620 pieces (I didnt count them, but I would estimate around 1516) than on a dozen wings at Sudwerk or The Grad.  Others in my party ate 3 of the wings, which is about how many I usually share anywhere else.  I left still feeling hungry after the remaining 1317 wings and 2 pints of beer, which isnt a common experience with a large wing order anywhere else.  The sauce was fine.  Probably just Franks and butter, with more butter than Franks.  Not that spicy, but reasonably tasty.  The skin was very crispy, too, which I liked a lot.

On a side note, I worry about how much they serve people on a Friday afternoon.  A middle aged gentleman at the bar struck up a conversation with me and, separately, with another person in my party, while we were up getting drinks at different times.  He was pleasant, but clearly very intoxicated.  He mentioned that he lives in Cordelia and spends X amount per month on gasimplying that hes probably driving home.  It was a bit worrisome. Users/TomGarberson
 I went back last night (August 2011) for the first time in quite a while.  We had some very tasty pizza and the beer glasses were no longer way too cold.  Definitely an improvement!  They had the Aggie Lager on tap, and it was better than I expected.  Actually pretty good. Users/TomGarberson

20100608 20:10:36 nbsp I havent tried the pizza but was there drinking last week. Just have to say, this place has the WORST well vodka I have ever had. Pretty sure it actually came from a plastic bottle. Also, everyone in my party agreed that their screwdrivers just taste like straight orange juice. Not at all impressed. The only redeeming factor was under the bar there are little hooks for purses, which I thought was clever, but not quite enough that Ill plan on drinking here again.  Users/omgstarkitty

20100622 13:33:29 nbsp Used to go to Uncle Vitos for their awesome service and great pizza. Unfortunately a recent change to the pizza crust has made a turn for the worst. Before, the crust was thin, light and crunchy. Now its thick, heavy and doughy. Looks like Im only going there for the awesome service now.  Users/103

20100705 19:15:15 nbsp When Vitos first opened, they had good food, good service and a great atmosphere. But the last 3 times Ive been there it has gotten worse and worse. The managers are unbelievably rude. Youd think theyd want people to come back, but the attitudes (especially the woman manager, whoever she is) are ridiculous. The food has gone downhill, and to top it off, they have a dress code involving no hats? WTF are they thinking? enough is enough, I will never go back to this dive bar again and It is now my mission to make sure none of my friends give them any business either. Overpriced, low quality food and crappy well drinks!!!! Id recommend somewhere with better pizza and nicer employees, like Woodstocks (even though they dont have a full bar, but you can run across to G. Street for that). Davis would be better off if they closed down, end point! Users/davisdego

20100811 11:26:23 nbsp Vitos has a cool atmosphere and environment, and the bar is cool. However, in terms of their food its on the more expensive side, and their pizza just isnt really all that good. Its greasy and just basic.  Users/aggie2009

20100824 02:32:57 nbsp When it opened, I used to go to Vitos 2 or 3 times a week, for their afternoon student discount. I was quite a Vitos fan. I would swear by it and did not go to any other pizza place once it opened. I would love ordering their Calamari and one or two slices of cheese pizza (and a soda to go with it). Almost all the staff there knew me by name becuase I came in that much. However, near the end of 2009 they got rid of their great calamari. Around Febuary or March of this year, they changed their pizza slice recipe or somthing becuase it no longer tasted like cheese (or whatever it was before), now it tastes like bad tomato soup (overwhelming all the taste). I went there in March during march madness and was very disapointed. I havent been back since, though I am tempted to try it again soon. Perhaps they are too focused on their bar atmosphere? Users/BryceH

20101117 16:56:02 nbsp Pizza here is pretty good, I went there thinking that I was going to get a slice off a pizza that had been sitting there a while, but it was super fresh and delicious. I also ordered the potato skins, and they were delicious as well, and came with this really good specialty ranch sauce, I dont know what it was but it was good! My friend ordered the buffalo wings, and while the sauce was good, there were only about 67 wings that didnt have very much meat on them (skinny chickens lol), and they cost about $8. For the price the werent worth it, and I wouldnt purchase them again unless they cost more like $5, but besides that I would definitely go there again. Users/jwieland1989

20101117 16:59:20 nbsp Oh ya about the beer, how can beer ever be too cold? I thought it was delicious in their big, thick, frosty mugs :). Users/jwieland1989
 Good beer should never be too cold.  Too cold  less flavor.  If youre drinking socalled domestics (i.e. flavorless stuff), sure, you dont lose anything by drinking it too cold.  But if you actually like beer, youre far better off drinking it around 4560 degrees (depending on the type). Users/TomGarberson
Oh well I like mine super cold and frosty, so maybe its just me!

20110123 15:36:42 nbsp To be perfectly honest, I dont think Ill be coming back here ever again after the way I was treated last night.  The bouncer was absolutely convinced that my drivers license was fake and made me sign a piece of paper to compare signatures, which I willingly complied with.  Then he flat out told me that I didnt look like my picture and my signature was too different, and he was going to confiscate my ID to give to the Davis PD. I completely understand his legal obligation to do so, but the manner in which he conducted himself was completely unprofessional and out of line.  He was literally yelling in my face This is not you and made me feel incredibly insulted.  The other bouncer behaved much more professionally, and once my ID was given to him, he called the police and got everything sorted out and verified.  I hope that Uncle Vitos fires the bouncer and invests in a UV light to check IDs instead of making their customers feel like felons, but even if that happens, Im done with this place.  He cost them future business from me as well as the seven people I was with, not a good business practice. Users/EAHaughin

20110424 17:21:11 nbsp I love coming by for the happy hour $5 slice and draft Eel River IPA (amazing). I have lived in Italy, where you get an amazing large pizza for 810$ without weird combinations of garlic, white sauce and chili, and a crust like you can only get at village bakery and Uncle Vitos in Davis. Ive found uncle Vitos happy hour to be an amazing deal to get a decent pizza (I used to order with olives or artichokes) with a drink. The draft beer alone of such quality would be around 10$ where I come from. Ill have to go try their new burgers. In the afternoon it is very calm in there.  Users/MichaelNielsen

20110502 21:00:51 nbsp Their pizza is great. But I go there because of their staff. I am willing to pay more for great service. Vitos people are always nice and laugh at my jokes even when they arent very funny. Its a truly nice thing to do.  Users/Dozer

20110524 14:02:08 nbsp It is the only place my Italian fiancee does not laugh her ass off at pizza. We went for the 1$ slice Monday challenge and consumed 4 and 3 slices, respectively, which made it cheaper to use that promotion than the all you can eat for $7 each :)
 Users/MichaelNielsen

20110524 17:42:55 nbsp The first time we went the food was really good but the next time the pizza was very salty.  The atmosphere is pretty interesting though. Users/LoriOrf

20110723 14:36:15 nbsp Tried this place last night. LOVE LOVE LOVE the fries. We got a basket of buffalo fries and a basket of thai fries. I still dont know which was my favorite but they were both amazing. I also recommend the White Garlic Chicken pizza minus the chicken. Artichoke hearts, onion, garlic, basil, and fresh tomato. Yum.

The service was fast and friendly. Food came out quick, and our water glasses were always full. Users/MeggoWaffle

20110916 11:49:21 nbsp Vitos is my favorite place to watch a sporting event in Davis. The bar tender (Bobby) is one of the best bartenders in Davis  hes friendly, and quick to serve. He remembers me and other people as well which I value from a bartender. I started coming back to this place because the service, but everyone is generally friendly. I will always go to Vitos on Saturdays and Sundays to watch football. Users/BenedictIV

20111004 10:46:55 nbsp Their $1 Slice Mondays are now only with purchase of a soft drink. Pretty much defeats the purpose if you are looking for a cheap lunch or just want water. I understand they are trying to maximize profits since restaurants make a 500600% profit on soda fountains, but come on. Ill still go once in a while for the fries, but this change is a good way to lose my weekly business. Users/MeggoWaffle

20111022 11:07:58 nbsp Met up with some friends at Vitos last night for pizza and some beer.  I tried the Caribbean pizza for the first time and it was pretty delicioushighly recommended.  We also shared around a couple of orders of fries.  The buffalo fries were very tasty.  The garlic fries, though... well, they tasted good.  But in the bottom of the basket, there was more than 1/4 cup of oil pooled up.  Seriously.  It was at least 1/4 inch deep.  Honestly a bit nauseating.

Theyre back to superfreezing their pint glasses, so you wind up with a thick layer of ice if any beer spills over the edge when theyre pouring it. Users/TomGarberson
Super frozen pint glass sounds awesome, puddle fries not so much. Vitos has been made aware of this Daubert

20111105 12:12:28 nbsp used to go for the dollar slice mondays until they made you buy a drink.. less of a deal now Users/roxygirl55

20111130 11:19:17 nbsp Needed pizzas ready at 11:30am  told by staff that they wouldnt put them in until 11:30am since thats when they open. Village Pizza had no problem having pizzas ready at opening  went with Village  when there are plenty of good choices customer service is king. And yes Ive worked in pizza and yes the ovens were working before we opened and yes wed have pick ups ready as soon as our front door opened.  Users/mcwaid

20120305 17:28:14 nbsp Im not one to write reviews about businesses on the internet, I believe it is better to go into the business and discuss your experience so that it can be made up for.  But the general manager Donald was aggressive and extremely unprofessional.  And I have no way of contacting the owner of the business, so here I am.
I used to frequent this restaurant with my friends, or any family that would come and visit Davis from out of town, but not anymore.  My brother came in from out of town and we decided to grab a piece of pizza for lunch.  When we walk in a younger girl bartender clocked off and left work but tells Donald that I had been in the business last week, and had left the business without paying.  Which was a lie.  He comes up to me and my brother and says aggressively that he will not serve me until my buddy pays for the beer he walked out on last week.  My brother is only 19 and had not been in the restaurant before then.  He didnt bother to ask any questions or be polite in any way,  he just started accusing my 19 year old brother of stealing beer.  Im not sure if he is used to serving 19 year old people alcohol or what is going on there but that is not my issue.
So I politely pay for the allegedly stolen beverages and we eat our pizza.  When I got home i printed my bank statement from earlier that week proving that I had went in last week and payed in full for everything that i purchased.  Donald said Here is what we can do, you can have your 4 dollars back but you will not be welcome here again.  He then threw four, one dollar bills on the bar and walked away without apologizing.
SO I am not allowed in Uncle Vitos any more because they accused their underage customers of stealing with out any evidence, and when shown proof that they made a mistake they could not own up to it.  As a fellow business owner of downtown Davis this restaurant and its employee Donald is a disgrace to Davis and its fine community. Users/jordanmitchell

 funny thing Jordan was the one who didnt pay for his beer so the bartender had to. And one would think him being a business owner in town would at least have the decency to Pay for the stuff he order and stops bitching about it.

20120416 17:18:18 nbsp Only one mention of Thai Fries in the reviews? Just tried them recently, and they were some of the best fries I have ever had.  Users/OliviaHenry

20120416 17:21:44 nbsp Heard theyre going to be closed for Picnic Day....  Sadness... just more for the rest of us to deal with. Users/WesP

20120428 00:17:38 nbsp Ive tried to love Vitos Slice.  But the service, the food, the bouncers and the attitude is absolutely rank, and so I have no choice but to maintain a wide berth around this place.

1. They cut off their happy hour before happy hour is over.  Even if the clock on the wall says that there is still 15 minutes left in the hour, theyll look you straight in the eye and say  Happy hour is closed.  If this is the case, they should take the times off their sign boards and write instead >
Happy Hour from whenever we damn well please til whenever we decide its over (ps. you cant hold us to the hour either, cause we are too cool for time.)

2. They card like the TSA scans for deadly liquids in passengers luggage  that is without logic.  I went there with a friend of mine who is old.  I mean way past middle age old.  The manager was at the door and he ask him for his ID to verify that hes legally allowed to drink. He replies Whats the drinking age? The manager responds 21 My friend asks Do I look younger than 21 The manager says You know what? Forget it, you cant come in. I dont like your questions, and I dont like your attitude. My friend says Fine, be like that, heres my ID and he pulls out his ID. Manager replies Too late  get out of here before I call the cops. What a weak and sniveling power tripping loser he was  even after he got his way.  Bouncers and managers at Vitos need to understand that their job is NOT to harass, intimidate, belittle potential customers, their job is to welcome potential customers while using their well trained skills of age deduction and intuition to check for the potentially underaged and overdrunk.

3. Their pizza sucks.  All the guys in our house were always arguing about which pizza to buy, and since we usually bought about 6 boxes for our parties, we decided to end the arguing and instead we had a pizza challenge to settle, once and for all, which pizza is the best pizza in Davis. Each one of us either went and picked up a pie, or had one delivered.  Heres how we scored the top six pizzas.
1. Cenarios Pizza #1 because of the best value to taste ratio .
2. Village Bakery at the train station best overall pizza flavor.
3. Luigis best newcomer / awesome toppings.
4. TIE Steves Pizza Woodstocks Pizza
and in LAST PLACE
Vitos   The crust is thin and lacks soul, the tomato sauce is bitter and it taste like tomato paste straight from a can, the cheese is rubbery and the toppings undercooked.

Like a previous reviewer said, this pizza is convenience store / gas station pizza from somewhere where they dont do pizza.

Seriously if you want better pizza  everyone/anyone in Davis makes better pizza.

TLDR: Bouncers are power trippers, and the pizza is rancid.  It came dead last in our houses local pizza challenge. Users/ChuckFrank

20120528 16:22:43 nbsp Im from NY. This is not what pizza from NY tastes like. We had slices there when it was completely crowded. We sat in the last available table. Our slices tasted like they were several days old. One would think that if it was so crowded, the pizza would be fresh. My kids who eat anything wouldnt finish the pizza. Its more of a bar than a pizza place. The only positive thing I can say is that the two staff members we interacted with were very nice.  Users/las30

20121119 14:14:16 nbsp I visited over the weekend for a good burger and found out they are no longer doing burgers! I was sad, their pesto burger was REALLY good. Their fries are my goto drunk/sober food. I really only like their pizza when its fresh out of the oven, but its a good price in my opinion. The servers are nice. Its a bit loud but it is sportsbary so its to be expected.  Users/HannahToru

20121121 16:59:52 nbsp I was at Vitos a couple of weeks ago, and was amazed/disgusted at what happened! While sitting at bar, eating my pizza and drinking a beer, the woman next to me faints(I didnt know her)! As I looked over and realized it was not a result of drinking too much, and since I have medical training, I sprung in to action. This womans boyfriend was there and together we were able to assist her to the door after she regained consciousness and was stable (he was taking her to the hospital). As we were walking out of Vitos, she faints again, but this time has a seizure and looses control of her bowels and now Im covered in human feces (no, this is not what bothered me). Long story short, the ambulance comes, takes her away, and Im covered from my waist down in feces. As I go to gather my things, I realize that, amidst the chaos, the server had taken my food and beer away. This was a simple mistake, since they didnt realize it was mine. Well, I quickly explain to the server what happened (still covered in feces) and that Id just like to get some replacement slices to go and get home to clean up. The server then decides to do nothing to make this right! Ok, now Im annoyed. So, I decide to go to the front counter and explain what happened, again. Yet again, I get the runaround for 5 minutes(feces dripping into my shoes at this point). Finally, I found the bouncer that was there for the whole thing, and still, he did nothing. By this point Im pissed. Seriously? Is this the way a business should treat someone immediately after theyve provided emergency medical assistance to one of their patrons? Way to go Vitos, you just lost at least one customer over a couple dollars worth of pizza! Who knows, maybe youll loose more now....?    Users/DanielHernandez

20130301 13:02:03 nbsp I used to go to Vitos every week for slices, but a new manager came in and changed everything. The atmosphere is not nearly what is used to be and many of the other regulars i got to know stopped going. Its not what it used to be and i wont go back :( Users/NobleMason
