 California FullTime Undergrad (201213) 


If you are going to pay this much for an education, then you better know how to Getting the most out of your student fees get the most out of your student fees.  Or you might want to get some scholarships to help defray the costs.

Notes: Though Unitrans has a separate fee of $6, an additional $22.50 of the ASUCD Fee  the vast majority thereof  goes to Unitrans.

Tuition used to be called educational fee, because under the California Master Plan for Higher Education, California residents pay no tuition for university, only fees.  This joke lasted until 2011, when the Ed Fee had exceeded $10,000 annually.  Nonresident tuition was renamed Nonresident Supplemental Tuition, and the UC Regents continued to raise fees to their hearts content.

 Politics 

UC Council on Student Fees is the official student advisory voice on system wide matters regarding the use of Registration Fees and on the provision of Student Services.  Naturally, they arent that powerful and no one really listens to them.  The Regents do seem to listen to Governor Jerry Brown, though, as he has seemingly arranged for fee freezes in 2012 and 2013.
