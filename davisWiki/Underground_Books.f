20061028 00:31:50 I you want to keep it real, Carols Book Store Carols Books (300 Florin Road) is where its really at...  A falling out with the wrong people meant that Carols Books, the longtime locus of local AfricanAmerican poetry and writing, didnt get into that spot on Broadway.  Underground Books and the 40 Acres Center is propped up by former NBA star Kevin Johnson, the founder of the St. Hope organization.  Hes done a lot of good stuff in the area, but excluding Carols Books was not. Users/MattJurach
