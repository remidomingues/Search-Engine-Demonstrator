Section 8 vouchers are accepted at http://cityofdavis.org/housing/affordable/list.cfm a number of Davis housing complexes.  Unfortunately, there tend to be long waitlists for openings at these complexes, and it is not uncommon for the wait for an available apartment to last between six months and a year.

A more expedient option for individuals who rent housing may be to relocate to less expensive areas, especially Woodland, Dixon/Solano County, or in rural Yolo county.
