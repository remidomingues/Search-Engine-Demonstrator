Every once in a while unicycles can be seen out and about in Davis.  There isnt an organized group, but many unicyclists attend the Damento Jugglers Damento Juggling Club.  One can buy unicycles at Kens Bike & Ski.  If I remember correctly they offer Torker 20, 24, and even a giraffe unicycle.  During Picnic Day unicyclists appear with Whymcycles, a group that rides creatively built Bicycles bikes and other moving contraptions.

There are many styles and http://www.unicycling.org/unicycling/skills/skills.html skill levels when it comes to unicycling.  Styles of riding include mountain unicycling (MUniing), Trials, Freestyle, and road unicycling.  Each style requires a different kind of unicycle.

Giving a comprehensive view of the different styles of unicycling, the following video is from a documentary covering the 2012 Unicycling World Championships and Convention :  http://www.youtube.com/watch?vkDPOwMwQHo
