Unidentified was a Music Scene local band comprised of Emily Cotton on vocals, Users/WillJobe Will Jobe on drums, Kevin Deacon on keyboards, and Tobin Jones on guitar.   They broke up in May 2007.  The management of the band was shared by all members but Will does most of the work. Their sound could be described as lofi synthladen garage punk. The band often played shows out of Wills garage and guerrilla shows. They are known for their hodgepodge set ups, bizarre sense of humor and interesting hats.

2 of the band members are solo artists in their own respect, and the band is also host to many side projects, including a folkpunkguerilla rock project called Strangelove Doctrine and a Punk/Classical project called Beethovens Nightmare. They are all signed on Peace Sign Records, operated by drummer Will Jobe.

Unidentified is a bit dead at the moment, due to certain members of the band being too busy, but will resurface once the members lives get less busy. Watch for it.
