20080818 16:22:49 nbsp The people at this bank are very friendly, so its a good local bank to set up a free checking account. However, the interest rate on their savings accounts are really low so I would recommend getting one of those at a nonlocal bank (Citibank is pretty good). Users/MattHh

20090406 15:22:25 nbsp Been using this branch for 3 years and have never had ANY problems with it. I have no idea why it would be called the worst bank in Davis, nor have I ever hear of anyone referring to it as such. Users/ChrisC
