Due to the bicycles bicycles popularity in Davis, several unique bikes and bicyclerelated vehicles are often seen.  This page is here to document these creations, because who doesnt like seeing weird bike stuff?

Types of Bicycles
  ArmPowered Bicycles  An option for people with limited leg mobility, or for folks who just want bigger biceps! You turn the crank pedals with your arms.
  Pennyfarthing (aka: Highwheelers or Bone Shakers)  As the ancestor of modern day safety bicycles, the Pennyfarthing pennyfarthing bicycle features a large front wheel on which the pedals are directly mounted. Obviously, you dont see a whole lot of these rolling about, but Wheelworks parks one outside their shop during business hours. Also, theres a fair amount of Town Art town art in the form of pennyfarthing bicycles.
  Recumbent Bicycles  These are bikes where the person rides with their legs out in front of them, while sitting back in a reclined position. The rider is in front of, not on top of, the rear wheel.
  Rowbikes  A type of arm/legpowered bike.  As the name suggests, a http://www.rowbike.com rowbike is a bicycle that is rowed like a boat. The motion is similar to that of the rowing machines found in the Gyms gym.
  Tandem Bicycles  Like the classic song bicycle built for two. These are bikes for two or more riders inline (not side by side).  Blind people can ride bicycles!
  WhymCycles  This encompasses a wide range of bicycle creations, which can been seen on the WhymCycles page.

Individual Bicycles
  Baby on a Spike Bike
  Users/PxlAted Fishbike
  The Human Powered Housing Project  The bicycle equivalent of a motorhome.
  Nyan Cat Bike

 HumanPowered Vehicles (HPVs) but not Bicycles
  Unicycles  One wheel makes these difficult to balance, since the seat can pitch forward and backward unlike a bicycle which is pitch restricted.
  Tricycles  Though most often associated with children, a few folks in Davis have adultsized tricycles.
  Pedicabs  Tricycles, like the one owned and used by http://facilities.ucdavis.edu/bldg_grnds/ Facilities Management Buildings & Grounds which they bought from http://www.pedicab.com Main Street Pedicabs.
  Quadricycles  Such as the http://www.rhoadescar.com/jumpshow.htm Rhoades Car which is sometimes seen in Davis.
  The Bike Church/Mobile Ministry Unit Bike Church Mobile Ministry Unit  The bicycle equivalent of an ambulance for sick bicycles.


20090919 10:18:02 nbsp Ive carved a Victorian rocking chair from original design, and am carving a carousel horse, plus acquiring old ones.  Can anyone give me a way to contact the person who knows how the Farmers Market at Central Park operates the recumbentpowered bicycle which turns the small carousel?  Id love to build such a mechanism for a small carousel on our small peninsula Farmers Market in Gustavus, Alaska, at the mouth of Glacier Bay.  Thanks so much. kate Users/kateboesser
