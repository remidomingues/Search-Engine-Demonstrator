With a constant influx of new people, personalities and outside influences Davisites are pretty open to the new and unusual. And when it comes to transportation, we get to see some pretty unique vehicles for a town of this size. Not just your typical rice rocket, but vehicles that fall under the category of Art Cars or something along those lines, as well as some cutting edge vehicles that youre not likely to see in your average American city, all manner of bicycles, scooters, and home grown transport devices. Makes sense in a university town with a kickass engineering department! Some have become fixtures in town, while others come and go with the student tide. Either way, spotting one of these usually brightens your day a bit. And if its things like this that just make you wish you had the time and knowledge to build something nearly as cool, check out the http://www.kineticsculpturerace.org/ Arcata to Ferndale Kinetic Sculpture Race Memorial Day weekend. For the Glory!

20070225 18:56:44 nbsp I sometimes come to town for client work in a http://www.citycarshare.org/ City CarShareowned Prius, or in my photovoltaicandwifienabled VW Westfalia. Users/GrahamFreeman

20070501 22:46:58 nbsp I saw a bus on Monday afternoon in front of Bistro 33.  The bus was painted yellow like a school bus, and appeared to be an opentop doubledecker bus.  The top deck was made to look like the bottom of an upside down bus such that the whole thing looked like an upsidedown bus on top of a rightsideup bus. Users/DavidGrundler
The us economy is topsy turvy? The stop sign on the bus was pie chart of spending with defense taking more than half?  Users/StevenDaubert


Ive seen some guys riding around town in an older light blue VW Beetle. Both times they were wearing what appeared to be bowler hats & suits. Anyone know who the heck they are? Users/KokoSorensen

20120217 19:30:47 nbsp My friends dad used to drive around this old sedan that had this big windup thingy on the top. It turned when he drove it, making it look like a big windup toy. Im sure some older Davisites might remember it. He got rid of it around 9798 Users/CecilioPadilla
