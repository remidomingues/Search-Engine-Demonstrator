The Unitarian Universalist Campus Ministry (UUCM) in Davis is a liberal, diverse, and inclusive group of students committed to sharing, exploring, and developing our unique spiritual paths and social justice concerns in community with fellow students. It is affiliated with the Unitarian Universalist Church of Davis and is run by its intern minister.

Campus Ministry ComUUnity Dinner Every Thursday, 6:308:30pm, during the school year, just off campus at The Belfry, 216 A Street A St (between 2nd Street 2nd and 3rd Street 3rd St). If you drive, there is parking downtown, but not on A Street itself. Delicious meals are provided (always a vegetarian option and often vegan too). Just bring yourself  and a friend!

Participants in the group express a broad range of theological viewpoints, ranging from religious naturalism to liberal theism to humanism to agnosticism.  Many members consider themselves Unitarian Universalists, while others simply find the group a great place to talk about their own developing spiritual orientation with other young adults.  We are a community that has dedicated ourselves to affirming the inherent worth and dignity of all people, including those of all gender identities, sexual orientations, races, classes, physical abilities, political beliefs and religious beliefs.  All are welcome!

During the dinners, the group eats together and discusses a topic chosen by the group for the remainder of the evening. Topics for fall quarter 2012 are:
  Sex
  7 Deadly Sins in Us and Society
  7 Virtues
  Introversion vs. Extroversion
  Optimism, Pessimism and Realism
  Overcoming Apathy
  Favorite Song Sharing
  Power Shuffle

In addition to Thursday night dinner conversations, they also engage in outreach to the community through service projects, social justice work, and social events.
