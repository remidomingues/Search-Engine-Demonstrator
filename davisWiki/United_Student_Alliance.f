The United Student Alliance was an alliance of two candidates running for ASUCD Senate in the Fall 2005 ASUCD Election:
  Joe Harney
  Brian McFadden

Neither candidate was elected.  They will continue to fight for their goals, on behalf of all the people that voted for them.

Some people question whether two people can truly make a slate.  But if you can have an Army of One, you can have an Alliance of TwoFootNote(Two is also the approximate size of the Coalition in Iraq).  The United Student Alliance, or USA, stands for truth, justice, and the American Way.

If youre interested in seeing what else it stands for, see the United Student Alliance/Platform Alliance Platform.  They have also provided some /Music musical suggestions to listen to while reading it.

In short, they stand for:
  Fiscal Responsibility  Not spending $33,000 on plasma screens for AGTV (< click to see why), and auditing units to see if they run more efficiently.  Also, we plan to cut the $1000 ASUCD Retreat so Senators getting crunk at Tahoe doesnt happen on your dime.
  ASUCD Open Government  Getting the budget online so you can better participate.
  Improving Lobbying Efforts  We plan to work with UCSA to try to get them to waste less money, and channel more into action that benefits all students, such as cheaper textbooks and protecting financial aid.
  Cheap Textbooks  Continuing the work of Users/KristenBirdsall Senator Birdsall to get textbook ISBN numbers on MyUCDavis.
  Promoting the Arts  There are many free and cheap events on campus, which we hope to help promote to a wider section of students.

Though the Alliance is a new slate, it considers itself the ideological descendent of Friends Urging Campus Kindness.  The Friends have yet to endorse the Alliance, but we hope that our platform will win over Urger supporters everywhere.

We may be The Alliance, but we have no intention of persecuting wiki:WikiPedia:Browncoat browncoats.  Really.  The slate is just like apple pie  pretty sweet.  Make sure to  vote on November 16 or 17 at http://elections.ucdavis.edu/ elections.ucdavis.edu.
