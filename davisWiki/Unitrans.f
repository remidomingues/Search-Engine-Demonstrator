Unitrans is the primary bus system for Davis residents.  Unitrans is operated by the ASUCD Associated Students at UC Davis, and drivers of the buses are all UC Davis undergraduate students.  Many bus drivers are also members of the California Aggie Marching BandUh Cal Aggie Marching Banduh!, earning those drivers the nickname of BanduhTrans.  There are only a few career positions at Unitrans, mainly in Administration (General Manager, Assistant General Managers, Administrative Assistants) and Maintenance (Maintenance Manager and Career Mechanics).

 Is My Bus On Time? 
Unitrans in the Summer of 2009 outfitted many of their buses with wiki:wikipedia:Global Positioning Systems (GPS) that tie into the NextBus service, a 3rd party.  NextBus is a realtime Internet and telecom service that provides, for buses so outfitted, the latest arrival information for serviced stops.  It is free to Unitrans riders and any one with an interest in knowing if a bus will be ontime.  Keep in mind that since this is a new system, it may not be available on all buses.

Arrival estimates can be queried automatically via SMS using your cell phones cell phone and can even be set to automatically page you.  Or you can call an automated line and simply punch in your stop number (5302045529).  The http://www.nextbus.com/predictor/stopSelector.jsp?aunitrans website provides a simple, regularly refreshing information page for a selected stop.  They also have live maps to show you where the buses on a line currently are and what the latest arrival times are for each bus stop.

Visit the http://www.nextbus.com/predictor/stopSelector.jsp?aunitrans NextBus Unitrans website to see if your bus is on time or held up in Traffic Patterns traffic.

Additional Notes

  Unlike other bus systems, Unitrans operates full schedules only during the regular UC Davis academic term (S and T lines follow the DJUSD calendar). Buses operate less often and stop running earlier during finals week, breaks between quarters, and in the summer. Weekend service is limited to only the D, J, Llimited, O, P, Q, and W lines. Most holidays run similar to weekend service.
  Yolobus operates within Davis in addition to Unitrans. The http://yolobus.com/42.html 42A/B route runs longer hours on weekends, and 365 days a year including Sundays and other days when Unitrans runs at reduced schedules or does not operate. 42A (coming from Sac. and W. Sac.) serves south/east Davis (El Cemonte and Cowell), goes to Mace, Alhambra, then Covell to F, to Fifth, to the UCD MU, then Russell to Anderson, back to Covell, Marketplace (Covell/113), then to Woodland and Sacramento airport. 42B goes the opposite way.
  Do not run after buses after they have pulled away from the curb, especially at the terminal.  Drivers are instructed not to stop.  (Before the bus pulls away, however, running and/or yelling are often useful for the tardier riders.)
  If an undergraduate, be sure to hold your ID card so that the driver can easily see the blue UC Davis Emblem on the top of the card, which indicates you have paid your ASUCD fee that includes your bus pass.
  In addition, old registration cards are no longer accepted as of November 1, 2010. New registration cards are required to board the bus.
  Bicycles are not allowed, except on the last run of the day and all day on weekends, space permitting (except Finals and Picnic Day service).
  Lost and found items are brought to our office in 5 South Hall, Please Call (530)7522877 for any questions. Note: All Valuable items (Wallets, cell phones, laptops, etc.) are brought to the UC Davis Police Department on Kleiber Hall Drive

 History 
Unitrans was created in 1968 by ASUCD President Bob Black after the purchase of two London doubledecker buses, and was known as the University Transport System.  In 1972 Unitrans, as it became known, began operating to serve the general public, and a partnership with the City of Davis (including partial funding) began.  The partnership with the city has expanded and continues to this day. Footnote(http://ucdavismagazine.ucdavis.edu/issues/su07/summer_of_love.html)

http://www.californiaaggie.com/news/2008/02/22/CityNews/Unitrans.Honors.Anniversary.With.Ribbon.Cutting.Celebration3228073.shtml article about the 40^th^ Anniversary from the February 22^nd^ The California Aggie California Aggie.

Just in time for Earth Day 2008 Unitrans joined up with http://www.google.com Google to put their routes on http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/SbSV/~3/271585458/googletransitsearlybirdearthday.html Google Maps. This means you can plan trips across town using Google Maps.

 Operations 
Unitrans has a few strange procedures which ensure safe and reliable service. Below are some examples of these procedures.

  Doubledeck buses pull into stops and then angle away from the curb (kicking out) so that when conductors and passengers step off of the bus, they are protected and less likely to be run over.
  The highridership lines (Such as D, G, J, M, and W) commonly have a tripper bus that accompanies the main bus through one line.  This second bus helps split the load and keep the other bus on time.  So if one passes you by, dont worry; the second one will stop!
  All drivers work a required minimum number of hours  usually around 15 per week.  Most drivers, especially route supervisors and driver trainers, work upwards of 20 to 30 each week.

 Structure of Student Positions 
All student positions are filled by undergraduates, from Operations Manager to Conductor (but graduate students can also apply).

Student Managers
Operations Manager  is the highestlevel operations student employee.  Oversees daily operations of the system.  Also leads the Route Supervisors.

Human Resources Manager  is the highestlevel human resources student employee. In charge of the hiring and release of all nonmanager student positions, oversees the shift selection of all drivers, sets up and participates in all interview boards, and plans and prepares staff development activities.

Lead Driver Trainer  is a student responsible for overseeing the training program, supervising all Driver Trainers and arranging training schedules for new drivers during the summer.

Route Training Manager  is a student responsible for overseeing Route Trainers and arranging a route training schedules for newly licensed drivers.

Planning Manager  is a student employee in charge of route planning and changes for the annual Unitrans schedule.

Marketing Manager  is in charge of producing the annual schedule and oversees all outreach, publicity, and service announcements.

Conductor Manager  trains all conductors and performs evaluations.

Business Office Manager  oversees Office Clerks and handles all Business Office operations.

Support Services Manager  keeps the buses tidy and clean. Makes sure we look good out on the road. Handles scheduling of SS Supes and SS Assistants.


Supervisors and Trainers
Supervisors (supes in the vernacular) and Trainers must hold a certain number of safe driving hours, must currently hold a prerequisite position within Unitrans, and must satisfy other requirements.

Route Supervisor  is the voice of Dispatch and the Road Supervisor.  Supes oversee the daily operation of all aspects of bus service in the City of Davis.  If a bus breaks down, they attempt to fix it.  If a bus is late, they arrange a tripper to start the late bus next line on time.  Approximately 20 of the most senior students in Unitrans hold this position.  It requires a minimum of 500 safe driving hours, doubledeck training, and conductor training.

Driver Trainer  is a student trainer for new drivers; teaching them skills necessary to pass their DMV test for their class B license. Driver training is spread over the course of a quarter and involves 15 training phases. Some DTs are also qualified to be DoubleDeck DTs, or OutofTown Charter (OTC) DTs.  While DTs work primarily with newlyhired employees to efficiently train them in the use and operation of all singledeck buses (as double decks require OTC training and 500 hours of driving with no accidents), they also provide postaccident training to employees as necessary.

Route Trainer  is another training position at Unitrans. RTs train new drivers after they obtain their class B license on Unitrans policies and routes. You will often see RTs on board buses being mentors to new drivers as they drive their first shifts in revenue service. Being an RT requires a minimum of 500 driving hours and a safe driving record. Route Trainers can also perform refreshers during the summer to ensure that all currentlyemployed drivers maintain adequate DMVmandated training hours per year,

Support Services Supervisor  Supervisor of all Support Services Assistants.


Entry Level Positions

Drivers receive behindthewheel training upon passing the DMVs written tests for a California Class B Commercial Driver License, with Passenger and Air Brakes endorsements.  Driversintraining drive all of the single decks at some point, from Orion Mark V, VII, to New Flyer.  Every driver is required to know all 18 bus routes like the back of their hand.

Transit Conductor  the student standing on the vintage double decker platform waving the flag.  Conductors are friendly faces that greet you on your ride with our unique London double decker buses, and ensure your safety while on board.

Shop Assistant  is one of the student mechanics who assist the career staff in maintaining the buses.

 Fleet Information 

See the Unitrans Buses Unitrans Buses page for more detailed information. 

Most of the buses (including one DoubleDecker Buses doubledecker) run on compressed natural gas (CNG). The remaining ones have diesel engines.  The switch to a dominantlynaturalgaspowered fleet occurred on April 5^th^, 1996.  Because of the California Air Resources Boards regulations, Unitrans plans to retire all of the older diesel buses by the end of 2007.


The Unitrans fleet currently consists of the following:

 ||<tableborder1>Make and Model || Style || Bus Number ||
 ||Orion Mark V || HighFloor 40ft || 4344, 434749, 41714178 ||
 ||Orion Mark VII || LowFloor 40ft || Buses 40634067 ||
 ||AEC Regent III RT || London RT DoubleDeckers || RT 742, RT 4735, RT 2819, RT 3123  ||
 ||Alexander Dennis || Modern DoubleDecker 40ft || 8185, 8186 ||
 ||New Flyer C40LFR  || LowFloor 40ft || 40794084, 40874005 ||

^  RT 2819 is one of the only known CNGConverted London RT Double Deckers in existence.^
^ RT 3123 is currently in the process of being converted to CNG.^
RT 1235 was in the process of being converted to CNG, but now has been stripped for parts and is currently a frame at the Unitrans Maintenance Garage
RTL 1014 is the only doubledeck to maintain its original preselect shifting transmission and original engine, it has been sent back to Londons Ensign Bus Transport Museum

Unitrans most prominent color is red.  The entirety of the Unitrans fleet follows the red color scheme, which was adopted in April 1995 to coincide with the purchase of the new Orion buses. The current color scheme was intended to match the single deck fleet to the colors of the vintage double deckers. Previously, Unitrans buses were white with red and blue stripes along the sides. The first buses to sport this color scheme were the New Look GMC buses purchased from San Diego. The remainder of the fleet at the time was matched to this color scheme. All buses that once sported this color scheme have been retired from the fleet and sold.

Sources of Unitrans buses:
  The DoubleDecker Buses were purchased at various times from the UK, obtained from London Transport.
  45xx Series New Look GMCs were from San Diego.
  Daimlers (long gone) were from the UK.
  35 and 40 Flxibles were from Sacramento Regional Transit (SacRT).
  Prison bus GMs were from SacRT, as well.
  39xx Series Gilligs were purchased new (1982)
  46xx Series Gilligs are from YoloBus (1985)
  28xx Series Gilligs were purchased from TAPS (1987)
  35xx/43xx Series Orion Mark V buses  Purchased New (1990)

  41xx Series Orion Mark V buses  Purchased New (2006)
  96xx Series Orion Mark V buses  Leased from Sacramento Regional Transit (1996 Model Year)
Some buses go on to lead other lives after their service at Unitrans like the Jazz Bus.

Trivia

The last run of a driver before retiring/graduating has led to some pranks in the past. It started with just parking backwards at the MU upon completion of the drivers final runs and escalated into parking on lawns, backwards on the lawns, in the doorway of Hickey Gym, in the courtyard of the MU (MU Bowling Alley bowling alley folks were unhappy about that...who knew the roof isnt rated for bus loads?), doing donuts on the Russell IM fields...

Users/StevenDaubert says he has seen drivers chock the wheels of other buses as a prank, however it was very amusing when the victim just drove over the chock and continued on her merry way.

Unitrans drivers used to get silly on the radio in the late hours when not many people were listening; and do things like trivia. Its rare now. Yolobus wasnt fond of it either, back in the days when Yolobus and Unitrans shared a frequency.
