The Unitrans Memorial Union Bus Terminal (MU Terminal) is one of the two Unitrans terminals on the UC Davis campus along with the Unitrans Hutchison Bus Terminal.  The terminal is located directly north of the Memorial Union and Freeborn Hall.  The bus terminal houses 8 Unitrans lines with room for up to 5 additional layover buses.  Traffic in the terminal is oneway only counterclockwise.

Although car traffic is allowed into the Memorial Union Terminal to access the Information Booth or turn around, the loading or unloading of passengers or cargo in the terminal is prohibited, and vehicles are sometimes cited or chased out by Transportation and Parking Services TAPS or the UC Davis Police Department UC Davis Police.

The Memorial Union Bus Terminal services the following bus lines:

NOTE: Please Monitor the Bus you are boarding, Unitrans has adopted a First Come, First Serve policy for their Busses at the Memorial Union Terminal. This means the bus you rode earlier may NOT BE IN THE SAME SPOT the next hour

From the MU Terminal, passengers can get practically anywhere in Davis.  The P/Q Bus Line P and Q lines, in particular, are artery routes that circle the perimeter of Davis and service many of the citys major Shopping Centers shopping centers and Apartments apartment complexes.

All of Unitrans DoubleDecker Buses vintage London Transport double deck buses run from the MU Terminal on the  E Bus Line E Line and F Bus Line F Line.  See the http://www.unitrans.com Unitrans website and bus schedule for more information on when double decks are in service.  Note that double decks dont always run when the schedule says they will due to possible unforseen mechanical problems and regular maintainence work.  Double decks are not wheelchair accessible, but all other Unitrans buses are.
 Due to lower ridership, the Modern Double Decker buses have been moved off of the B Bus Line B Line and G Bus Line G Line, and are now servicing the J Bus Line J Line and the V Bus Line V Line at the Unitrans Hutchison Bus Terminal Silo Terminal.

 History 

Before the bus terminal and the North Entry Parking Structure existed, an expanse of grass extended from Hickey Gym west and north. The westward area was utilized for archery practice, as evidenced by this Eastmans Originals Collection http://www.oac.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/tf7c6006mg/ photo from 1957.
