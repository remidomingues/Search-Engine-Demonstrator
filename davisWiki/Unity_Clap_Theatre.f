 OUR MISSION 
Unity Clap Theatre is a performance group whose main purpose is to establish a coalition that will allow students to learn more about multicultural theatre. Our mission is to use the performing arts as a therapeutic tool to express our struggles, grasp our cultural roots and to promote plays that have been written by UC Davis students and minority playwrights.       > Image(unityclapmembers.JPG, Colores De Education, 2011 )<




 OUR BACKGROUND  
This inspiration originated from El Teatro Campesino, a theatre founded by Luis Valdez during the Chicano Movement, in which it produced short skits focused on the conditions that the farm workers were placed into. This movement was an enlightenment period for the Chicano theatre in which it influenced different art forms that consist of messages about injustice.

The Unity Clap
The clap begins slowly, gains momentum, and then becomes more unified. The history of the unity clap dates back to the farm workers movement. It was a way Raza and Philippine farm workers expressed solidarity with each other in the fields. It was also a unifying tool for the United Farm Workers Union. M.E.Ch.A.


 OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOU 
Everyone is encouraged to join this new theatre group and no experience in theatre is required! Even if you donâ€™t wish to perform, this is a great opportunity to make friends and to enhance leadership and communication skills. We want to provide everyone the opportunity to participate in theatre and learn more about the cultures and histories that surround us everyday.
