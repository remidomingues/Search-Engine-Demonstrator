The University Airport, located on the UC Davis Campus, opened in 1946 and was acquired by UC Davis in 1950. It is now under regulation of Transportation And Parking Services TAPS. It is the home of Cal Aggie Flying Farmers and Davis Air Repair. The Cal Aggie Flying Farmers are the primary FBO (Fixed Base Operator) on the airport and they offer rental of lightweight airplanes, and low cost Flying flight instruction. Davis Air Repair and Utility Aircraft Corp. (http://www.utilityaircraft.com/aboutus.html; 5307561202) offers repair and maintenance of aircraft and aircraft sales.

The airport is a general aviation airport and, as such, it works as a place for the UCs research fields and agricultural endeavors as well as a convenient place for UC employee transportation.

Fun Notes

At night, one can walk down Olive Tree Lane (off Russell Boulevard Russell) to a road that is just behind the runway.  You can watch planes land over your head there  its a thrill.



20050608 19:54:00 nbsp Ive gone out to the north end of the runway on a limited number of occasions to watch the planes land and take off. One of the days I went there, it was slow, and I only saw two taking off. The other day I went, there was no air traffic. You can park by the bee center and walk right out onto a closed section of road between a field and the dirt end of the runway field. I actually took my camera out there to take pictures, and nothing happened. If they question me, Ill just show them my business card.... The above photos were taken by me.Users/AndrewLeonard

20050927 19:43:20 nbsp I dont know if they still do this, but a few years back they used to take students in EAE 129 (Stability & Control) up in 4seater Cessnas to let them see what pitch, yaw, and roll were.  Students went in groups of three students went up at a time and whoever sat in front with the pilot usually got to try their hand at flying. Users/TracyPerkins

20060219 22:41:48 nbsp Id be surprised if anyone had objections to someone watching airplanes land or taking pictures.  In fact, if you want a ride, you could probably just walk up to someone preflighting a plane and say, Can I come along?  I fly out there about once a month and Im always happy to have passengers come along for the ride. Users/ChrisMoore

20060222 23:41:03 nbsp Dang! Id love to go up with someone in need of a passenger. Users/TarZxf

20060317 15:51:19 nbsp I fly out there and spend a lot of time messing around in one of the hangars at the south end of the airport.  I think its extremely cool that you guys are interested enough to come out and stand by the runway and watch people land.  Im sure nearly all of the pilots feel this way when they see people taking pics or whatever.  I practically grew up at that airport and it would be a shame to see it gone, so the more people that come out to enjoy it, the better.  The Cal Aggie Flying Farmers offers reasonably cheap demo rides if you want to go flying.   Users/SteveDold

20060831 14:53:31 nbsp So, as of now, I have plans to get my license there in the spring. Expensive? Yes. Always been a dream of mine? Hell yes! Good place to learn. Ive put in about 2030 hours at the controls of a taildragger this summer just because of the nature of my job. I hear the trainers arent as fun, but hey, once Im licensed you can rent/get qualified for much more interesting aircraft! Users/AndrewLeonard

20061125 15:12:16 nbsp The cops (UCD Police) have every right to hassle you at the airport because UCD owns the airport.  Anybody can watch the airplanes without any hassling, or even wander around some and look at the ones parked on the tarmac, though post 9/11 you might get asked what youre doing. Want a ride in a small plane?  Ask any pilot you see, or contact me.Users/RalphFinch

20061127 01:14:08 nbsp at least once a month i ride my bike to the airport with my camera and some food and i just sit on next to the tarmac for hours taking pictures and watching planes takeoff and land. I got to go up a an Alon aircoupe at the Young Eagles day. I hope there is another one of those!  Users/AndersYoung


20081218 09:50:46 nbsp I am looking to fly into Davis this weekend and looking for transporation to get around town. Can one rent a Bike at the airport? Any other recommendations? Will be there for only 3 hours, so want to avoid renting a car for a day if possible. Users/VijayR
  Probably easiest to just call a taxi for a ride into town and then back.  Assuming youre not disabled, you can walk most anywhere downtown in a few minutes.  You might also find a kind soul at the airport who would give you a ride downtown  Users/JimStewart

20081218 12:52:50 nbsp Thanks Jim. That is a cool plane you have! Users/VijayR

20100810 11:24:18 nbsp For the past 3 weeks there has been the same plane buzzing west Davis every morning at 7 am.  Very unpleasant for those of us who like to open our windows at night.  Besides being completely rude, I wonder what are the legalities involved here.  It is an obvious case of noise pollution. Does anyone know who I can call?         Users/JonFenske
  If it was a cropduster, theres probably nothing that can be done.  They work under a different set of rules than private pilots.  All of the cropdusters around here are yellow airplanes with radial engines.  I mention the engine because it has a unique sound and you wont mistake it for a Cessna once you hear the difference.  If you still think its a private pilot, you can call the Sacramento FAA FSDO and they will investigate.  Users/JimStewart

20110701 13:16:25 nbsp I saw a note from Jennifer Cook on my wiki site  I dont check it very often.  Thanks for the note.  No problem at all with noise since last Summer.  I think there was just one very, very rude pilot who enjoyed buzzing neighborhoods and waking people up. I know our neighbors were mad about it too.  What made it hard for us is it also woke up our young children.  Anyway, it was a onetime (couple of weeks) problem, and all is well now.  Thanks!        Users/JonFenske
