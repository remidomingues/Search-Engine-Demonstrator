University Avenue is three blocks long and from 2nd Street to 5th Street. It is located between A Street and B Street. Along the way it is divided at its intersection with 3rd Street by the 3rd & University Poles.  It is possible that University Ave formerly continued south and crossed what is now the Arboretum waterway via a stillstanding Arboretum Bridges bridge (but this should be verified by someone strongly familiar with Davis history).

Parking on University Avenue requires a W Residential Parking Permits parking permit.  Guests need a visitors permit as well.
