 University Covenant Church 
University Covenant Church is one of many Spiritual Organizations churches in Davis, and is a member of the http://www.covchurch.org/ Evangelical Covenant Church, a multiethnic denomination. The Evangelical Covenant Church describes its belief system thusly:

While the Covenant Church does not require adherence to any written creed, we take our theology very seriously, and our history as well.  We are a Reformation church, a part of the Church universal, and an evangelical church.  In that heritage, we share certain central beliefs, which draw us together in faith and fellowship and make possible a freedom among us on more widely ranging issues.  We describe those central beliefs as affirmations.  In short, we affirm: (1) the centrality of the word of God, (2) the necessity of the new birth, (3), a commitment to the whole mission of the church, (4) the Church as a fellowship of believers, (5) a conscious dependence on the Holy Spirit, and (6) the reality of freedom in Christ.  These http://www.covchurch.org/home/whoweare/whatwebelieve affirmations are discussed in more detail on the Covenant Church website.

Pastor Jamie is awesome, he is just getting better every year.

20070719 05:11:25 nbsp We really enjoyed our time at UCC!  Some special people, for sure! Users/RichLindvall

20080413 10:19:31 nbsp When I saw UCC, I thought it was for the Uniform Commerical Code (UCC).  Im such a dork. Users/CurlyGirl26

20090703 21:06:34 nbsp I heard Pastor Jaime at my friends wedding at UCC and he was really good. I think he either spoke once at DCA when our pastor was on vacation or at one of the campus college groups at a fellowship.  Users/BryceH

20101012 16:14:06 nbsp I like this church so much that a lot of times I go to multiple services every Sunday!  ...or maybe thats because Im one of the pastors. Users/mattr@ucov.com

20110106 10:06:01 nbsp  Not a real church. UCC is a business, they are not out to spread the word of God, but to spread open your wallets. So if you dont got the dough, then dont go.  Users/VincentB
 Interesting... Ive attended several times, and apart from the usual passing of the donation plate, and one time a brief discussion of how they were in the red for the year, there hasnt been anything unusual.  What makes you say theyre just in it for the money?  Users/TomGarberson

20110114 10:04:46 nbsp UCC is focused on packing in as many people they can. They then show us a bunch of lights and some videos to show off their budget. Ask for a bunch of money and detail a budget that makes little sense, then shove the plate around. They spend very little time on the Gospel and have even given sermons that skipped through the bible so that it fitted their point. Which is normally that they need more money. UCC is a business, they are more focused on money and being popular than the Gospel. They have a very pushy staff as well.  Users/VincentB

20110202 20:46:26 nbsp Dear VincentB, I would like to respond to a few of the comments and issues youve raised. I attended UCC for more than three years and never have I gotten the expression that UCC is about money. The church, like many other churches, are suffering as a result of the Great Recession. All the church is asking is that its congregation, the people who call themselves members of the church, followers of God, to donate financially if they can. Perhaps, you may want to attend a couple of more sermons before you make that judgement. Also, I recommend listening to their online sermon archives and I hope your view of UCC will change.  Users/mjwong89

20110313 01:33:59 nbsp VincentB, perhaps there is a less negative way to discuss such ideas. Ive attended UCC several times and never have felt that way about them. What particular things have they said before shoving the plate around that made you feel that they were a business? Users/SarahYang

20110327 22:33:20 nbsp  I was a part of UCCs college group Catalyst for a long time. No matter what I did I was never good enough for the group. During my time at Catalyst I saw a lot of things I did not agree with. I did not approve with Matt Robbins promoting to college men how many women there are at Catalyst. I found this to be most inappropriate. Robins gave me a list of things I had to do to change myself. I did all that was asked. In the end I was still never good enough. I was even physically assaulted by another member of Catalyst. The Catalyst member who assaulted me was later on made a leader. I was ordered by Matt to never tell anyone what happened. I realized I would never be worthy of Catalyst so I left. Which then I found out that Matt had told all of my confidential conversations between the two of us with other pastors. At two different churches I was told by their pastors that Matt and I are friends so it would be better for everyone if you didnt come here again. I was then bombarded by other Catalyst members on Facebook. Telling me how horrible I am. Saying that I am A wolf in cheeps clothing a snake in the grass and Cancer to the Christian church. I turned to the bible. I found myself in 2 Peter 2:13

 But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord who bought them—bringing swift destruction on themselves. 2 Many will follow their depraved conduct and will bring the way of truth into disrepute. 3 In their greed these teachers will exploit you with fabricated stories. Their condemnation has long been hanging over them, and their destruction has not been sleeping.

 These people had me convinced that it would be best for the church if I just killed myself. They had me convinced that all I did and all I would ever do is harm the church. One pastor even guaranteed that whatever bible study I go to I will ruin. I asked myself  how could a pastor be wrong?. All I could think about is killing myself. I love going to church and being a Christian. I wouldnt want to do anything to harm it. I had to go a long way to find a community untainted by the Davis circle and get help. After receiving help I had moved on. But then I found out that what had happened to me had happened to another person. A young girl. I dont want it to happen to another. I am writing this not to harm the reputation of UCC or Christianity, but to help any of those who find themselves in the same situation I was in. They might not find the same help I did. So I just want to share what happened to me in hopes that it may help somebody. Here is a Davis wiki article on spiritual abuse with many helpful links:

http://daviswiki.org/Recovering_From_Spiritual_Abuse

 Once again, I am not doing this out of revenge or some sort of petty internet trolling. I am doing this to help. I couldnt stand it if I heard that another person went through what I did and I did nothing. I harbor no ill feelings towards any member of Catalyst or UCC and wish everyone the best. Just hoping this helps somebody.  Users/Dozer

20110406 21:41:36 nbsp Hey Dozer, long time no see! I sure am sorry to read that youre experience at UCC left you disappointed. Some of that stuff sounds pretty weird though... I cant picture any of my buddies at Catalyst sending you malicious Facebook messages like that. :(  And I certainly know that nobody was trying to communicate that youre not good enough for the group—we embrace the fact that were all screwed up! Anyway, hope youre doing well, man. Users/LandonEllis

20110406 21:48:32 nbsp Long time no see because I am not welcome at Catalyst. I too was shocked that the Catalyst members posted things on my facebook like Cancer to the Christian church. Which there is no other way to take it but bad and people telling me to stay out of church does mean I am not good enough in their eyes. But this is NOT about me an Catalyst. I posted this NOT to slander, but to help. Others have felt this way and it is tough to come forward, so I understand. But I would like to encourage those to seek out help and support for spiritual abuse victims. It helped me when I was close to ending it. I hope it can help others. The link again is:

20110406 23:39:44 nbsp Hmm. Yeah, I havent heard of anyone else having an experience like that with Catalyst. Sorry, Dozer. :( Users/LandonEllis

20110418 10:37:37 nbsp Hey Wiki world, this is Matt (the one mentioned up above)

If any of you have questions or concerns about what is written in that post and would like some clarification, please feel free to send me an email at mattr@ucov.com Users/mattr@ucov.com

20110418 12:23:01 nbsp Wow this church is something else. The pastor wont even dispute what happened publically. I dont think I have met Matt, but this speaks to what dozer said about talking about people behind their back. I thought pastors were supposed to keep the confidence of their members. Users/VincentB

20120203 12:25:17 nbsp Love this church and love the community! My husband and I were very hesitant about committing to one church since we were really close with our church back home in Marin. University Covenant Church is a great place to get plugged in and to share Gods love with the community. The staff is awesome! Users/jenb

20120209 12:53:23 nbsp I love UCC! Ive gotten to know many in the UCC community over the years and they are all very authentic and loving. Really cool! UCC is also dedicated to serving Davis and local communities. Cool people. I find Christ there!
 Users/TimothyLewis

20140415 17:12:01 nbsp Michael Corsetto, continues to delete my comments. which goes to show that UCC would rather ignore the issues instead of face them. I realize its a tough pill to swallow, but what happened happened. Users/Dozer
