20140807 14:52:53 nbsp My son attended UCNS for the past two years. It is such a great school! Class ratios are low to allow for individual attention for each child. The program is wellbalanced to provide a wide variety of experiences to support development of the whole child  socially, emotionally, spritually, and intellectually. UCNS has warm, loving teachers and staff who care deeply about what is best for children. My son has grown so much at UCNS  he has gained confidence and learned how to interact well with others. Its been an amazing experience! Cant wait to send our daughter here, too! Users/NicoleFleming

20140808 15:47:05 nbsp I could not recommend the UCNS preschool experience any higher. UCNS provided both of our daughters a warm, caring environment to explore, learn, and grow during our familys four years here.  The small class environment and low teacher to child ratio allowed our girls a lot of personal attention and the opportunity to bond with their teachers and create wonderful friendships with their classmates.  UCNS prepared both of our girls for a great kindergarten year  academically, socially, and emotionally.  Our family still returns to UCNS for fundraisers and community events to see old friends and see how their children have grown. Users/2kids4me

20140808 20:37:10 nbsp UCNS exceeded my high expectations for my children to develop an array of social, emotional and educational tools to have the confidence and skills for a successful transition into elementary school.  I truly believe we could not find a better preschool and feel very fortunate to have had my children experience such a remarkable educational program at UCNS. UCNS prepared our children (and even the parents) extremely well for kindergarten. I wish my children were prek age so they could go back to this wonderful school! Users/LizWada

20140808 21:22:49 nbsp I have been fortunate enough to have all 3 of my boys attend preschool at UCNS, as well as my niece and nephew and have enjoyed watching them grow, build confidence, and set a solid foundation for their academic years ahead. The teachers and staff here are amazing and have created such a familial environment for the children to feel comfortable, learn and grow in that I never had any second thoughts about this being the right preschool and community for my family.

20140819 22:01:23 nbsp We were so grateful someone recommended UCNS to us when we moved to Davis last year. The staff and families not only warmly welcomed our daughter with love and care, but our entire family. The UCNS staff goes above and beyond to give every child an exceptional preschool experience. I cant speak highly enough about the staff, the well balanced program they have created and the amazing experience we have had at UCNS! Users/MichelleSecrest
