20120601 15:48:56 nbsp I asked these folks to come out and give me an estimate for lawn replacement.  Jim Styers came out, took measurements, told me hed get back to me within a few hours. Got back to me a day and a half later and came in at almost twice what he verbally estimated. No thanks. Users/DavisLurker
