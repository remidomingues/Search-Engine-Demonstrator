University Shell  is a Gas Stations gas station  Convenience Stores convenience store and often the first part of Davis that visitors see, as it sits right off Interstate 80 on the corner of Richards Boulevard and Olive Drive on the main route into downtown.

The parking lot exits to the InNOut burger.  During busy hours for InNOut, you may find people from the restaurant parked in the lot, especially along the strip facing the restaurants restaurant.

Because it has multiple access points and sits on the very corner by several on and off ramps to the Interstate, it can be said that it is a contributor to the worst intersection in Davis.  At the very least, it is witness to the transportation crazy driving that essence of Davis occurs.

There is an Allpoint ATMs ATM at this station.  The practice of high pressure salespeople at the pump has been observed to occur here.

University Shell transferred ownership from Kim Thanh Nguy to Rani Pal, LLC on 20070913.  Around 2009 the owners name was being given as Paul (Same guy?  New owner?).

Theres also the Davis Shell, and the unimaginatively named Shell out on Mace Boulevard and Chiles Road.



20090508 19:33:23 nbsp I like the New Owner Paul, the store look much cleaner after the ownership change hands. I think we should give Paul a chance because he is such a nice, polite and know how to make good will. You just tell the clerk, that you want a fresh made coffee, and the clerk will dump the former coffee, and make you a new one even the former coffee is more than half filled.
Their Restroom are always clean, and I had them never saying me NO from using their restoom. I love their service, and I drop newspaper, and their new clerks now even help you with putting oil in the car. I love this place.

20100608 19:25:03 nbsp This just happened a few hours ago.  A highpressure salesman came up and accosted me while I was pumping gas.  He had a booth just outside the store.  He was rather rude to me, since I wouldnt give in to his sales pitch, and couldnt take no for an answer.  Needless to say, I stopped pumping gas and left.  I would be hesitant to return, if this practice continues. Users/alkonost

20110429 21:00:25 nbsp I buy shell only shell gas, but after some truly horrible customer service I may never go back to HERE or the same owners Anderson location.  After pumping more than $60 into my tank I requested some air, as I noticed some of my tires seemed low on pressure.  After the attendant evaluated that I HAD INDEED purchased gas he proceeded to tell me that he would turn it on.  After waiting for a couple minutes I went back inside to find out that they had no button to turn on the Air/Water (which costs $1.00, but is REQUIRED to be provided FREE to any customer).  After calling his manager/owner, Florence, it turns out that they dont have a button installed inside the store.  Whatever.  I then requested that he call Florence and have her approve giving me quarters so that I could use the air. At this point another man is waiting to put water into his overheated Chrysler but cannot get the machine turned on.  After waiting for fifteen minutes for the attendant to get directions to find the button/onscreen command to turn on the water Florence decided that she WOULD NOT approve the attendant to give quarters and so I would have to go somewhere else.

It may seem trivial, but its not. I was not satisfied and I was wronged as a customer. The correct thing to do would have been to turn on the machine for me AT NO CHARGE AS IS REQUIRED BY LAW.

To add insult to injury, because of the delay I was unable to get a replacement headlight that I needed at Kragen (they closed at 8) and I forgot those little black caps to cover the valves as I drove away, fed up with the whole ordeal.

It just goes to show there is no such thing as customer service anymore. Users/moroccan
 Things definately went awry for you.  The other day I requested the attendant to turn on the water. He immediately did so, eventhough he wasnt obligated, because I didnt purchase anything.  The Davis Shell always has air and water at the ready at no charge.  It seems incredible to me that you would wait fifteen minutes or more;  you must have really been bummed about it. The wiki page for Davis Shell currently doesnt name the owner. Users/BruceHansen

20110510 20:28:15 nbsp @BruceHansen  I appreciate the comment. Im just going to have to give them the benefit of the doubt for this one... I think that particular clerk was simply untrained... I actually dont hold anything against him, as he tried as hard as he could.  I am nevertheless outraged at the owner/manager/whoever for not taking care of my needs! In my mind, the only solution for such a simple problem would have been to approve the clerk taking some quarters out and turning the machine onits just that simple! Alas, the incident was reported to <http://www.cdfa.ca.gov/egov/dms/aw/> and I have to leave the rest to the state agencies that be to deal with it.   Users/moroccan
