20051123 16:46:43 nbsp There is no excercise room, and the management changes far too often. JoshStar

20060425 00:03:32 nbsp No Excercise room. Also rude management. MariaRivera

20070426 09:15:08 nbsp These apartments are really lovely and well kept and the complex is a nice, quiet place. I have a one bedroom, and the unit is very roomy, well laid out, and private. There has been zero skimping on the upkeep, and all units have fairly new tile, cabinets, and appiances. Pitfalls? The nieghbors sometimes dont get the assigned parking space concept, however the street parking is abundant and unrestricted. Also, The gardner starts mowing and trimming as early as 6:00 am once a week. But you cant beat the price, especially for what you get. Users/rbroadfoot

20070521 14:10:56 nbsp After making it through an entire school year here, I must say I like the place.

Pros:
  Quick response from maintenance. Especially during emergency calls (my bedroom roof had a leak).
  The place is nice and is well kept.
  Laundry easily accessible.
  The management seems very willing to upgrade/replace appliances instead of trying to fix something that isnt fixable.

Cons:
  Only one parking spot per apartment. Seriously... this is a college town, the twobedroom units are probably being rented to two students, both of whom just might own cars.
  No garbage disposal/dishwasher
  During a hot day, my upstairs unit gets really warm. So much so that if you are like me and have the bigger bedroom in the twobedroom units, it is unbearable without a window/portable A/C unit.
  Wiring for TV/internet not exactly ideal and well done.
  The two bedrooms are backtoback. Certain noises transfer a little too easily. Users/StuartJeff

20080206 09:44:51 nbsp Ive lived here for almost 3 years now and I love the cheap rent. My only complaint is the bike parking. There is almost no spots to lock your bike to the rack. Both me and my roommate have had our bikes stolen here, because we had to lock the wheel to the frame. Users/MattHh

20081115 17:49:11 nbsp to all people thinking of getting an apartment here: you have to pay a deposit in order to get a key to laundry and pool, laundry machines are more expensive than other apartments ive seen, they charge you at least $8 on top of your rent for insurance and you have to pay your own water and sewage bill. no dishwasher or garbage disposal, thin walls and roof so that if you live downstairs you can hear people running around upstairs and even showering. but its warmer than most apartments in winter and not too hot in summer b/c of all the trees. parking spots in parking lot are EXTREMELY narrow and only one per apartment of course, and since its so narrow parking is difficult and most people park crappy anyways. but theres plenty of parking on the street, just make sure to take valuables out of your car, even shoes.
closets are just ok...on the smaller side. very limited kitchen space for plates and such, and bathroom has almost no storage space.

so yeah, this place has fairly roomy apartments and is close to everything, both south and north davis, but the low sticker price is offset by other ways in which they tax you, like with the water and insurance charges that i mentioned above. and yeah, no exercise room. Users/boing3887

20091204 14:22:22 nbsp I lived here for a couple years and really enjoyed it. The location and price cant be beat anywhere in Davis. Donna is an awesome manager and goes out of her way to help you out. Maintenance was always done the same day I reported any problems, and Josh the maintenance guy is always friendly. The apartments are nice, and stay warm in the winter. I have stayed at a few different places in Davis, and this was not only the cheapest, but nicest.  Users/ryanabe

20100125 23:13:17 nbsp Can anyone describe the typical noise level on a given weekday? Users/Mellerz
 If you are senstive to noise this may be an issue, the train is quite noisy from any appartment this close to the tracks. However, the residential noise is quite low in my experience living there from 20052008 Users/MattHh
 I actually live here now and its pretty quiet. :) Users/Mellerz

20110518 10:37:02 nbsp Put down a deposit ($500) here for single under 12month lease at $835/month. Water and heat included. Looking forward to the move as a transfer student. Users/JuanPauloVarela

20120122 18:02:15 nbsp Ive been living her since early September and although I probably will not be renewing my lease, overall I think it is a very nice complex and WOULD recommend it to people looking for a pretty nice, inexpensive place to stay.

The manager, Donna, is one of the sweetest people Ive ever met and is incredibly professional in her interactions with residents. I leased an apartment from them sightunseen (I moved here from the east coast for grad school) and, at first, my dealings with a woman named Linda left me more than a little nervous about what I had actually signed on for. She seemed very disorganized (called me several times to ask the same questions) and was very unsympathetic that my being from the east coast made it difficult to come in and sign the lease paperwork early. She also told me during one of our earliest conversations that they do not rent to undergraduates (which of course is discriminatory, but it was my first time renting an apartment so I didnt know any better)  obviously, this wasnt true either.

BUT, when I did get to Davis and arrived (2 days before movein) so I could sign the lease paperwork, Donna made up for all of my concerns in about 30 seconds. She apologized profusely for Lindas behavior, apparently the woman no longer worked for them. She said she wouldve been more than happy to give me my keys early (I was staying in a hotel) if Linda had actually written down the appointment Id made with her, but as things were the carpets needed to be cleaned and I didnt mind the extra two days that much. I got all of the paperwork signed, she explained everything VERY clearly, and on movein day she came and did a walk through that included checking my keys to make sure all of them worked, even the mailbox/pool keys (Ive since heard stories from other complexes about keys that dont work, and are a huge hassle to get fixed). We did find a bit of a surprise in the kitchen  she opened one of the drawers and a tiny cockroach was in it. Then she got even MORE apologetic and called an exterminator immediately  he came by and sprayed, and I havent seen any hint of bugs in the kitchen since. Recently I went back east for the holidays, and on the way back my purse got stolen  I explained the situation to her, and she replaced my keys right then. Every time I go into the office she always has a smile on her face and something kind to say, and Josh the maintenance man is very ontop of problems, even taking care of other little things that he happens to come across. The rent is cheap (for Davis, anyway), there is now PLENTY of bike parking, and even though theres no gym if youre a university student the campus gym is ten minutes away. I pay 835/month for a one bedroom (next year is 850 I think), electric, heat and water are NOT included, nor is insurance. Parking spaces are a bit narrow, but you can park on the street surrounding the complex and there are almost always spaces there to be had. As for location  I dare you to find a complex this good for the price. I make a right turn out of the complex, ride 7 minutes down 3rd street, and Ive hit campus.

Im shopping around for a new place mostly because of noise  the walls are paperthin here, and I have some partyhardy undergraduates above and beside me. Im a graduate student, and a pretty quiet one at that, so having to listen to the constant thumping of a subwoofer and loud yakking about boyfriend drama is a massive source of stress. It is more than likely that other areas of the complex are quieter, and that I just got bad luck on that account. I also dislike having windows that look into other peoples apartments (Im a big fan of natural light and open spaces), though again that might not be so bad in areas where you dont have neighbors that smoke outside your kitchen and stare into your window. If you can snag a unit with a patio/balcony, or even if you dont mind the noise so much, I think its possible to have a really lovely place to call home in University Square.  Users/SMessbr

20120127 19:14:28 nbsp I lived at University square for two years and loved every minute of it. At the time we were able to get a 2 bedroom 1 bath for about $1,000, which split 3 ways was really affordable. The location, room sizes, small community feel and potential backyards/patios are the best qualities of the complex. The apartments are a minute walk from the bars and rest of downtown, so the location is perfect. The room sizes were shockingly large. You can fit 2 beds and two desks, a dresser, TV and bookshelf in most of the larger rooms, depending on where the door and closet are. The smaller rooms are more than enough space for 1 person but having 2 would definitely be pushing it. Ive seen it done before, though. The small community feel is amazing as well. The place is crammed together and you can always walk down a few units and have a drink with some neighbors. I did so and managed to make some lifelong friends in the process. Where else this close to downtown are you able to have a fully fenced backyard on the 1st floor? Amazing perk.
The cons: The thin walls, especially the ceiling. If your upstairs neighbors are active, you will be annoyed out of your mind at times. You can hear every footstep with each creak. The limited closet space is also problematic. For some reason the larger of the two bedrooms (which is more likely to be shared) has the smaller of the two bedroom closets. Further, the smaller bedroom is also the only bedroom with a built in wall AC unit. During the summer months, it was almost impossible to cool down the larger room.  Users/ScottLondon

20120529 17:35:04 nbsp Can any former or current residents tell me how noisy it is due to the close train tracks?  Users/JChen

20121010 12:54:09 nbsp This is a nice to place to live. I just moved in August. Clean Rooms and the staff is top noch. The whole reason iam writing this review is because of what happened to me just an hour ago. I was at school and lost my keys. No bike lock key no car or house key. So i ended up walking home and i am waiting for there lunch hour to be over. Donna over hears me on the phone all stressed about not having a key. She invites me in during her lunch hour and cuts a brand new key for me right there. I was prepared to call a locksmith and pay a crazy amount to get in. But in the end i only payed ten dollars. It is nice to know that the staff will help you out as much as they can. For this reason and the price and location i would have to recommend living here. Users/JamesMathison

20131223 21:07:00 nbsp Subtenant needed for ground floor one bedroom apartment at University Square  this is a GREAT apartment, but I am leaving UCD and need to find a subtenant beginning winter quarter.
