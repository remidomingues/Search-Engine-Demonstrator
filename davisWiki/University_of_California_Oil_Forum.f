The University of California Oil Forum was founded in 2006 by a group of University of California alumni concerned with the issue of energy depletion. The mission of the University of California Oil Forum is to educate the public and opinion leaders on energy issues.

Speakers

David Osleger on The Nature and Origins of Oil and Gas

Image(osleger.jpg, 80, thumbnail)David Osleger is a LecturerSOE in the Geology Department at UC Davis. He received his Ph.D. from Virginia Polytechnic Institute in 1990 and has been at UC Davis since 1998, following positions at USC, UC Riverside and the University of Texas. Dave worked in the oil industry as a geophysicist for Gulf Oil from 19811985, exploring for oil in the Gulf of Mexico as well as onshore basins. He has maintained his interests in oil exploitation through research on petrophysical heterogeneity of hydrocarbon reservoirs. His other research interests include orbital stratigraphy, sealevel history, sedimentation in lakes, and paleoclimatology. He has worked on a variety of projects throughout the North American Cordillera, including the strontium and carbon isotopic signatures of ancient oceans recorded in rocks of the Canadian Rockies, the global climatic significance of episodes of oceanic anoxia retained in rocks of northeastern Mexico, and the paleoclimate history of the High Sierra as deduced from Lake Tahoe sediment cores.

David Goodstein on The End of the Age of Oil

Image(goodstein.jpg, 80, thumbnail)David Goodstein is Vice Provost and Professor of Physics and Applied Physics at Caltech, where he has been on the faculty for more than 35 years. In 1995, he was named the Frank J. Gilloon Distinguished Teaching and Service Professor. In 1999, he was awarded the Oersted Medal of the American Association of Physics Teachers, and in 2000, the John P. McGovern Medal of the Sigma Xi Society. He has served on and chaired numerous scientific and academic panels, including the National Advisory Committee to the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate of the National Science Foundation. He is a founding member of the Board of Directors of the California Council on Science and Technology. His books include States of Matter (Prentice Hall, 1975, Dover, 1985) and Feynman’s Lost Lecture (Norton, 1996), written with his wife, Dr. Judith Goodstein. In the 1980’s he was Director and host of The Mechanical Universe, an educational television series that has been used by millions of students all over the world. In recent times, while continuing to teach and conduct research in experimental Condensed Matter Physics, Professor Goodstein has turned his attention to issues related to science and society. In articles, speeches and colloquia he has addressed conduct and misconduct in science, the end of exponential growth of the scientific enterprise, and issues related to fossil fuel and the climate of Planet Earth. He is author of one of the essential books on oil depletion analysis, Out of Gas: The End of the Age of Oil. 

Randy Udall on Americas Energy Challenges

Image(udall.jpg, 80, thumbnail)Randy Udall is cofounder of the Association for the Study of Peak OilUSA, which held its first conference in Denver last November. He is Executive Director of the Community Office for Resource Efficiency in Aspen, Colorado, a nonprofit organization that promotes renewable energy, energy efficiency and green building in western Colorado and beyond. He has organized numerous projects that include renewable energy mitigation, governmentbusiness energy partnerships, and a range of energyrelated tax incentive programs. Mr. Udall has written many articles on supply issues concerning such sources as oil, gas, and shale. He is a veteran speaker on conservation issues and oil and gas depletion.

Andrew Frank on A Here and Now SolutionThe PlugIn Hybrid

Image(frank.jpg, 80, thumbnail)Andrew A Frank is Professor of Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineering at UC Davis. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Southern California. His research expertise includes mechanical design, control systems, electric hybrid vehicles, internal combustion engine design, dynamics of machines, automated highways, and ground transportation systems. For three decades Professor Frank has worked to develop the plugin hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), a technology designed to integrate the transportation business into the stationary energy sector and provide consumptionside solutions to the world’s liquid fuel energy problems. Beyond being published in countless academic journals, Professor Frank’s work has been featured recently on CNN, in the April 2006 issue of Scientific American, and in numerous other forums and publications. Dr. Frank is currently working as Chief Technology Officer at wiki:dixon:Efficient_Drivetrains%2C_Inc. Efficient Drivetrains, Inc.
