 Previously Solved Mysteries 





20070404 12:09:20 nbsp I want to say that is near everson hall, I am not sure though, I think I should go and move it. Users/DavidPoole

20070404 12:28:45 nbsp If you do find a twin near Everson Hall, feel free to move it. Users/WesHardaker

20070405 12:18:34 nbsp It looks like the leaves are surrounding the wheel as if they were molded there. This could have been parked in a concrete bike pod for quite some time and then removed. I know campus has been replacing a lot of the concreet bike pods with actual racks. Ive seen them doing this by Wellman and the Art Building, but I know its going on in more places than that. Users/ArlenAbraham

20070405 12:27:46 nbsp Ah, I was wondering what might have caused that particular formation and thats a good guess as to what happened.  Unfortunately, its a bad guess as to where this particular bike is. Users/WesHardaker



For the grey electrical type box mystery:

20090117 20:10:08 nbsp Its an electrical box, possibly a transformer for residential neighborhood.  Or it may contain cable (data/tv) or phone wiring. Users/IDoNotExist

 Users/RyanBasilio

20090122 14:47:55 nbsp What a nice robot leg... Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20090122 18:19:54 nbsp Nope, Nope and Nope but I assure you it is a commonly traveled place. Users/AlexMandel

20090122 18:29:33 nbsp It is an upside down robot leg. Robots walk around right side up under the ground, with their heads in the proper orientation (pointing towards the center of the Earth).  This is unlike us Topsiders, who walk around upside down with our heads pointing out into space.  This particular robot had the misfortune of stepping on a sinkhole, and its leg punched through the surface onto the Topside.  It would be a good idea to return it  before they invade... Users/IDoNotExist
