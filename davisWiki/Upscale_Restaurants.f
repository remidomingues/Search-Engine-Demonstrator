Upscale Restaurants are restaurants that tend to have fewer people wearing backwards hats.  They accomplish this mission not through the use of extensive security forces, but instead high prices. Expect there to be white tablecloths, high quality alcohol, innovative recipes unlikely to be cooked at home, and an emphasis on the presentationFootNote(...not to mention ostentation) of the food. As a general rule, you can get seafood and steak, but Vegetarian Options vegetarian options often emphasize portabella mushrooms and eggplant.  Ambiance is generally good at these spots.

right... places Ill probably never eat...  Users/MarieHuynh

Users/JackHaskel asked whether Symposium is upscale. Although its kinda pricey, I would say no because (1) it has takeout, (2) its very family friendly and (3) its best known for its tasty pizza, which happens to be cheaper than most places in town when you account for Pizza: FSI Calculations FSI . I guess I would call them uppermidscale, the same level i would call Cafe Bernardo, Kathmandu Kitchen, and Fuzio.  Users/CraigBrozinsky

20070218 19:17:14 nbsp I added a fine dining section to the main Davis restaurants page.  As for this page, Little Prague just isnt fine dining in my opinion.  The others are okay. Users/GregKuperberg

20100131 13:15:59 nbsp I agree with the removal of mikunis.  Trendy, yes, overpriced, yes, upscale nooooooo.  They have more of a club/bar atmosphere than an upscale atmosphere IMO. Users/rfrazier

20100131 14:20:36 nbsp I do like Mikunis, but including them on the list opens the door to a lot of other borderline restaurants that are pricey but fall short of fine dining.

Ill also note that Tucos is a fantastic place to drop by for a glass of wine and some cheese with crackers, fruit, and nuts.  They have a nice selection of delicious cheeses, which come with an assortment of tasty tidbits for something like $5.50.  It makes a great date, or just a pleasant, classy, and surprisingly cheap stop before or after catching a movie or shopping downtown. Users/TomGarberson

20100131 14:43:37 nbsp I also agree w/removing Mikunis.  But I do think Little Prague should be on the list, even if many people dont like it because of the proprietor. Users/CovertProfessor
