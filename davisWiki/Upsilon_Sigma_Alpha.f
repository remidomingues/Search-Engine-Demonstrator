Upsilon Sigma Alpha claimed to be a proAmerican, media oriented, coed Davis Honor Societies Honor Society.  It was unofficially established in April of 2007 and became a SPAC organization in May of 2007. They are not a member of any established honor society association, rather they seek to become an interhonor society association. A sister honor society has begun filing paperwork to become official as well. They are also working on starting a chapter at San Diego State University.  Upsilon Sigma Alpha members say that they will never use illegal or controlled substances during their events or functions.

It was part of Steve Ostrowski Steve Ostrowskis empire.

Their motto is: Were a REAL organization.

20071030 00:42:41 nbsp Upsilon Sigma Alpha has pledged to be drug free during all functions and locations.

I never pledged anything. Users/GregWebb

20071030 08:53:47 nbsp Being drug free is part of being American. Users/JoseBleckman
  Starbucks on every corner is American.  Tobacco fields are American.  Beer on Sunday with football is American.  America is a nation of drugs, I cannot pledge to avoid them because I cannot pledge to not be  American.  GW

20071030 12:19:02 nbsp Greg, were not talking about cigarettes or alcohol.  As long as you are over 18 when you buy or possess cigarettes and over 21 when you buy or possess alcohol thats fine.  But it is unAmerican to possess or buy any other sort of illegal drug.  I put down a ban on narcotics until we can establish how we define the word drug.  Users/RonPayne
   Either they are too stupid to understand or they are yanking your chain.  And they arent stupid.  Dont play their game; it is perfectly clear what you meant to say, Ron.  Either that, or they cant understand a NA meeting or one of the old Grateful Dead concert drug free zones, and are going to have difficulty getting through life being that mindlessly kneejerk pedantic with a monophilosophical point of view.  This looks like a fun group, just ignore the razzing.  When I was in college, there was a group similar to this, but they didnt last.  They threw some great parties, though, and they spun off a small tennis league.  Users/JabberWokky

20071030 12:43:58 nbsp I like this group. Users/CarlosOverstreet

20071030 18:25:50 nbsp Ok I like the war on drugs, it allows President Bush to send money to my people. Users/GregWebb

20071031 01:25:45 nbsp To be a truly proAmerican group those average bowling scores need to go up. Users/JimEvans

20071031 01:52:44 nbsp Where are the Average Baseball Scores and Fantasy Football Rankings?

Or, if you cant do fantasy football, how about Fantasy Congress? Users/MaxMikalonis

20071105 23:17:25 nbsp When are you going to pass a bill allowing heterosexuals to join? Users/JamesSchwab

20071105 23:58:25 nbsp It is implied and already in our codes that heterosexuals could join.   Users/RonPayne

20071106 00:08:30 nbsp How is it implied and in what codes? Users/JamesSchwab

20071106 07:36:26 nbsp so if your USA frat bill #1 hadnt passed by one vote, would Upsilon Sigma Alpha be in non compliance with UCD principles of community? close call... Users/PxlAted

20071106 19:18:31 nbsp For as much as you debate candidates here..Id think one of you would have noted the election on the Front Page! Users/PhilipNeustrom
  Heh. Typically, I enter the site via Recent Changes. I tend to forget that there is a Front Page. :) Rest assured, though, that I spent a great deal of time yesterday reminding people about the election. And then explaining to them that it was the real election, not the student goverment one. Such is life in Upsilon Sigma Alpha.The Unknown Sage

Do we need to have a meeting in that part of campus, Ron? Thats awfully late for a friday.The Unknown Sage
  We also will be chilling with Chairman Rivera at that time...sooo I really dont think its gonna work out.  GW
    Ive heard that ASUCD allocates huge estates to the Commission Chairs. Im excited to see the four pools.The Unknown Sage
     Why, whats going on with you guys on Friday?  I already sent a notice to the California Aggie so I cant really back out now.  Maybe we can have another meeting sometime.  Users/RonPayne
     Top secret IAC meeting to light copies of the Pledge Bill on fire and cook vegetarian burgers over it. GW
        However Gregory demanded there be American beef there too.The Unknown Sage, American Patriot
