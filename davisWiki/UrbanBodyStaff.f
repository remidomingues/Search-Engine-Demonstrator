There are two things you should consider:

 1. The file name contains amperstands and spaces and such. For reasons I really dont want to get into, thats a bad thing. On top of that, the name is unnecessarily long. Try a simple name that describes the content of the picture and doesnt use any characters other than numbers, letters, dashes, periods (other than in the file extension) and underscores, like storefront.jpg. The title of the image isnt going to be displayed on the page anyway.
 1. You will get a whole lot more respect on here if you guys edit using your real names rather than a communal account. With a communal account, there is no individual accountability for edits because it isnt always certain who made what changes. Additionally, we want people to be members of our editing community and not just edit a small number of pages, like those pertaining to Urban Body. With this account, youve boxed yourself into just editing pages about this business. Its sad to see people confine their editing experience to a small set of pages.  We strongly discourage communal accounts for these reasons. Users/WilliamLewis

20110321 13:14:33 nbsp Did you read Williams comment? Users/JasonAller

20110321 13:18:33 nbsp I saw your name change request so I took care of it for you, however the & does cause problems so I spelled out the and. Hope it helpsUsers/PeterBoulay

20110321 17:58:35 nbsp Well, I would have waited for you to reply and then explained why Williams point number two is important and how you could rename the page. Instead someone jumped in, read only part of what William wrote, and renamed the page using and instead of & like you asked. I do encourage you to participate in the community as a member of the community rather than with an account that creates an aura of exceptional voice. Users/JasonAller

Been fixed to use the &  Users/PeterBoulay
