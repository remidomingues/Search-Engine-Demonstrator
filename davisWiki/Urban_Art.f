Urban Art (usually in the form of graffiti) means unsanctioned art, as opposed to Town Art officially sanctioned art. Also called street art, it does not mean that one is of higher quality, or even necessitate a different style. Urban art is often created under duress which sanctioned/approved art is not, and this constrains it. It is guerrilla art. Urban art is, however, free of any censorship, commercialism, and community mores which establishment art must hew to. This liberates it and makes it uncompromised; it is pure art.

Unsanctioned street performances such as those of flashmob flashmobs and the Ku Klux Klown could also be considered urban art.

 Knitta 
wiki:wikipedia:knitta Knitta, also known as Urban Knitting (or knitted graffiti), is knitted yarn done in public places over public objects. There is one piece done on a bike rack in front of Hart Hall. Here are more examples (note what happens when a bicycle gets attacked): http://www.crookedbrains.net/2009/01/knitting.html

The bridge under the I80/Highway 113 interchange over Putah Creek used to be a very famous graffiti spot until about 4 years ago.  You can access it by heading out towards the Hydraulics Lab south of the Vet hospital and Unitrans depot.  It is also south of the Center for Aquatic Biology and Aquaculture (CABA).  Local writers DEOne, SteveOne, Dawns, Erekt, Phlower, Bfore, and even such SF artists as Giant, Bukue, SetOne, and Leks and others used to kill the walls out there every weekend, drink beer, build skate ramps, blast metal, and generally have a good time.  You can see most of this work documented on Susan Farells site graffiti.org.  This was all fun and games until an alert CHP officer saw me painting in the middle of the day and pulled his gun on me.  Graffiti spot no longer.  All the walls have been sandblasted.... :(   (Mr. JeffSpeckles aka SteveOne SBS HNR, freight train killer 19962005 and beyond)

For an ever changing display of graffiti, head over to the train tracks along 2nd Street near the Davis Police Department Police Station. The freight trains there park for a while, displaying many vast murals of well executed graffiti art. Of course, where there is good work, there is also bad, but typically one can spot many multicolored banners mixed in with the typical tags.


Photo Request: There is some nice graffiti on an old trailer next to the Davis Park and Ride parking lot behind Ikedas.  I saw it one day when I didnt have my camera and I havent had a chance to make it back.  Anyone?

 Stenciled 
 Stencil Series 

There seems to be a series of stencils in Davis produced by the same group or at least in a very similar style. They have been found all around town, including on Campus and the part of Downtown closest to Campus.

California Aggie columnist Ian Watson http://www.californiaaggie.com/news/2005/02/22/Features/Finally.Time.For.A.Rant1319654.shtml ranted about these stencils, especially because one appeared on the Death Star.  It is rumored that many of these stencils are painted by the International Socialist Organization. The others in the series are:

 Stencil Status 

Many of the original stencils are now painted over.  The city seems to be using bright silver paint to cover some of them, which makes for some really ugly sidewalk. So what you do is stencil many of them in a pattern so that when they silver paint over them it makes a large face or such.


I hate to be a stickler but the one on the pillar of the art building is actually a silkscreen. You can make the argument that a silkscreen is a stencil but it is not a stencil in the same form as all the other ones on this page. Also, Im sure there is other Urban Art in this town besides stencils. Maybe someone can contribute some of these other mediums? Users/GracielaGuardado
  True, theres a ton of interesting spray paint graffiti. Esp. on the trains, Mystery Picture/History has one from The Foundation

20050717 16:58:43 nbsp Does anybody have any pictures of the Evangelions that used to be on the Orchard Park Overpass? Users/NickSchmalenberger

20050912 13:32:00 nbsp on the Death Star theres another stencil, a womans face in a box that looks like its suppose to house a light to light the floor, i would have taken a picture but we couldnt really stop Users/MichelleAccurso

20051029 13:01:34 nbsp Another neat stencil art image was the Samus stencil. Any pictures? Its painted over now, unfourtunately. Users/MatthewTom

20051106 22:54:36 nbsp I thought it was an Evangelion, but maybe it is Samus. From Metroid right? I have pictures. Ill post them when I get the film scanned. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20060106 23:18:26 nbsp is it so wrong that i wish there was more graffiti around to photograph? i adore urban art Users/MichelleAccurso

20060112 11:44:34 nbsp Take the train down to Berkeley and look on the east (and west too) side of the tracks. Between Richmond and Emeryville you will see tons of nice stuff.  Graffiti tends to be concentrated around train yards and tracks, construction sites, and freeways in urban areas. Users/JeffSpeckles

20060204 06:04:07 nbsp I <3 Users/MarieHuynh

20060304 00:35:27 nbsp A neat book to check out is Graffiti world by Nicholas Ganz. I like a lot of the character artists in there. I particularly like Kid Acne and Cha. The reason why you see a lot of writing on the trainyards is because trains travel a lot, and therefore provide a wider audience for the writer.   Users/MatthewTom

20060304 00:39:58 nbsp BTW, does anyone know what Achilles Snap means? Its not art, but I see that message every morning... Users/MatthewTom

20070328 07:40:32 nbsp The back of one of the design bungalos next to Walker Hall was there before August/Sept. but I dont remember how long before. Users/MarieHuynh

20070502 16:47:28 nbsp I periodically see tags from fairly notable tagging crews on trains in Davis and Woodland.  It always impresses me. Users/BrianTrott

20070524 21:34:04 nbsp There is a cool stencil of a Garden gnome throwing a molotov cocktail on a dumpster at the corner of 8th and h. I dont have a digital camera or I would post it. It reminds me of the work of Banksy every time I see it. Users/Dimitri

20070615 01:36:37 nbsp Dunno if its still there but I loved the stencil of a pair of scissors cutting part of freeborn hall off  it was artfully placed.   Users/AynReyes

20070710 08:21:00 nbsp I dont mean to be too negative or anything, but whoever made the Chuck Norris, Andre the Giant, John Lennon and Bob Marley stencils, needs to get some new material.  That shits majorly cliche.  Oh, and we need to put more freehand tagging in this section.  Last thing, quit talking about Banksy.  That guys like a monolith of talent that overshadows a lot of other great artists.  Plus, hes like the Tony Hawk of graffiti.  Okay Im done. Users/BrianTrott

20080324 01:10:17 nbsp I really appreciated the freehand monster that appeared on the south side of Big 5 in the marketplace.  It was covered up recently, but it had a good run.   Users/AynReyes

20090512 11:16:09 nbsp The freehand monster was a good concept but it wasnt as good as it could have been. Kinda sloppy, but a good idea. And good placement, too, if youre into that sort of thing. Users/JohnDudek

20110707 13:37:41 nbsp the putah creek bike tunnel behind borders has had some pretty lame spray paint stuff on it but there have been some cool paint splatter of different colors that look amazing Users/JustinYoder

20110823 22:27:07 nbsp Maybe stenciling needs its own page. Its barely art and its distracting people from a lot of the awesome crap out there. Like the picture I just posted of someones graffiti underneath Pedrick Bridge. Take a deep breath and check it out, its some aweinspiring stuff. Its got at least two angry owls, Big Bird (possibly a pterodactyl), two Salvador Daliesque elephant/wolf/face/stars, the words sex and ape appearing several times, and a pretty good sized marijuana leaf in the bottom right corner. I get flustered trying to take it all in. And then I think man, this guy or girl dragged a huge ladder down here to do this. Mind blowing. I think the angry owls represent the dichotomous nature of knowledge. Or the dichotomy of something else. Big Bird seems pretty omnipotent, like a benevolent creator. But then it looks like he has a claw and you have to wonder, Is that a pterodactyl? Is it? Users/MikeyCrews

20110928 12:14:12 nbsp In the photo Under Pedrick Bridge theres a big yellow figure, Ive seen his work pop up on I80 overpass near Mace, and on the I80 and CA113 junction. They were there for a couple weeks before they got painted over, too bad no one got a picture of them.  Users/SamChieh

20111012 20:27:14 nbsp Yea I saw some similar designs under the I80 bridge about a month ago but they had all been blemished with other, less talented peoples work. Hopefully the bigbird artist gets back at it soon. Users/MikeyCrews

20120207 01:21:45 nbsp Adding googly eyes to stuff is funny. Users/MikeyCrews
