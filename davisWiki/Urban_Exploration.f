Some adventurous types like to investigate the hidden or (frequently) offlimits areas of infrastructure in and around Davis.  These places include utility tunnels, rooftops, abandoned buildings, and sewers.  While, technically speaking, this activity often involves trespassing, ethical urban explorers are most often like oldschool hackers in that they intend to do no damage and only learn more about interesting places.  This isnt to say that its not dangerous.  For more information in this pursuit in general, see the wiki:WikiPedia:Urban_Exploration article on Wikepedia.
