Winter 2007 Candidate Statement

Hi everyone! My name is Usenima Inyang and I am a 3rd year undergrad from Sacramento, CA. I am currently doublemajoring in Community & Regional Development (w/ emphasis in Education and Law & Policy) and African & African American Studies. After undergrad, I plan to attain my teaching credential, become a teacher in the California K12 public school system and eventually attend law school and work towards educational policy reform in California. I am running for ASUCD Senate because it is important for ASUCD, an organization that represents the UCD student population, to continue and increase support of student groups and centers on campus that foster recruitment and retention of underserved and underrepresented communities. Due to the continual increase in student fees, lower financial aid availability, and various campus and city climate issues, many students struggle academically. It is important that ASUCD actively lobbies for a better campus climate and a more enjoyable and attainable college experience for all students whether they are historically or economically underserved, physically or mentally impaired, homeless, undocumented, etc.
