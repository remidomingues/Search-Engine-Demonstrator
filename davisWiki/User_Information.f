Today I received an email from Users/NicholasBarry regarding the SacWiki meetup.  Now, to be clear, I am interested in the new software and the meetup, and I certainly dont mind an email from Nicholas or anyone else.  If I did, I wouldnt have posted my email address.  What concerns me is that the email went to the address I used to sign up for the wiki, not to the one I put on my user page or even the one I used for LocalWiki donations.  While I dont mind receiving email there (it all gets forwarded to the same place), Im concerned with the methodology here.  In an era when people are up in arms about privacy concerns on Facebook, Google, and elsewhere, the Wiki should be responsible with its users privacy and its own internal policies.

How did the email list for that email get compiled?  Who has access to it?  Who can gain access to it, and how?  What are the policies regarding its use?  I dont recall any privacy notice when signing up for the wiki (or when making a certain troll account (cough)).  Something about this just feels off to me.

Again, this isnt a complaint about Nicholas emailing me, or about the meetup.  Im concerned with the way user information is being handled.

xA quick update... the User Settings page on WikiSpot where you signup has apparently been changed quite a bit behind the scenes.  I could have sworn it used to say your email wont be used for anything except to retrieve your password at one point.  Now, the Info for that page shows 4 versions.  Those versions dont include the current version, or the previous version which (I thought) said something about not using your email address.  Changes have been made and apparently memory holed.  Philip, can you fill us in on whats going on?x
Scratch all that.  It looks like it retrieves a form from wikispot when signing up for a new account.  Not a memory hole, just a behind the scenes change to the form.  Still wondering whats going on.

And one other concern which multiple have mentioned in offwiki conversations, and which JW alluded to below: what does this mean for people who are using pseudonyms on the wiki?  If they signed up using a nonanonymous email address, are they still anonymous?  Who has access to the information, since it looks like its not just people with database access?

Im sure Daubert isnt the only one who thinks this is trivial, and Im not personally affected by it in any negative way.  What Im concerned about is the way in which peoples personal information is being used.
 Users/TomGarberson
 its a conspiracy to keep you informed, you had better get to the bottom of this Daubert
    Heh. Just asking questions; the email addresses were promised never to be used at some point, so its odd to see them used, and its reasonable to be concerned who has them now that they are out there.  Questions arent a bad thing.  Honestly, my concern is the signup statement (probably not really answerable) and making sure that nobodys anonymity was potentially compromised (which is probably important to answer).   Your mileage may vary. jw
    Its spam. When I signed up, I never agreed to have my email address added to any mailing list. It doesnt cease to be spam just because it was done once. Also, my information was turned over to a THIRD PARTY who then entered it into governmentownedandcontrolled computers. Somebody has some serious explaining to do.  Users/WilliamLewis

For me, it went to a unique email address I have only ever used for signing up to Davis Wiki (I use a different email for each site to track spam sources), so it was clearly a database dump.  Normally, if it is used for spam, I ditch the site.  xAlso it seems that the old notice promising never to use your email for anything but password recovery seems to have been removed and is not visible in the history of the current page.  I clearly remember such a notice.x (See above  it was code, not content, so changed by a developer at some point)

Im also concerned because people who signed up under anonymous names seem to have been emailed.    In addition to the above questions, how many people got emailed?  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards



The reason why some DavisWiki editors got an email is because DavisWiki accounts are actually global wikispot.org accounts.  So when we migrated the Sacramento Wiki database information into the new LocalWiki system we picked which users to migrate over based on a simple heuristic: has this user edited Sacramento Wiki?  If so, migrate them over.  A bit wonky, Ill admit.

The SacWiki user information is hosted on our servers (and always has been).  Nicholas (the current SacWiki administrator) has access to the list of email addresses associated with editors via the new administrative interface.  He was given access to this interface by me with full authorization.

Itd be good to clarify this stuff to avoid issues like this in the future.  Anyone want to take a stab at writing a Privacy policy?  Weve tried a few times before but never got anywhere.  It would also be good to clarify, during signup, whether or not people want to receive occasional emails about the projects.

Ive told Nick to refrain from any more emails until we have a better policy and plan for this sort of thing.  Users/PhilipNeustrom
 This is unacceptable. Nick needs to purge this list from any legislative computers he may have used to send out the emails and destroy any mailing lists he created. Then, his access to email addresses needs to be revoked. When we signed up, we never agreed to be emailed for any reasons other than a password reset. He should have never had access to these email addresses. He should not have abused his illgotten access to spam people.  Users/WilliamLewis

    Nick isnt some random viagra company we sold email addresses to  he was put in charge of the SacWiki initiative.  Also, he didnt spam people  he told them about a relevant event (the first in years!) in a project they participated with in the past.  People didnt ask to be emailed, and that kind of sucks.  But we dont have any way of knowing that right now  so lets fix that problem and talk about solutions so this sort of confusion / situation doesnt happen again.  Ive written up a proposal at the bottom of this page.  Users/PhilipNeustrom
      Unsolicited mass email is the definition of spam. This was unsolicited. It was a mass email. Nick is a spammer. wl

        While people didnt optin to getting emails about Sacramento Wiki events, and I agree that it sucks, that doesnt make a relevant email spam.  Also, Im not sure why you are being so antagonist here.  Users/PhilipNeustrom
         Spam: the unsolicited transmission mass transmission of email. Spammer: One who sends spam. The message was a mass mailing and it was unsolicited. Therefore, it was spam. Nick sent this spam. Therefore, Nick is a spammer. Youre wrong.  Users/WilliamLewis
           While youre obviously upset about getting an email from Nick, I think itd be good to realize that were trying to improve things here.  Nicks intentions  to make SacWiki better  are good.  And I think good faith should be assumed here.  Calling Nick a spammer doesnt help and makes it look like youre just trying to start a fight.   Users/PhilipNeustrom
            I get emails from people trying to buy the books that publishers send me.  A lot of faculty like this service, so one could say that the people who send these emails are wellintentioned.  Their good intentions dont change the fact that its spam.  It was wrong for him to have been given the emails, and it was wrong for him to use them in that way.   Users/CovertProfessor
            The road to hell is paved with good intentions. You created a thread on hacker news a few months ago about how wrong it was that a certain yc funded startup was engaging in spam. Im sure they had good intentions, too. Save people money. Make money themselves. Give students jobs. It doesnt change the fact that there and here, nobody consented to receive these mass mailings. Relevance is irrelevant. Im not trying to start a fight here. I just want this remedied. You are not taking this seriously and thats discouraging. There is also the issue of disclosure of this information to third parties. I dont care that Nick is an admin. It was the case that unless an admin also had database access, they had no access to email addresses. Things changed and we had no say in that. He then proceeded to export email addresses en mass to another third party, in this case the State of California. I specified what needs to be done above. 1. The mailing lists used to send these messages must be deleted. 2. All traces of these email addresses must be removed from the government systems used to send this email blast. 3. Admins, and Nick in particular, need to no longer have access to any email address that users did not choose to share with administrators of local wikis.  Users/WilliamLewis
               I am taking this seriously  thats why Im discussing it and wrote up a proposal at the bottom of the page here.  I disagree that this was spam, though.  Relevance and relationship is actually not irrelevant to whether or not something is spam  its literally the thing that defines whether or not something is spam.  In the case of that one spammer I was upset with a few months back, they were scraping @ucdavis.edu emails from sites and sending out emails indiscriminately.  In this case, a single email was sent to users of a site who provided their email address about that site.

              That said, it sucks we dont have an optin at signup.  Ive asked Nick to delete the mailing list he created, as you requested.  And unless anyone objects Ill follow through with the proposal at the bottom of this page. Users/PhilipNeustrom
               Spam is defined by consent. This relationship and relevance stuff is made up by people who spam and want to rationalize their spamming. Virtually every AUP prohibits UNSOLICITED email, not irrelevant email or email from someone you dont have a relationship with. This blast would have been prohibited by all reputable ESPs. Until you stop rationalizing this spam as not spam and apologize for enabling this spamming and breach of privacy, you are not taking this seriously.  Users/WilliamLewis

  I agree.  And I dont see the justification for moving the email addresses to SacWiki in the first place.  We never agreed to that.  A message could have gone out on Davis Wiki and SacWiki, asking interested parties to optin.  Users/CovertProfessor


 Proposal 

  1. Draft up a Privacy policy for DavisWiki / other local wiki projects to explain how user data is used.  (Weve never had one before)
  2. When signing up, ask if someone wants to receive very occasional emails about the project.  If they dont optin, dont email them for anything except password reset and user notifications.
  3. XSend an optin email to users when they are migrated to a new system asking them if theyd like to receive said emails.X  Have a dialog at some point temporarily appear that asks people (once) if theyd like to optin for emails, or have some kind of user setting for this.

 Users/PhilipNeustrom
   I dont think new users should be migrated to a new system without their permission.  When I signed up for DW, I thought I was signing up for DW only.  I later found out that I could edit other wikis, but I never thought I had any association with them.  It boggles my mind to think my email could be migrated to any wikispot wiki.  Im glad I didnt edit more of them.   Users/CovertProfessor
    Seconded. Anyone who did not explicitly consent to have their information transferred to the new system (and thus accessible to third parties, such as local admins) should have their email addresses purged from the new system.  Users/WilliamLewis

    If we didnt import user information then: 1) users wouldnt be able to log in 2) edit history wouldnt be preserved.  Users/PhilipNeustrom
     Again, you could post information to various relevant wikis, asking users if they wanted their user info to be transferred.  I dont see how edit history is affected.   Users/CovertProfessor
      When you make edits, they are associated with a specific account. If the account is missing, the software gets confused. But just because the user accounts need to be migrated doesnt mean the emails have to (unless the database design is seriously flawed). And if the emails are to be migrated, that doesnt mean admins have to have access to them. Users/WilliamLewis
        Unfortunately, the only thing we have that allows a user to authenticate is their email address.  We could do an import of users without email addresses but then itd be practically impossible to claim your account or log in.  But it seems like the real issue here is admins access to email addresses (which Ive commented on below).  Users/PhilipNeustrom
         That is only one of the issues here.  I do not want my email address spread to other wikis.  I did not agree to have my email address spread to other wikis.  The fact that there was no privacy policy does not justify your actions; youve been around the Internet long enough to know better.  I dont care about Sac Wiki.  You see wiki spot users, but I am just a Davis Wiki user.  You seem to refuse to admit that you might have done anything wrong, and seem to be judging by whats best for the Sac Wiki and other wikis, rather than listen to those of us who are upset.  And justifiably so, imo.   Users/CovertProfessor

             Hate to break it to you good professor, but This is a Wiki Spot wiki. Wiki Spot is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization that helps communities collaborate via wikis.  Furthermore, you should come to the wikiBBQ I for one am very interested in the issues at hand but find I find myself irresolute to continue this discussion in such a flat, drawn out format (online text). Daubert

             The problem is that the way the user system on wikispot.org is structured everything is global.  For instance, if you look at the User Statistics page on a given wiki it will list all users whove edited the wiki.  So when we decide what accounts to import into an instance thats the logic we use.

             I am listening to your concerns.  Im not sure why you dont think I am.  Ive been on here for the past several hours responding to every query thats been made, Ive formulated a proposal to alleviate this problem in the future and Im planning to explore possible technical solutions to the admin viewing email addresess issue.  However, if you cant continue to discuss this in a civil manner then Im not interested in continuing dialog with you.  Users/PhilipNeustrom

               Youve continued to defend, and not apologized for, transferring the emails to Sac Wiki.  Youve continued to defend, and not apologized for, your role in the subsequent emails that were sent out, namely, making the emails available to NB.  Youve even defended his sending out the emails.  Under these circumstances, I dont see any point in continuing to dialogue with you, either.  I also have completely lost confidence in this wikis commitment to user privacy and ethical practice.  Let me be clear that this is not about my own privacy.  The email address I used isnt one I care about.  This is about an organization that claims to be one of the good guys while acting like the bad guys.  At this point, I am feeling as though I can no longer be associated with such an organization.  Im going to give it a day or so; if I still feel then the way I do today, I will delete my account. Users/CovertProfessor

               Speaking for myself, its hard to take you seriously when you deny that Nick spammed us, coming up with some bullshit definition of spam that uses lack of a relationship instead of lack of consent. Its also hard to take you seriously when you refuse to acknowledge how screwed up it is that Nick was able to take our information and transfer it to a third party. Users/WilliamLewis

                 I dont deny Nick sent an email without an explicit optin (because we never had one).  But it was not spam.

                 As far as transfering information to a third party, thats where I think writing up a privacy policy would be helpful.  For instance, would you consider importing email addresses into http://mailchimp.com mailchimp a third party?  Or a google apps contact list?  Because thats basically what was done here: he imported them into a mailing list system (or probably just used iContact or something, I have no idea).  These are good questions and thats why I think writing a privacy policy would be smart. Users/PhilipNeustrom
                  Its spam. Im sorry you disagree, but it is spam. In the absence of agreement on what constitutes spam, could you agree to the following? Sending mass email without an explicit optin is wrong no matter the circumstances and no matter the intentions and wiki spot will never do it nor enable anyone to do it again.
                  As for the third parties, yes, google apps contact list counts. Mailchimp counts. iContact counts. The user email database should have never been copied off of wiki spot servers. Consent to be added to a mailing list can reasonably imply consent to use third party mail service providers. Consent to use email addresses for password resets and the like cant.  Users/WilliamLewis

  I think #1 and #2 are a good start.  I dont like #3.  Add a checkbox for User Settings so people can opt in on existing accounts.  Possibly, add a notification onscreen for the first time someone logs in that gives a heads up.  Big things are afoot!  Do you want to occasional email alerts about changes to your wiki community?  Click here and check the notifications box to opt in!  Dont send more unsolicited emails to see if people want further unsolicited emails.  Regarding the privacy policy, its not something Ill have time to work on in the next week and a half, but if its still untouched then Ill try to take a stab at it. Users/TomGarberson
     Okay, that makes sense.  So lets axe #3 and go with something along the lines of what you mentioned (a notice onsite for optin of existing users).   Users/PhilipNeustrom

Do administrators for all wikispot wikis have access to user information (emails and whatever else may be stored) for all users that edit those wikis?  Or is it something that was done specifically for SacWiki? Users/TomGarberson
 No. Only administrators of wiki spot wikis that have been migrated over to local wiki (sf, sac, a few others) have access to this information. If the wiki is still running on sycamore (what dwiki is using), they do not have access to any user information the public does not.  Users/WilliamLewis
    William is correct.  Im going to chat with Mike tomorrow about possible technical changes here.  We may be able to make it so if someones an admin they cant necessarily see email addresses, though there are advantages to admins being able to see email addresses.  Users/PhilipNeustrom

Tom was probably right to bring this up.  Some people were not expecting emails.  The proposal sounds like a decent solution though, and I would think it should clear up the problem. Other than that, I personally didnt have much issue with the email.  Nick was just trying to generate more editing on a wiki thats probably been needing more attention.  Weve done wiki awareness in the past, (Farmers market tabling tabling at farmers market , Wiki Sticker/StickiWiki Design Contest sticker campaigns, etc), and I thought this was just another way to get more people involved with sacwiki.  Im personally not sticking the spam label on it, but thats just me.  JT

This is a troubling turn of events, I for one would like to laud Phillip for rapidly responding to the concerns voiced and look forward to hearing the results of his discussion with Mike on the technical aspects of what allowed this to occur Daubert

Agreed.  Nobody is perfect and Nick made a mistake with the email, but Phillip is making a solid effort to fix it here.  Lets give him some space.  JT
    Ive met Philip in person, I love the wiki concept, and overall I know theres good intentions all around.  I agree that hes looking to improve a future slip, but I feel like were glazing over the real issue which occurred in the past sometime.   Part 1: I signup where it says your email address will never be used for anything, ever.  Sometime later, part 2, it is used.  Period.   The questions raised in the first few comments are very accurate: how, why, by who, etc. Those have been somewhat answered (but not the ones on how anonymous are people who used a nonanonymous email, or JWs comment on how many people were emailed).   But I agree with William, that it is spam.  To say its not, Philip, is trivializing it.  Its no less spam than a company website emailing me to tell them about their new product, because I was interested in their old one.  It seems like semantics or nitpicking, but its not.  Because to think its not spam comes across up above as it shouldnt have happened, but its not that bad.  Or as Philip specifically said, its not as if its a viagra company.  But thats completely skipping the fundamental point:  when most of us signed up, we were assured our email address never would be used for anything.  It was.   Thats where the disconnect is.  (By the way, Ive been in LA for a few years now, so a come on over and hang out in Sacramento email does seem pretty strange and not relevant at all to me).  I also found it odd that it came from an official .gov email address, but I wont touch on those points.   To comment on Dauberts post, its not entirely Nicholass fault for sending the email; actually, if Nicholas hadnt emailed, we would never have known that our emails were accessible to others or would have been eligible for recieving email.   The fault is ultimately Philip/Mike/whomever for the way the system changed, and for not informing anyone of this explicitly (or else the email wouldnt have gotten this surprised response).  The email was simply what brought attention to it.   Also, in the email he had written that these emails wouldnt be sent out often  that implied that the email list may/would be used again.  I dont blame Nicholas for that, to him it was a useful tool to spread the word.  But the fault lies with those who created the tool, when the DavisWiki foundation had started with your email will never be used.
   I know it was an accidental oversight, obviously not meant maliciously, but still.  Im seeing Philip address the future occurrences by starting a policy proposal, which is great.  This should be done, absolutely. Lets all agree on how this tool should/shouldnt be used in the future.   But what I dont see in the first series of comments (or really in the later) is him apologizing for or condemning the lapse in security/the broken promise.  Instead, its downplaying the impact of the email. This discounts concerns people raised, which is why CP seems irked, if he excuses me saying so.  Or WL, in the spam or not chain.    Its like saying at least the tool was used by a wiki admin, not a viagra company when everyone elses concern is focused on this tool we were explicitly told would never exist.   users/edwins ES
   I guess I was responding to the level of negativity that spilled out here last night.  I understand people are upset, but a lot of it had become counterproductive.  JT


Hey, all  Im sorry! I made a mistake, and I owe an apology. Even discussion of privacy/consent/etc. aside, it was clearly a mistake for me to send out the email given how much concern it has created. I should have discussed the idea of sending out an email with a few more people, who probably would have convinced me that sending it out was not a good idea.

I felt at the time of sending that an administrator sending an email to users of a site wouldnt constitute a breach of privacy  you sign up with an email address, which is inherently a way of being contacted, and that users should expect that administrators of a site would have access to that information. But I agree with the concerns of many that (1) the email was not consented to, and (2) some Daviswiki users were ported over to Sacwiki, and therefore didnt even expect that a Sacwiki editor would have access to their email address. So again, I apologize. I shouldnt have sent the email. I should have stuck to other methods of getting the word out about the edit party.

To clarify, I did not create a mailing list  I just copied the email addresses from the database into the BCC line of an email. Ill delete the Sent email from my computer at work. (I sent it from work because all my work on Sacwiki has been part of my job  Ive taken it on as a project to improve the Sacwiki as a constituent service for Sacramentans.)

I agree that we should develop a privacy policy, and I should have waited until there was discussion about this before sending. One thing that I see as extremely useful about allowing admins to access email addresses is that frequently Ill see new users make mistakes that need to be corrected. Usually other editors will just jump in and correct them, but occasionally the new user gets into an edit war because they think other editors are malicious. Often the new editor doesnt understand how to view the pages history and doesnt view their own user page (or even know it exists), so theyre not able to see the friendly messages other editors are leaving them about why the new editors edits are being undone/changed. As an admin who is trying to encourage lots of people to get engaged with the wiki, Id really like to be able to shoot an email to the new editor saying, Hey, you should check out your user page, thats where people are going to leave you messages explaining why theyre undoing your edits. So if we have a policy that bans mass emails except for those who have opted into receiving site emails (which, given the debate above, Id now be in favor of), I will still lobby for the right of admins to message individuals under select circumstances, e.g. in the circumstances Ive just described.

Again, my apologies. Drop me a line at my user page if you want to, though Ill also continue to follow things here. (Thanks for the call last night alerting me of all the discussion going on here, Daubert.)
 Users/NicholasBarry



First off, I want to apologize.  It was a mistake that Nick sent out those emails and I apologize that circumstances allowed it.  It shouldnt have happened and it wont happen again.  After talking to Mike about this, heres what weve done and plan to do:

  1. Draft up a Privacy policy for DavisWiki / other local wiki projects to explain how user data is used.  Weve never had one before.  Theres a lot of things that could be confusing or surprising to people.  For instance, we publicly display IP addresses of editors, which might surprise people.  Drafting this gives us an opportunity to nail this down.
  2. We have removed the ability of admins to view email addresses in the administrative interface.  This makes contacting editors harder, and makes fixing peoples email addresses for them difficult, but we need to add a user notification system to alleviate this anyway.
  3. When signing up on a new system, well ask if someone wants to receive very occasional emails about the project.  If they dont optin, we wont email them for anything except password resets and user notifications (and well allow the notification emails to be turned off).  For existing users, well allow them to set optin to Yes in their user settings, and maybe display a message the first time they visit a new system.
