20070609 23:08:32 nbsp Getting the proofs and my first order was quick and timely just as they said. I put in reorders midMay. I called yesterday and apparently theyll be ready in JULY. Not 710 business days but 710 WEEKS. Theyll be nice the first time but screw you over the second. And theyre incredibly expensive. Now that people do not have to go to them for yearbook pictures, I suggest shopping around or borrowing friends old cap and gowns and taking your own pictures. Users/JoAnnaRich

20070814 15:21:33 nbsp This place sucks. The main photographer does not know how to take pictures. She counts on luck to get the decent pictures. Theyre over priced! Highly do not recommend. Sears Portraits, J.C Penny or even Walmart is better and cheaper than this place!!! They charged me $50 claiming that I did not returned my proofs, when I PERSONALLY walked it in! B.S Studios is what this place should be called. Users/Sam

20071013 23:38:14 nbsp I noticed that someone (probably a representative of VIP Portraits) made a http://daviswiki.org/VIP_Portraits?actiondiff&version211&version110 copyrightrelated edit on this page today.

When my wife and I got married in mid2006, we retained copyright to our wedding photos by paying extra and granting the photographer permission to use the photos for her business purposes.  She definitely wasnt thrilled about the arrangement, but I wasnt willing to ask anyone but my wife for permission to use our wedding photos as I saw fit.  Plus, I think she (the photographer) reluctantly recognized that this is the path down which progress is taking us.

I havent worked with this studio (VIP Portraits), but if like me youre unwilling to pay for photos for which you dont retain copyright, you might try negotiating.   Very little is ever set in stone, and persistence and chisels can take care of that which is set in stone.  :)

20071127 13:57:06 nbsp Im a UC Davis Alumni and over the past years, Ive seen my friends photos taken at this studio, V.I.P. Studios and Ive been very impressed time after time. My friends print quality are very professional looking and they were posed professionally in the photos. You dont get these qualities by getting your photos taken at the mall or the stores like WalMart. The prices that my friends paid for their high quality prints at V.I.P. Studios were exceptionally reasonable. Based on the quality of work and services that Ive seen my friends get from this studio, I would highly recommend anyone have their senior portraits done at V.I.P. Users/StephenH

20080307 16:02:46 nbsp My roommate just showed me her senior portraits, and I was very impressed. The poses and expressions were natural and the picture quality was fantastic! I am graduating in the spring of 2008 and I will definitely be going to VIP Studios.  My roommate recommends this photographer to all of our friends who are graduating if they want to have a fun, laid back shoot that produces awesome photos.   Users/kikiwiki

20080406 21:49:03 nbsp I just got my senior pictures taken and it was a great experience. I hate getting pictures done but the environment was comfortable and the photographer was very professional and yet still hilarious. She also was open to how I wanted to be photographed. I just received my proofs about a week after my photos were taken and I have so many shots to choose from. Recommended if you want high quality photos and not cheap prints like you get from the mall.  Users/WendyWoo

20080415 23:49:31 nbsp Had my sitting today and found it to be quick and pleasant.  The photographer actually listened to what kind of poses I wanted, and let me pick out props and say no to ones I didnt like.  Ive been places before that tell YOU what to do for your own picture and thats no fun.  I would recommend them for portraits if youre looking for a place with a more personal feel.  Users/AynReyes

20080515 19:29:45 nbsp I had a terrible experience here.  The photographer was rude, she didnt ask me anything about what I wanted and made me feel really uncomfortable, which showed in the pictures.  I would not recommend this studio. Users/ShanaRose

20080609 19:17:48 nbsp I took my senior portraits in April, everyone at the studio was so friendly. I recieved my proofs in a week and as soon as I got my order in I recieved my prints in 3 weeks. The time that everything took was all expected because it says all that on the order form, nothing was late. My prints came out great and they look way better than anything I could have pulled off. When I first looked at the order I was a little overwhelmed with the prices, but I feel like I really got what I paid for when I look at how nice the quality of the prints came out. Plus they were very nice to me about editing one of my poses because I didnt like the background color. The photographer knows exactly what shes doing. Ill be using this studio again. Users/Adaleen

20080609 21:39:28 nbsp Evil. Im sorry, but she screwed over Unitrans BIG TIME a few years ago. The picture quality was terrible, and when I asked for a reprint because you couldnt see faces, she asked me what my opinion mattered. When I told her my employees didnt want the pictures they paid for because they were terrible and it wasnt just what I thought, she said that in the grand scheme of things, the $20 each person paid for the pictures didnt matter. YOU DONT SAY THAT IF YOURE IN BUSINESS. She ended up not talking to me because Im a student, and would only do business with my General Manager. She eventually gave us reprints, except that it turns out she took a terrible picture to begin with so she only argued because she couldnt do any better. Big bummer. Big, big bummer. She wouldnt work with any of my coworkers, either, because were students and beneath her.  Users/ChristyMarsden

20080611 19:29:44 nbsp I totally recommend this place for senior portraits! I was surprised to see how fast they gave me my order. They are also very friendly and will do anything to help. For example, there was a problem with two of my pictures and they simply reordered them and I got them in 3 days. The photographer is so friendly and made me feel comfortable during the photo session. The results were great! The photos are very high quality. For example, the paper is very nice and so is the retouching. I have no complaints! Users/leahgue

20080807 14:27:08 nbsp I came to vip studios in june to get my grad photos and had a great experience overall. The staff was helpful and had my pictures ready in a resonable amount of time. I was very pleased with the quality of the photos and was happy to hand them out. Looking at all the photos in the studio i would definitely reccommend this place to families and other graduating seniors. The photographer is also good at positionig you for great shot.

20110701 14:17:32 nbsp Pretty efficient.  However, I felt that my photo was a bit too retouched because my teeth were a bit too white.  Other than that, I have no complaints. Users/ConnieP

20110701 14:29:51 nbsp I called a few days before my actual appointment and they were nice about letting me reschedule another time.  The photographer was funny and she try to loosen me up, she even let me look at pictures after taking it.  When I did not like it, she let me retake it.  The proof came in 1 week from the time I took the pictures, so it wasnt too bad.      Users/LisaChu

20110704 17:39:52 nbsp I got my graduation pictures taken with VIP Studios.  They looked wonderful.  There were many different proofs to choose from.  The turnaround for proofs and the pictures were quick.   Users/kchen

20110705 12:48:47 nbsp The proofs came really quickly and so did my order which I had delivered to my house. The only bad thing I would say is that they are not open on the weekends and there isnt any mailbox for you to drop off your proofs/order so I had to pay USPS to ship it. But overall a nice pic end with UCD. Users/conntang

20110705 13:52:01 nbsp I took my graduation photos here and had a pleasant experience.  The quality of the pictures undoubtedly exceeded my expecatations. Ara was very friendly and attentive during my photo session.  She took a lot of pictures of me using a variety of poses, props, and backgrounds.  I received my proofs just a few days after my photo session, which was great because I needed to place my order just before graduation. I had so many great proofs/prints to choose from that I had a difficult time narrowing them down to a few. I had a lot of questions regarding my order and pricing and everytime I received the assistance I needed. All of my family and friends were very impresses with my nice, professional graduation portraits. Thanks VIP Studios! Users/Cogaz

20110708 13:31:50 nbsp I am pleased with V.I.P. Studios Photography. The staff is really friendly and courteous. One need not be afraid to ask questions. Aria, the photographer, was nice as well. She tried to make the photo shoot as fun as possible by making conversation and by making a positive environment. (I forgot which song, but a sad Rhianna song started to play on the radio. As a result, she had the lady at the front desk change it.) As for the work, I wasnt pleased with 50% of my proofs at first. They looked like they were of low quality. However, when I picked up the pictures that I ordered, I was amazed! They turned out 100% better than what they looked like on the proofs. That made me happy. i must admit that the pictures are somewhat pricey, but since they are college senior pictures, I can see how its worth it. I would definitely recommend this studio. One thing I would like to note though is follow up on your order. The lady who I ordered pictures with told me that my order would be done in two weeks. but i didnt receive then until the fourth week after i initially ordered. i think the policy is that the pictures would be done 25 weeks after the orders are made; but i felt since she told me an approximate time, it would have been nice if someone called me to let me know the status of my order.

20110711 12:46:55 nbsp I decided to get my senior portrait done after graduation when I had more time. V.I.P.s online appointment setup is easy to use, and my actual appointment went smoothly and quickly.  The photographer, Ara, is extremely friendly and clearly knows what shes doing!  The turnaround time for the proofs was pretty quick, and I had a hard time choosing which pose I liked best!  When the portraits came in two weeks later, I was pleased with the retouching job she had done on the stray hairs around my neck.  My parents love the finished product, and Im really pleased I chose to capture the end of my Davis career with a senior portrait!  Users/SamanthaDullea

20110725 14:43:14 nbsp My experience with VIP Studios was fantastic. I felt kind of awkward going into the appointment and was afraid that I was going to end up with tons of pictures with fake smiles but Ara made me feel totally comfortable. I ended up with a bunch of great photos in a variety of poses to choose from. I received my proofs and following prints very quickly and can honestly say I was completely satisfied with all my interactions with VIP Studios.  Users/StephanieVilla

20110727 20:25:44 nbsp I came here for taking senior portraits. When I received my order of picture, there was a faint print mark on the picture, so I brought it in and informed them to see if I can get a replacement. They were really nice about it and processed a new order for me right away. Overall, I had a nice experience with VIP. The ladies there are pretty cool too ) Great place near campus for taking senior portraits! Users/CZhou

20110729 09:29:07 nbsp I received my portraits recently and I am very, very satisfied.  They are good quality, and they did a wonderful job with touchups!  Ive received many compliments from many friends, and I am recommending the studio to friends already.  One dislike: too much of a jokester and/or inappropriate jokes and comments.  I left the photo shoot feeling uncomfortable and just glad it was done.  I would suggest an improvement in that area.  The portraits, however, are awesome, and so was the time of delivery.  It overrides any discomfort from the photo shoot and makes me want to consider going to VIP for my next event.  It is pricey, but to me it was worth it. Users/AnkoryRamirez

20110802 13:19:39 nbsp Absolutely LOVED it here. Ara is an awesome photographer, my pictures came out great. Plus shes freaking hilarious. I brought my dogs and she handled them like a champ and the photos with them came out super cute.  They were quick to call me and update me on the status of the prints. Totally recommend this place :).  Users/SamiraGhorbani

20110813 11:03:54 nbsp Taking your Grad Pics here is fast and easy. The people are friendly and helpful. Just make sure you dont drive past the house looking for something that looks like a commercial building, yes the studio is inside the house at 501 K street. Its right on the corner of K and 5th you cant miss it. Users/ScottNichols
