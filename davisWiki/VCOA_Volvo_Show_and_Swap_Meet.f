Once a year, Davis is home to the largest Volvo show and swap meet on the West Coast.  Volvo enthusiasts come together at Central Park for the VCOA Volvo Show and Swap Meet to show off their high mileage, high performance, and rare vintage models.  Over the past 10 years, the meet has grown from about 10 cars to over 120.  The show is accompanied by a raffle, a barbeque and awards

The show usually takes place in Late April or Early May, usually on Sundays.  More info can be found on http://www.ggvcoa.org/ the VCOA website.




Do you think some of the enthusiasts know where to find volvo parts? I would love to fix mine up  Users/StevenDaubert
