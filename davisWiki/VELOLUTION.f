Show Description: We are a Public Affairs show on KDVS that deals with all things bike.
We will feature weekly news items such as rides being planned, Critical mass announcements, Davis Bicycles announcements, etc.
Each week we will have a major focus item as well (see below), and the show will end with a call in time (last 15 min) for listeners with bike related questions (even mechanical ones!  Ted and Siobhan are both Ministers at the Bike Church).

Contact Davis City Council at http://www.cityofdavis.org/cmo/whoswho.cfm

Feel Free to email us questions and bike related news items/announcements and we will do our best to include them in the show!

20071016 02:23:26 nbsp We had a great time on the air yesterday with Mike and Pxl. Id love to have any comments or suggestions on how we run the show or additional topics.

In theory, you can listen to our past shows at the www.kdvs.org website.  Can anyone provide instructions on how to do this?  Thanks, Ted Buehler Users/TedBuehler

20071016 11:30:37 nbsp The streams and archives are temporarily down right now while the backend of the KDVS website gets revamped. But once that gets working and once the programming schedule gets updated with your show name instead of KDVS Public Affairs, youll click on Velolution, which will take you to your specific show page, and on the lefthand side there will be a streaming link. You can make it play in iTunes, Winamp or almost anything you want. Users/ElisaHough
