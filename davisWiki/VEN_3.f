Viticulture and Enology 3

From the catalog: Overview of the history of wine, viticulture, fermentation, winery operations, the physiology of wine consumption, wines produced in California and other major wineproducing regions and the sensory evaluation of wine.

This is a wonderful class that teaches all aspects of wine. ItÂ’s phenomenally useful if you are interested in wine or want to get into wine tasting. The class covers the varietals of wine as well as the regions of the world that produce wine.

Though it did so in the past, this class does not offer an endofyear wine tasting.
