20100111 16:07:02 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy Ms. or Mr. Wu, and Welcome to the Wiki!   You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you.  Or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here.  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  I saw you edited the ASUCD Book Exchange values, but somebody cited the budget spreadsheet, so it was switched back to the $17k figure.  If you have anything that contradicts that value, please feel free to share (I see that youre editing from somewhere on UC Davis campus, so perhaps you have more information?).  At any rate, I just wanted to let you know why the value was changed back, so you didnt think people were ignoring or discounting your contributions.  I hope youll participate in the future, and once again, welcome to the wiki! Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
