I first met Lauren in the late 90s when he did some office remodeling where I worked. The owner of the business and the plant manager commented that his work was excellent (and both of them are pretty demanding). Based on that experience I hired Lauren to build a shade structure at my house. He came up with a nice design that fit the space well. Meticulous selection of materials! Excellent construction! Ontime and a very fair price. That was probably 12 years ago; we repainted the structure last summer and it looks brand new. He just finished repairing a section of the siding on our house (the original contractor blew it and is long gone). Once again, proper selection of materials, excellent construction, good subcontractors, ontime and a fair price. When you find a good contractor, you stay with him (same with a mechanic or dentist). Laurens the best.

20060519 13:59:21 nbsp I saw funny, witty, etc. Lauren at our regular E  Street Cafe Roma yesterday morning.  My enthusiasm for the Davis Wiki got him to agree to be on it.  Im glad to help bring his quality craftsmanworkmanship to the attention of new people. Users/BruceHansen

20060704 18:23:40 nbsp I visited the website, the projects look great but the website was hard to use.  I will call about a small job I need done. Users/BarbaraClowers

20060831 00:30:03 nbsp Lauren had a look at my fence the other day.  I really liked that he thought my old tristakes were worth reusing but I was in the middle of a pool remodel and he didnt want anything to do with a drainage problem that involved the pool design.  Neither do I but Im stuck.  He wanted to do his own design and use his own people. Ok, so I have a small job in my granny flat.  That didnt excite him either because I already had a landscape designer. He did give me a name/number for a possible fence fixer.  He said check out my website, make a list like it says and get back to me. So tonight, I thought Id write that list and send him an email.  Nope. Website says communication is essential but no email.  Oh well.  Id like to work with him, but Im not sure I can fire all my helpers first and then convince him I want him to be creative and Ill let him design stuff that looks good on my website. I also like hourly billing and a fixed markup vs a bid with hidden costs and endless change orders.   BarbaraClowers

  Well it is often better to get a fixed bid because the contractor usually does not go over the bid amount.  The hidden costs are usually things like labor, small changes that people want to make but dont want to pay for.  I have had hourly labor and it kind of sucks.  You think that you are goning to pay a certian amount but then the charge is double.  Usually people who want to have everything itemized nit pick at every expense.  This can consume a lot of the contractors time.  khanh

20091215 18:14:47 nbsp Over the years Lauren has installed folding louver closet doors on 2 large closets (which still slide smoothly after many years) plus a lovely, sturdy fence, as well as solving a problem with my enormous skylight that no one else could figure out.  He is agreeable, efficient, professional, and works in a timely manner.  I would not hesitate to recommend Lauren.  Nice guy, too. Users/newyorker90

20100113 09:47:54 nbsp On time and on budget.  Exceptional attention to detail.  Listened closely and delivered on our needs and wants.  You can’t ask for more than that.  We met Lauren after we watched his work on a neighbor’s roof.  We’d met with several other designer / contractors around town and while all seemed competent, something just seemed missing; like we were just a job.  When we met Lauren, he asked thoughtful, detailed questions about what we needed and wanted. He focused on helping us create a vision and how he could fulfill our vision, not just on how to solve a construction puzzle.  He seemed most focused on getting us to visualize what a future home could be.  We lived in a little, flat roof Streng house in East Davis.  We came away from our meeting with gutlevel confidence that this was the contractor and designer we needed.

We added a second floor with a new master bedroom and bath.  We gutted much of the first floor, rebuilt the downstairs bathroom, built a new laundry area, rebuilt the kitchen, and modified the living room.  We replaced all the windows in the house and installed HVAC. One of our key criteria was that we didn’t want our house to look like a remodel.  We wanted cohesion inside and out so that you could walk up to, and in the house and take it as a complete, beautiful package rather than discover the parts that were new and notice the parts that were old.  Lauren created a design that is functional and fulfilled all our practical needs while also providing the aesthetics that make it beautiful and seamless.  It does not feel like old and new.  He also provided details that really shine such as a wonderful wood beam ceiling on the second floor, an exceptional vanity and soffit design in the master bathroom, a wonderful flow of space in the public kitchen / living room area, and the beautiful gabling in the front and rear roof lines.

We were adamant with Lauren that due to financial constraints and school schedules, we absolutely needed the project to be on time and on budget and that we needed a sincere, honest assessment and commitment.  Lauren strongly advised that we move of the house out given the size of the project, our budget, and time constraints.  We did so and are glad we did.  He delivered as promised.  We periodically came by to check the status.  Lauren was on site everyday throughout the day and even when the project neared the end and was on interior finishes, he still came by several times a day.  He cleaned the job site everyday, making sure it was a clean, safe, and efficient work environment for the next day.  We never saw the job site left a mess. Even his debris piles were orderly.

Lauren has a crew of guys that he’s worked with a long time.  His team of carpenters and subcontractors were excellent.  They were fast, detailed, conscientious, funny, and friendly.  We could tell that they cared about their craft and the outcome at all times.

Lauren has a dry sense of humor and a no nonsense way about him. We came to appreciate both his humor and straightforwardness. In closing, we absolutely recommend Lauren to anyone. He is outstanding and we have the proof.  We encourage anyone to contact us at dceppos@ccp.csus.edu to ask more questions or to drive by our home at 1102 Snyder Drive in Davis to see our home and compare it to some neighboring houses that remain the old footprint.

20100214 23:58:29 nbsp Lauren is an honest, trustworthy and commonsense contractor. He has a great eye for design but understands the reality of a budget. I was so happy with the job he did pitching the roof, adding central heat and air, and redoing the floors and a lot of electric work that a year later I had him back to gut and redo the old kitchen. The kitchen is really a testament to what can be done on a tight budget if the contractor listens, communicates, takes pride in his work and has great people working under him. I love my kitchen.

20100304 11:13:45 nbsp Lauren Vaage Construction rebuilt my roof to incorporate two flat areas and to provide more light for the family room. In conjunction with this he designed a skylight that is an attractive architectural feature and provides enough light to obviate the necessity of additional lighting during the day. His recommendations of roofing material and gutters made that part of my house far more attractive than before.

Lauren showed that determining and meeting the needs and expectations of his client was a very important part of the job. He is creative, knowledgeable, hardworking and environmentally aware. He worked well and cooperatively with his men and the subcontractors and paid attention to detail. The job was completed in a timely manner and the site was kept as neat and clean as possible.

Some months after the job was finished I indicated discomfort with one aspect of the family room. He responded quickly and resolved the matter to my satisfaction.

I wouldnt hesitate to recommend Lauren to friends.

20100325 22:10:07 nbsp 20103/25 We just had Lauren install new Milgard windows throughout our home.  We have used his services before and found him to be a master craftsman.  He obviously takes pride in his work as it is done with attention to detail and is built to last.  He goes beyond what most contractors do to ensure the job is done right and wont need repairs later.  You can count on him to be on time, on budget, and easy to work with.  He is definitely a man of his word and we would recommend him to anyone.  We have never had a better experience with any of the contractors we have worked with in over 20 years in our home.     Users/kdy

20100401 12:16:07 nbsp He sure enough do have a witty way with words, as if he were a character asettin on a porch way out in the country and whittlin just to pile up shavings. Users/dickliddle

20100517 17:03:48 nbsp Lauren is a brilliant designer and craftsperson.  He needed to have a repair done to our house, which required very substantial modifications to the front of the home. Working with a crew of reliable local artisans, he produced a beautiful, contemporary modification to our homeincluding a front landscape that is respectful of the history and landscape of the area, using native, lowwater plants and wonderful stones, all arranged to look as they have been here for centuries.

We trust Lauren completely, having known him now for a number of years. His artistry, genius, and attention to detail are evident in his work.

We hired Lauren after we saw the stunning work he performed at a friends house.  We have since asked Lauren to do more work for us, as we improve our home.

20100728 11:17:10 nbsp Lauren has worked on 2 of my houses in the past 10 years and has done an excellent job on both. The first house was a 1950s ranch style that had some work that needed to be done prior to my placing it on the market. Lauren was able to point out several problems that I hadnt been aware of and found practical and economical ways to correct them. More recently, the kitchen and den of my present home was getting darker by the year due to the growth of trees in the adjacent park. Lauren found an innovative, elegant and inexpensive way of brightening up both rooms. Laurens work is of the highest quality and he is neat, prompt and pleasant to be around. Users/kennethhenry

20101017 12:40:17 nbsp Five years ago Lauren undertook a major redesign and rebuilding of our early 1940s vintage home on Oak Avenue, between Russell and Eighth.  If youve gone down the street, youve noticed it.  It is visually stunning and wonderful to live in, and it respects the character of the neighborhood.  I highly recommend Lauren for the quality of his work and his commitment to producing an excellent product. Charlene Simmons Users/charlenesimmons

20101121 14:35:25 nbsp Lauren is a treasure and my mother and I have used him for many years now. He is a meticulous, honest craftsman, the kind of person to whom one can entrust ones home. He cares about doing the job right, the first time; once Lauren works on a problem, it stays solved. He looks at each situation with fresh and creative eyes, and he is very affordable. When he needs to bring in more people on a job, we like the people he hires, and, something that is important to us, they like and admire Lauren. Everything about his work and his manner is neat, precise, and orderly. He treats the job and people around him with caring respect. Soon, we are moving to Astoria, OR; I sure hope there is a Laurenclone up north!    Users/CeliaDavis

20110308 19:55:08 nbsp Lauren has done various work on our house over the last 18 years, and now we asked him to contract the work needed to prepare our house to comply with the City of Davis inspection. We are so glad Lauren took charge of the work, as he hired 7 different subcontractors who did outstanding work. It is a given that Lauren follows through, gets the work done on time, and  turns out an excellent product, but there is one part of dealing with him that we find so admirable. Lauren makes sure to get a good feel for the style of his clients. For example, a new part of a fence needed to be installed, and the old fence needed to be made more child proof. Lauren accomplished this without changing anything about our overall atmosphere in  the backyard.  I did not even ask how he would fix the problem, but when I saw his work, I could not have been more pleased. If you want a contractor who checks up on his subs, checks in with his clients, has an eye for beauty, and cleans up after he is finished, then hire Lauren Vaage everytime.  Oh, also he knows how to deal with the City inspectors, thank God. Users/PriscillaHawkins

20110622 21:14:08 nbsp I learned about Lauren Vaage through a neighbor, he was doing some kitchen repair work for her and I asked her about him.  My neighbor gave me a great report on the quality work.  She was very impressed all his work, trustworthiness and the ability to get the job done in a timely manner.  So, I called him for a window insertion job I wanted done and asked for an estimate.  I was very happy with his 12 window, sliding door replacement his project.  When I needed someone to repair some damage to the siding on my house I called him again.  He has completed three projects for me and I am impressed with the quality of his work and his flexibilityI am not the easiest guy to work for at times.  I have already told my neighbors about him and his accomplishments/work and they plan to use his services in the future.  As well, he is a local resident here in Davis and I wanted to keep the work here for Davis contractors, if possible.  I would call him again if I needed more work done. Users/richardlbernal

20110627 10:52:58 nbsp Lauren is professional, personable and creative. He successfully applied these attributes to a difficult repair/remodel on our home and did a beautiful job on time and on budget.  In particular
Lauren went the extra mile on his own initiative to insure the job was done perfect.  I give Lauren and his subcontractors my highest recommendation.   Users/BillHiatt

20110904 19:53:45 nbsp I hired Lauren for a large remodel in 1990, and have been using his services ever since.  Hes absolutely reliable, and a true craftsman and artist. You can also expect integrity and wisdom from Lauren when planning a project. Lauren has done multiple projects (big and small) for me over the past 21 years, and I have never been disappointed. Lauren is serious about his work, so dont let that dry sense of humor fool you. Hes the ultimate professional in his trade. Users/Teri Spiritosanto

20120528 12:56:13 nbsp All I can say is that I wish Id had Lauren build my house 33 years ago. I didnt, so needed someone good to darn near rebuild the thing after finding loads of dry rot. Finding Lauren was such a blessing!  He was so thoughtful, creative, and a real craftsman to boot. I got more than I paid for and cant recommend him highly enough. Having to have all the work done was a pain, and First Northern Bank was a bigger pain, but once Lauren got on it, it was pain free and actually enjoyable to watch such great work unfold.  I highly recommend him! Users/LynnSchimmel

20120702 21:00:15 nbsp Lauren recently remodeled our front yard. We got rid of our lawn and replaced it with a patio, arbor and drought resistant plants. Lauren designed an amazing plan for us, keeping in mind the priorities of our family. For example, we wanted the front yard to be a safe place for our young kids to play in. But we also wanted the area to be welcoming and in harmony with our neighborhood. Laurens plan did just that.

Lauren is very detailedoriented and handson. The people he works with (e.g. Felipe) are very professional and work well with him. Lauren uses very highquality material and works hard to keep within budget. Let me just tell you that working with Lauren was worth every penny we spent on this project.

Since we completed our front yard remodel, we have had numerous complements from neighbors, friends and even strangers. We have had people stop by our front yard to take pictures! We feel like celebrities thanks to Lauren. And thanks to Laurens honesty and professionalism, celebrities within our budget :) Users/EastDavisResident

20120817 14:27:33 nbsp Lauren designed and installed three open skylights in my dimly lit northfacing kitchen earlier this year. Once I saw Laurens proposal, no ordinary skylight would satisfy. His design added artistic interest and wonderful light, as well as made the kitchen feel more spacious. Lauren worked diligently and closely supervised a considerate, skilled crew for the roofing and drywall aspects. He took care and time to section off the area so that we were able to live at home and use the area afterhours without being overcome by dust. In the end, the improvement looks completely natural in our modest home, yet adds so much. We have Lauren to thank for transforming our kitchen with natural light and making it a much more pleasant room to hang out in. Users/SusanTrigilio

20140113 11:13:20 nbsp After interviewing other contractors to remodel my home, I took a friend’s recommendation to talk to Lauren Vaage. Having previous experience with restorations, renovations and remodels, I was looking for someone who could do serious and original design work as well as highquality construction. My home is a single storysprawling ranchstyle house with connecting rooms, and I wanted to open and free up space between the kitchen, living room and dining room. The master suite and guest suite were very awkward,with a dark shoehorned master bathroom that could only fit one person uncomfortably.Using Lauren to develop the designs and take the responsibility of construction every day proved to be a rewarding experience. At our first meeting, he listened to what I was trying to achieve, studied the structure, crawled in the attic and took photos in the crawlspace in order to let me know what the existing framework could accommodate. Lauren develops his drawings with all the aptitudes of an architect, and builds them very personally and with great detail, making suggestions and incorporating modifications quickly, without the backandforth of working with an outside firm. In my house, he identified and integrated unused attic and wall spaces to enlarge the house without increasing its footprint. The kitchen, which I thought could just use a couple of skylights, instead took light and space from a new clerestory. That radically transformed it and made it bright, roomy and comfortable, and also blended it with the living room and dining roomand enriched the exterior look of the house. You can see in the beforeandafter photos below how the bedrooms turned out too. Remodeling is expensive, you want to get every dollar’s worth, and that includes making sure you make use of every opportunity that your house presents: redoing walls means you have a chance to incorporate builtin shelves and niches, tiles allow you to play with your perspective, etc. In my case, upgrading from a conventional design only represented a marginal increase in costs, but an enormous increase in value, and working with Lauren I learned about real quality craftsmanship that will not require a callback. The best part is when you can have a truly effective function served with beauty, so that the space continues to surprise and nourish you.  Users/NicoleR



20140118 12:34:05 nbsp Is it any wonder  if Lauren ended up also redesigning the landscape around my house. But when he first approached me with his ideas for the yard, even though I had thoroughly enjoyed working with him on the house, I was very confident that as a gardener I could tackle this myself, and reluctant to hire the job out. He invited me to simply look at the idea that had been forming in his head and that he’d drawn out. Once again, I was struck by his boundless imagination and his bold artistry, along with his understanding of balance and context, which not only took every advantage of the space, but set the house in a completely new perspective. It was simply irresistible. He integrated my desire to eliminate the lawn, and grow lots of fruit trees and native perennials. Drawing from his recollection of the Davis of his childhood, with its grasslands and rivulets, he created a creek bed with a boardwalk access to the house. The land around the house looks completely natural and wild, my daughters explore it with endless enjoyment, scrambling over rocks and digging under logs as though we lived out in a regional park. Lauren designed a gutter system for the house to channel rainwater into handmade peat bogs to support marsh plants, with nooks and crannies so that frogs and lizards can be reintroduced to the area. He redefines the word “LAND scaping” and the results are not only visually stunning but also functional, comfortable, and, best of all, ecological and waterwise. Users/NicoleR
