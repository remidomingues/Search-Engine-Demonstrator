wiki:Vacaville:Vacaville is West of Davis on I 80.  It is about 12 miles further West than Dixon, 20 miles from Davis.  Vacaville has an estimated population of 96,725 as of 2005. It is comparatively larger than Woodland and Dixon; however, much smaller than the greater Sacramento area.  Locals (aka Vacavillians) call Vacaville many things: CowTown, The Ville, and The Deuce V. It is also often abbreviated as VV by locals (similar to neighboring cities Fairfield FF and Suisun City SS).  Because vaca is Spanish for cow and ville is Old French for village, a common wiki:wikipedia:folk etymology says that Vacaville literally means cowtown.  However, it is actually named after the original landowner, Juan Manuel Vaca, similar to Pennsylvania not meaning Forest of Pens, but rather named after William Penn.

Vacaville is home to two prisons: http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Visitors/fac_prison_CMF.html California Medical Facility (CMF, which is famous for housing Charles Manson for a short time) and http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/visitors/fac_prison_solano.html California State Prison, Solano. http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/98legacy/06251998.html Prison labor in Vacaville is used for making fineground optics. Psychology of Law classes used to take field trips to the prison in Vacaville. Students got the chance to speak with prisoners and tour the facilities.

It also has many things on the Davis Wish List. The http://www.premiumoutlets.com/outlets/store_listing.asp?id50 Vacaville Premium Outlets has many name brand stores that sell their overstock items at discounted prices.  Other stores within this shopping center, like The Gap, sell clothing/items exclusively made for their outlets.  The shopping center also has a Target, WalMart, and both a Sams Club and Costco.

Home of the band http://www.paparoach.com/ Papa Roach, or P. Roach if youre cool. Papa Roach was featured on http://www.mtv.com MTVs short lived show Coming Home, in which musical groups and bands went back to their hometown to show a film crew around and then perform a live show. Papa Roachs show featured a battle similar to that of the Epic Quad Battle Epic Quad.

Owing to the demographics of Vacavilles visitors, the place is something of a hitchhikers black hole.  If you find yourself trying to hitch out, be prepared for a very long wait.  Attempting to walk to Dixon is not a recommended alternative.



Outdoor Climbing climbing can be found in Vacaville at the Nut Tree Boulders. Vacaville Ice Sports has 2 ice rinks and is near to the 16 screen Brenden Theatres Vacaville Brenden Theatres.

Vacaville was once the home of The Wooz, a giant maze theme park of sorts.  Vacaville was also home to the Nut Tree, a general themepark of sorts for which the airport, parkway and road (see photo) are named after.  In 2005, it was announced by various media outlets (therefore, considered to be true) that the Nut Tree theme park would reopen.  This rumor has widely been accepted as true after many Vacaville natives noticed heavy construction on Nut Tree Parkway, Leisure Town Road and East Monte Vista Avenue near the Interstate 80 offramp.  Apparently, the City of Vacaville had no money to help out recent Alamo Creek flood victims, but finds the funds needed for future tourists to wear and tear along the avenues mentioned earlier.




Vacaville has recently made headlines for one of its mothers and sons, wiki:WikiPedia:Cindy_Sheehan Cindy and Casey Sheehan. Cindy started a vigil August 6, 2005 at President Bushs Crawford ranch to protest the Iraq war in which her son, Casey died.

20050606 01:39:30 nbsp Ive only seen a few hitchhikers, the most recent was waiting on an I80 onramp, but he was in a weird blind spot, I would have totally picked him up had I not almost hit him, plus the line of cars behind me sure wouldnt have appreciated me stopping. Isnt hitchhiking illegal in California anyways? Users/MichelleAccurso

   That may have been me.  Short, asian, glasses, likely with a black trenchcoat?  Im not all that good at the hitching, so if I was in a blind spot, Id like to know.  Also, no, its not illegal, as long as you stay off the freeways.  Ive given a lot of cops the thumbs up. ct

     Ha ha, no, this was some hippie white guy. Cute though, I would have picked him up, I was on my way to work, he would have fit in in Davis. Eh, bygones. Users/MichelleAccurso Michelle
      He can always tell the cops that he is just giving all the drivers a thumbs up Users/JesseSingh

20050606 08:20:31 nbsp Ive had to hitch hike out of Vacaville before. Took like 2 hours to find someone. Users/GiladGurantz
   Probably would have been quicker to walk.  Users/GeorgeLewis
     Yeah, but it was after a 22 mile bike trip through Winters then down to Vacaville, and I was too out of shape and tired to attempt any more physical effort Users/GiladGurantz
       Excuses, excuses. Users/GeorgeLewis

20050824 17:04:00 nbsp I dont agree that Mels is awesome.  Its as middling and watereddown as any other chain diner, but with some chrome and neon added in.  Nations Giant Hamburgers, however...now THATS awesome! Users/RickEle
  Youre so right, I liked Mels because my friends worked there, and hell its 24 hours. But now Ive discovered the wonders of 24 hour drive thrus in Davis, like Del Taco and Mels is a thing of the past. Users/MichelleAccurso

June 7, 2007: Does the population listed include prison population others that are institutionalized?

20100210 14:02:26 nbsp I dont believe the population includes prison inmates, but I could be wrong.

I live in Vacaville right now with my partner, a graduate student at UC Davis. Theres a lot of big box shopping here and typical restaurant chains. Theres not much good original dining to be had like in Davis. The tiny downtown is cute and has some good restaurants and shops, but most of the rest of Vacaville is somewhat run down. The northeast is probably the nicest residential part and the least run down. Its pretty much a typical sprawledout suburban area. The community is mostly working class and blue collar families, with some military from Travis AFB in Fairfield living on the west side. They live here because its safer with better schools than Fairfield but not much more expensive. Vacaville is a pretty boring if youre young and dont have kids.

We had a good reason to move here (its a long, boring, complicated story), but I wouldnt recommend a typical Davis student live in Vacaville just to save money. The housing is easier to rent and doesnt have the crazy competition (we had complexes calling us for months after our visit and begging us to rent) but isnt significantly cheaper. My partner and I are moving to Davis this summer, and weve done the math and found that, with the cost of gas, oncampus parking, and the water sewer trash bill we had to pay on top of rent my partner is only saving about $25 a month living out in Vacaville. Thats definitely not worth the hassle of a daily 2025 min drive. And were moving into a nicer and fancier apartment (although the same size as our current place in Vacaville) in Davis than what we have now. Had we picked something more modest my partner mightve saved money or broken even. If you really want to save money commuting youll be better off in a place like Woodland.

In summary, come here for the outlets and shopping, but dont live here unless you dont have other options! Users/bear
