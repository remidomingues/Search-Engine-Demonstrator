20080327 11:04:19 nbsp Dr. Farahyar is the family dentist for J Street Coop.  Everyone at J Street has had incredibly positive experiences with him.  Personally, I have been visiting him for semiannual checkups and cleanings for two years now.  I have never before visited such a kind, gentle, patient, and personable dentist.  I never feel like he is rushed or quickly moving onto the next patient.  His entire staff is very friendly, it is easy to make appointments, and I always look forward to visiting his office.  Plus, I have never had to pay a cent for my cleanings because they are completely covered by the standard dental plan that comes with my UC Davis student health insurance.  If you are looking for an awesome dentist, look no further! Users/ArianaBrill

20080401 23:00:27 nbsp I first started seeing Dr. Farahyar in 2003, after I asked around for recommendations.  He is the best dentist I have ever had (and I have seen many many dentists).  I have a lot of special dental needs that he effectively addresses.  He is competent, as well as gentle, kind, and generous.  If I ever leave Davis I might even make the trip back just for dental appointments.  I have enthusiastically recommended him without hesitation to many friends. Users/AlyssaNelson

20110406 22:14:55 nbsp This dentist was recommended to me by a coworker. I had a horrible expierence. First thing I noticed was the Dr standing in the hall way reaching around his back side itching in his rear. ( I mean deep) more than one time. Like a kid that didnt wipe correctly after using the bathroom!! When he came in to greet me I felt very uncomfortable!! He was looking at my legs and breast area! Like an old pervert. Then him and his assistant were having a conversation and the assistant kept laughing like a ditz! Was sexual tension in the air. Very uncomfortable. I give this dentist an F, dont ever go to this office. Especially if you are a female. Oh last thing is his prices are way to high. My friend that knows the Dr had some work done and he did not charge her for some of it and then gave her a good deal on the rest! I need similar work and the prices WOW!! ISNT THIS ILLEGAL???

20110426 23:46:22 nbsp I havent been to the dentist in like... a few years. Im not a fan of going to the dentist. But, Dr. Farahyars office was totally fine. I have no complaints. If I knew there was a dentist like him in town, I would have gone earlier.
I would highly suggest going here if you need a checkup/cleaning.  Users/LizS

20110512 12:44:51 nbsp Dr. Farahyar and Dr. Hung have been our family dentists since 1998 when they took over the practice from Dr. Jesse Ozier. Dr. Ozier had included the care of developmentally disabled clients at no charge as part of his practice. Dr. Farahyar and Dr. Hung continued this tradition of community involvment. In this time, Dr. Hung and Dr.Farahyar have seen us for semiannual cleanings and checkups and various dental procedures, including construction and placement of a full upper frontal bridge with implants. Their work has always been meticulous and first class. Their manner has always been caring with unlimited patience and a wonderful understanding of our concerns and needs. We have recommended their practice to family and friends without reservation, and continue to encourage others to see them for modern and professional dental care.     Users/AugieGarcia

20110513 23:29:11 nbsp I have been a patient of Dr. Farahyar for about two years now.  He has performed some fillings and removed my wisdom teeth. He is a great doctor. Each visit, he has been extremely professional, and his staff has been very nice to me.  I strongly recommend him! :) Users/davissaggiee

20110514 00:40:45 nbsp I live in San Jose and needed a tooth implant, and wanted a second opinion.  Dr Farahyar was highly recommended to me by friends living in Davis, so I came in for a checkup and he agreed that I needed the implant.  I had him do the implant and was very impressed how he took great pride in his work.  He and his staff are fantastic and I have continued to drive up here from San Jose for the last 4 years, and will continue to do so, just to have him work on my teeth. I also highly recommend him, and have recommended him to my friends Users/JackieLarsen

20110517 22:42:52 nbsp Highly recommend Dr. Farahyar and Dr. Hung. Awesome technicians and wonderful people. Very professional, exceptionally clean and wellmannered. Very patient and kind, and helpful to grad students re. insurance. Professional attitude AT ALL TIMES. Our family of four has a been treated by both dentists since they bought the practice from Dr. Osier 13 years ago.  Users/LyraHalprin

20120407 19:47:01 nbsp Whoever wrote the negative review under the name jonesgross is either being untruthfully malicious or has lost touch with reality. Dr. Farahyar is a kind, professional, and caring GENTLEMAN in addition to being the best dentist our family has ever had. Shame on you jonesgross!!!  Users/MarkVandeWater

20120929 23:13:02 nbsp Dr. Farahyar is a decent guy. I had a tooth pulled and he was very professional and courteous. His staff is very helpful, they know all about the UC SHIP insurance and if you dont have your card yet you can just use your SS#. Whatever that jonesgross person is talking about  I didnt see any of that. Thats just ridiculous. Anyway, I am new to Davis but I am going to keep seeing this dentist because I really like him and his staff.  Users/TJLanoue
