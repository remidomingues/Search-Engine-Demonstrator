Valero is a gas stations gas station. They take all forms of payment. They carry beer, including (as of August, 2013) Kona Longboard Island Lager.

Valero is based in San Antonio, TX.  As of September 8, 2010, they had spent $4 million in support of Proposition 23, which would suspend AB 32 until Californias unemployment rate drops to 5.5 percent or less for four consecutive quarters.  AB 32 (the Global Warming Solutions Act), passed in 2006 and signed by Arnold Schwarzenegger, requires California to develop regulations that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020.  Some people think that big Texas oil companies should stay out of Californias business.



Bread Truck Gas Theft
This station was robbed of about $8,000 in gas by people who rigged a bread truck with a large gasoline tank and a hole in the floorboard. The men attached a hose and sucked the fuel into the tank on multiple occasions. A man from Roseville was arrested. The owner likely wont report it to insurance because he says his rates will go up. http://davis.patch.com/articles/thousandsingasstolenusingriggedbreadtruckvideo/ Heres a story and some video.

It took a while to find someone to help, and then he just handed me a rag.  Didnt put an outoforder sign on it or even come look. Users/EdHenn

20070728 04:25:59 nbsp A few months ago, the Valero gas station at Mace Blvd started charging higher prices for customers who used credit cards versus cash payment. The price people are generally accustomed to looking at is the lowest price regular gasoline. Apparently this fooled many people and people were upset. The gas station shortly discontinued the practice of charging more for customers paying by credit card. The adjacent gas station, Spirit, did not charge extra and jumped at the opportunity and posted up signs stating that they do not charge extra for customers paying by credit card. Thus, Valero angered many customers helped their competitor. Users/JohnWong
