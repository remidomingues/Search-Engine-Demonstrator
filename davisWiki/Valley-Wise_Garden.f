The Ruth Risdon Storer Garden is a Valleywise garden, featuring flowering perennials and small shrubs that
are especially well suited to Central Valley gardens, including many Arboretum AllStars, recommended
plants for Valleywise gardens. It is designed for yearround color with low water use and low maintenance,
and features a demonstration planting of roses and companion plants. Educational exhibits highlight the
principles of sustainable gardening. The garden is named for Dr. Ruth Storer, Yolo Countyâ€™s
first pediatrician and an avid gardener. The ValleyWise Garden
is located just north east of the Arboretum gazebo.
