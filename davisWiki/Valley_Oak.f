Valley Oak is a hardy, droughttolerant species of oak native to Californias Central Valley. The leaves, while small, irregular and generally oakish in all ways, are larger than those of the Cork Trees Cork Oak (Quercus suber) or Coast Live Oak (Quercus agrifolia) and less spiny. The bark is dense and dark brown. Most Valley Oaks youll see in Davis sport Plant Gall galls of some sort, either on the leaves or on the branches.  The galls are harmless and are a historically accurate source of tannin for Society for Creative Anachronism recreating medieval ink and other uses.

Valley Oaks can be spotted standing alone in the middle of fields around Davis as well as scattered throughout the urban forest in parking lots, in front of schools, and in front and back yards.

The scientific name is Quercus lobata. Prompted by the trees significance to Central Valley ecology, California Aggie columnist Wolfgang Rougle occasionally uses the namesake Lobataland to refer to the Central Valley.
