Valley Oak Elementary is a schools school in East Davis on East 8th Street Eighth Street. It has many Valley Oak Elementary School/Murals murals that have been created over the years by generations of students. The presence of the school brings a stoplightcontrolled pedestrian crossing that is an annoyance to cyclists.  All vehicle operators would be wise to take an alternate route during times when school is commencing or letting out.

Quoting from the School Accountability Report Card, Valley Oak Elementary School opened as East Davis School in 1953 with 130 students. Our student enrollment has increased to about 650 students from ethnically, linguistically, and socioeconomically diverse backgrounds. The School Accountability Report Card is available from the DJUSD website, here: http://www.djusd.k12.ca.us/District/

Closure
On June 26, 2006, the Best Uses of Schools Advisory Task Force recommended the Board of Education to close down the school due to falling enrollment, particularly with the opening of Fred T. Korematsu Elementary School. On February 22, 2007 the Task Force officially voted 61 in favor of closing Valley Oak Elementary and will present its final recommendations to the School Board on March 1. Davis OPEN is a group dedicated to keeping neighborhood schools open in Davis.

Future

Today, the school is a combined campus containing DaVinci High School Da Vinci and a childrens center.  There was talk in 2007 of turning Valley Oak into a Valley Oak Charter School charter school.

  Apparently you didnt take any English courses while you were there. Users/JeffreyNonken
   I dont think Sean even went there, but you are correct, he doesnt know English at all. Users/JohnDudek
    I dont think Sean even went there. But you are correct, he doesnt know English at all. Users/RichRifkin
      Either way could be correct. The roofs are not THAT dangerous.  Users/ElisaHough
   The roof here isnt that dangerous, though it has great quantities of dust on the slick parts and moss on most of the shingled sections, given the pitch it is no more dangerous than any other roof to walk upon. ~Users/DavidPoole

20061231 23:11:51 nbsp This is the LAST elementary school that Davis should close. Users/ChebaccoThirty

20070101 14:12:08 nbsp Why is that? Users/ElisaHough

20070224 20:17:52 nbsp Why no mention of Dweezil being the worlds scariest school mascot? Users/KokoSorensen

20070225 11:40:56 nbsp Because you havent added any mention.  Who is Dweezil?  It would be neat if you could add some information about him to this entry. Users/JabberWokky
       Dweezil is the dragon mascot that can be seen in the photo above.  I dont think she is that scary, maybe just goofy and possibly annoying.  DagonJones

20070320 11:48:39 nbsp it is a shame that they build a new school in a wealthier whiter neighborhood and close down this wonderfull diverse school that has some of the best English Learner programs in the United states.  The school has also spent large sums of money on brand new renovations in the past few years.  It seems like a waste to close the school right after spending so much money Users/MattHh
  One of the first things you learn in economics is that is is irrational to make decisions based on sunk costs. The renovations have already been done and you cant get the money back. If the school is going to be a big problem to operate in the long run, it should be closed regardless of how much money was spent on it. That being said, I think its quite sad that yet another neighborhood school is being closed down. :(  Users/WilliamLewis
  Though your point about considering sunk costs is valid, I would like to point out that it doesnt take into account the costs of replacement. To build new when there exists old, what is the relative cost of upgrading this school vs. the cost of building a new school, as you made mention this is the long term. I wonder why it is that operating this school in the long term will cost more than the creation of a new school and its subsequent operation. I think there is some underlying issue with funding.. but not sure about that one. ~Users/DavidPoole

20070321 23:48:32 nbsp waahhh Theyre talking about shutting down MY elementary school! I remember Jason Aller playing chess in second grade, and when the school picked the dragon as its mascot (although I didnt think brown was a cool color)! Oh, well... Nothing is forever. :( Users/CentralDavisite

20071106 14:00:30 nbsp I am disappointed at the closing of this school because my niece attends there and she loves it.  She is an immigrant of two years and during this time I have seen her go from no english to conversational english. The location is very convinient for her, and Im not sure where shell go instead.

20080603 17:13:48 nbsp ok Dweezil the dragon stands in front of the school and hugs poor little children while singing at least once a week.  Its creepy.  lets just say that 90% of the kids that go there are afraid of him or hate him (or her, nobody knows for sure)! Users/smiley221

20080618 03:16:24 nbsp closing it? Lame Users/StevenDaubert

20080626 15:44:43 nbsp So basically this is the school that they chose to close because this is the poor area, right? Users/BrentLaabs

20080905 14:28:58 nbsp There goes the most interesting looking elementary school in Davis. Users/thelonepiper555

20100118 16:41:25 nbsp valley oak was my favorite school ever. and yeah, dweezil was wierd, but i just avoided her(it was a her) when she was hugging people. Users/katethegreat

20100118 16:44:26 nbsp i think it was just a stupid idea to build korematsu in the first place. the builders who promised it to the people who moved into that neighborhood were not thinking. Users/katethegreat

20101004 18:22:57 nbsp I only went to this elementary school for one year but I think it was a really good school and im sad they closed it. It really helped me get used to being new in town and make a bunch of friends.And I dont think Dweezel is weird at all, i know the woman who dressed up in the costume and shes actually very nice and not creepy or stalkerish.
