Across the creek from the Arboretum Headquarters, a line of large old Valley oaks towers over an open underplanting of toyon, California coffeeberry, elderberry, California hibiscus, redosier dogwood and others.  This makes up the Valley Oak Grove. Bigleaf maples grow along the path here and a planting of tule, rushes, and  arroyo willow at the edge of the creek provides teaching materials for classes studying learning about the traditional uses of native plants. A large California sycamore dominates the west end of the collection and at the east end, a planting of island mountain mahogany forms an understory for a grove of coast live oak.
