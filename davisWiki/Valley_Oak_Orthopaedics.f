Even a very specific question I needed to have answered regarding a medical procedure I was having was answered with Dont worry, the doctor knows what he is doing, instead of addressing my question. Dr. Barrys only advice was to exercise more  without even asking about my exercise history at all (before the injury, I was walking several miles per day and biking, etc).  If you are looking for someone to talk to you like youre a seven year old, then see Dr. Barry. If youre looking for actual medical advice, dont bother. Users/TRex
