Variety Donuts served doughnuts and doughnut holes.  They also supplied the UC Davis Coffee House with donuts.  It was replaced by another donut shop called Pink Dozen.

20080816 13:32:33 nbsp I am stressing out this weekend to finish a huge project and around lunchtime Sat. I started craving donuts (fuel of writers everywhere...) I decided to go to Variety Donuts, not realizing they close at 12:30 on the weekends. Not only did they let me in the door after they were technically shut (turning the donut case lights back on and everything), but after I realized I didnt have enough cash for donuts they gave me a half dozen for free, saying pay me next time. I will pay them back with interest: the donuts are delicious. I might get the project done now after all...  Users/PhoebeAyers

20090122 11:03:53 nbsp The folks who run this place are saints. My son and his friends stopped by before school once a week from 10th to 12 grade, until they graduated last summer. Anyone who can tolerate a bunch of teenage boys weekly gets my vote for excellent customer service! Users/NotSure

20091224 19:33:54 nbsp These doughnuts are great  much better than the ones at Fluffy Donuts, in my opinion.  The jelly doughnut is full of tasty jelly.  Crullers are very good, too.  And they will often throw in an extra doughnut or two if you are buying near closing time. But the main thing is how lucky Davis is to have local doughnut shops rather than big chains which are nowhere near as good.  Users/CovertProfessor
  Ive never seen a city of size without a local donut shop. Users/KellyM
   In California, yes.  In other states, for a town of ~65,000 people?  Very likely not.

20100526 17:33:17 nbsp apple fritters from here are amazing, all of the donuts are always solid (in a non literal sense) and the family that owns it is very nice Users/StevenDaubert
