The Varsity Facebook Team is for any of those select, obsessed, perverted people who have an obscene number of friends on Facebook. Membership in the team requires a minimum of 500 UC Davis friends (note the change from total friends). If you or anyone you know is in this select group, add their names to the list. This list was initially compiled from the http://ucdavis.facebook.com/group.php?gid2200601328 500 Club facebook group on 4/19/06.

20060419 21:00:16 nbsp So I just looked up Katie Webber on facebook because I was like who is this uber popular person Ive never heard of, and unless I am totally tripping, it says she has 582 friends.  Granted thats a lot, but thats half as many as shes listed here as having.  It doesnt include from other schools and I certainly didnt bother to tally up those numbers but I doubt that adds more than a hundred if that .... so whats the dealio? Users/KrisFricke

20060419 21:12:22 nbsp If you add up the not UCD friends, then that number alone is ~432 (I just did that really fast, but it shouldnt be too far off), and that places her with 1014 Facebook Friends. Users/MaxMikalonis

20060419 21:15:12 nbsp I started this page looking at peoples total number of friends. i figured that while its a little harder to figure out, its probably a more accurate way to measure how much of a facebook slut someone is (myself included). if you look at katies profile you can see that she has a ton of friends from other campuses. if you click on the link part of Katie has 582 UC Davis friends and then refresh the list to show all friends, it gives a handy little count of her friends from everywhere. when i first saw her name, i thought the same thing. how does this girl know everyone else but not me? i guess old guys like us are of no interest to upstart student focus freshmen girls like katie. sigh... Users/AdamGerber

20060419 21:15:17 nbsp Are you for reals?  theres only seven schools with more then ten.. shes really nickle and diming it up Users/KrisFricke

20060419 21:22:05 nbsp I doubt she specifically was trying to be on this page or anything, but yeah, Some people I just dont understand. Some of them, they have to have met the person to add them. Others are looser, and have their whole High School as friends. Users/MaxMikalonis

20060419 21:22:24 nbsp The question I supose is... Do she and Schwab know each other? :) Users/JosephBleckman

20060419 21:24:57 nbsp The answer is yes! She ran for Senate on Student Focus...... Users/KyleFlick

20060419 21:25:18 nbsp http://ucdavis.facebook.com/friends.php?search_querywebber&category_id8&id3208416 they do know each other! Users/AdamGerber

20060419 21:29:28 nbsp But around 1/2 way through the summer, James started adding every new Freshman on Fb, so in that respect, it doesnt count, but in terms of Kyle Flicks comment, they might. Users/MaxMikalonis

20060419 21:32:30 nbsp I think I remember that. I was kinda weirded out by it. Users/JosephBleckman

20060419 21:48:23 nbsp I usually dont add or approve random peeps... hence my normal friend count. Users/TusharRawat

20060419 21:51:47 nbsp yeah me, I get a friends request, and Im like yeah I know them, but do I know them that WELL? ...  pretty much the opposite of the friendwhoring types Users/KrisFricke
   20060419 22:03:21 nbsp kris, does that make you a friend prude? Users/AdamGerber

20060419 22:10:29 nbsp I only have 475 friends. I feel so very unpopular. Users/RobRoy
  The party king of davis party king, and 2006 City Council Election next mayor of davis has only 475 facebook friends? something about this lonley monarch seems strangely sad and a little Dickensian. i guess your just gonna have to settle with having more real friends while i have to promote my large number of imaginary friends.  Adam Gerber Adam
  http://ucdavis.facebook.com/friends.php?id3201803&category_id0 Your actually at 490, btw. so very close.  Adam Gerber Adam

20060420 00:51:47 nbsp I actually know two of these folks and have had multiple classes with them and yet are not friends with them on facebook.  I am awesome, or incredibly lame because of this. Users/BenWebber

20060420 11:03:13 nbsp I think these should be reverted to just UCD friends.  Hell, I could go back and add everyone from my highschool I ever talked to and double my number too. It doesnt really matter though.  I love James but when he runs into half of that list he doesnt recognize them I know its the same for the rest of the people listed here as well.  I tend to delete people when their profiles show up in the recently updated and I cant remember who they were.  However, Ive noticed that other schools, particularly Harvard and the Ivy Leagues, the numbers average much higher and dont seem to subscribe to my same facebook philosophy. Users/ThomasLloyd

20060422 21:44:52 nbsp I agree about that. Being overly popular in high school doesnt equal Davis relevancy. Users/JosephBleckman

20060423 01:21:47 nbsp Additionally, it is much easier to find people w/500+ Facebook UCD friends than 500+Facebook friends total. However, 500 is quite exclusive, but I guess that is the point. Users/MaxMikalonis

20060426 13:47:31 nbsp So, is there anyone who still wants to keep it at the total friend count? Users/JosephBleckman

20060426 16:42:20 nbsp i do. i think that having friends at schools other than ucdavis is still a good sign of how much of a facebook slut someone is. i guess we could switch it over, but i still feel like total friends is a better measurement. Users/AdamGerber

20060426 17:51:15 nbsp Friends at Davis is a really obvious number (its listed directly), while friends at other school needs to be added up by someone with a morbid interest in the subject; as long as we have data for the latter, we may as well list the former as well, and ohmygosh list it by BOTH systems... Users/KrisFricke

20060430 11:42:06 nbsp okay, so i changed it over for all of you. now its just uc davis friends. its alot of the same people as before but just a little less. sadly, im one of the few people who didnt make the cut :( Users/AdamGerber

20060822 08:13:47 nbsp Congrats to Rob Roy for making the list! Users/AndrewBianchi

20070224 14:31:31 nbsp I have 66 friends on facebook. About two in real life. Users/AliceChoe

20070312 18:37:45 nbsp This team isnt so 1337 anymore, the bar should be raised. Users/GregWebb

20070322 01:25:41 nbsp I think that people should only be counted if they actually know and/or have met their facebook friends.  There are a few people who added me as a facebook friend about 2 weeks after I got here Freshman year.  I do realize there is absolutely no way to enforce this.. it was just a passing thought. Users/KirstenOnell

20071011 22:21:12 nbsp As a member of this stupid team I really think it is ridiculous to tally up these popularity statistics. Users/AliceChoe has the best comment on this page. I have 857 facebook friends  how obscene. I dont know 90% of the people. There are no perks to being in this team. Why are good people wasting their time documenting a pointless popularity contest. Users/RobRoy

20071011 22:23:35 nbsp facebookers of the world unite! you have nothing to lose but your friends! delete your account! Users/JessicaRockwell

20071202 23:48:54 nbsp with all those names, I wouldnt call us a team at all P Users/EricFriedman

20080214 10:58:25 nbsp Ive been at UCD for over five years and Ive yet to get 200 friends.  I think the bar is high enough. Users/BrentLaabs
