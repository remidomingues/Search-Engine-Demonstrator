The Varsity Theater is the place to go in Davis to see art house, foreign and independent films that are often not shown at the other theaters in town. They have two screens: The larger theater seats 270; the smaller seats 97, with stadium seating. The Varsity has digital 3D projection capabilities.

Matinee prices are for all showings except the last two of the day (usually any show before 6:30 p.m.). Tuesday discount does not apply during the first two weeks of a films showing.

 News from the Varsity Theatre Newsletter 
This past Tuesday, October 16th, the Davis City Council unanimously approved a resolution to hire a consultant for the preparation of architectural plans to add a second screen to the Varsity Theatre. We propose to expand the Varsity Theatre to include a 300 seat Grand Theatre where the current 333 seat theatre is located, and a 100 seat Stadium Theatre in the current underutilized space at the back of the theatre. The Stadium Theatre will be accessible from the lobby via a Hallway Gallery where poster cases of past favorite Varsity films will be displayed along with local art. The only affect on the current theatre will be the requirement to move the side walls in approximately 6 ft (on one side at least). The cost of the screen will be financed primarily by the Citys Redevelopment Agency. According to city estimates, the cost of the improvements will be repaid in 1012 years. The city will own all of the improvements. The addition of a second screen will ensure that the Varsity Theatre will be a vibrant, wellmaintained, cultural and architectural icon of the city for many years to come. We hope to have the second screen in operation by September of 2008.

 Current Status 
The theater reopened for business on April 6, 2006 with the Mad Cow String Band performing, a documentary about the theater with interviews of employees going back to the 1940s narrated by Bob Dunning, and a screening of the film, http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0427944/ Thank You For Smoking. Attendance of the event was a regular whos who of Davis luminaries, from educators and entrepreneurs to politicos and the press.

In addition to a total redecoration including a new screen, sound system, seats and concession stand, a brand new (opened July 24) gelato/ice cream/cappuccino cafe called Icekrimski Cafe will be located in the small former office space on the left of the building. This cafe will also be accessible from the theater lobby.  The new seats are said to be VERY comfortable, and the arms in the new seats at the back of the theater (in the platform area) move up and form love seats.  Users/JonFenske Jon Fenske has commented that he figured that is where the cuddlers would like to sit anyway.

In the lobby are photos of 4 art deco paintings that were prominent in the theater. The only thing noticeably left to do in the remodel is the recreation of these paintings on the walls of the theater, on top of the 4 big yellow acoustic panels.

The new Varsity will function primarily as an art house cinema, showing firstrun independent films.



 Concession Prices 

TShirts are now available and they cost only $10!

 Architecture 
The Varsity is a late example of what is known as http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streamline_Moderne Streamline Moderne, a style related to Art Deco, which was influenced by 20th century manufacturing techniques. Moderne buildings were designed with an emphasis on smooth curves and horizontal lines to give a feeling of speed. Various moderne features are apparent in the Varsitys facade. The overhang angles out from the left hand side and is embellished at night with horizontal lines of red neon. Below this, the front wall of the theater angles backwards to mirror the overhang before curving smoothly around to meet the extremity of the righthand wall. The horizontal line formed by the top of the doors is continued by the chrome trim on the roof of the curved box office. On the roof, the tower at the right features alternating horizontal bands of red and blue neon.

 History 
The Varsity Theater was built by a local company in 1949 for the Westside Valley Theater Company. The Architect was William B. David, who designed many Streamline Moderne style cinemas in northern California, including the Tower in Sacramento. The 703 seat Varsity opened June 9th 1950, with http://imdb.com/title/tt0042426/ The Eagle and the Hawk starring John Payne. It was the first building in Davis to have air conditioning.  See a http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/tf896nb426/?&brandoac 1951 photo of the Varsity from the Eastmans Originals Collection Eastman Collection.

In 1976 Westside Valley Theaters split the cinema down the middle and installed two smaller screens, allowing them more flexibility with schedules. The Varsity was eventually taken over by Signature Theaters. In the late eighties Signature got permission from the city council to build two new multiscreen cinemas. In 1990, the Varsity showed its last movies (ironically titled: Taking Care of Business and Flatliners). To save the building from being demolished, the city started leasing it from Signature and turned it into a performing arts space. It underwent another renovation, gaining a stage and losing its snack bar and roughly half its seats. It reopened as a community theater on October 10th 1992.

It continued as a community theater for 14 years, during which time the City Council bought the building. However, despite Davis Musical Theatre Co. Davis Musical Theater Company producing around ten musicals per year in the theater, it was frequently dark, and the City Council resolved to find a way for it to be in use every night of the week. On October 25th 2005, the City Council agreed to lease the building to Jon Fenske and Sinisa Novakovic, who will run the Varsity primarily as an art house cinema.

20051202 10:40:17 nbsp The Varsity is also rumored to be haunted, and i would not be surprised if it was Users/JulienBiewerElstob

20060225 11:15:40 nbsp Yeah, there was a lot of unexplained stuff that happened when I worked there (music turning on when I was the only person in the theatre, footsteps, lights turning on/off). Users/KarleeFinch

Regarding ghosts...OK, Im starting to take this stuff seriously. I keep telling myself it is an old building with lots of dark corners and air vents.  But, Ive heard some strange noises, mainly creaky footsteps from the projection room when the lights are turned off. Users/JonFenske

   I hope not...

I for one am totally excited about the two new films coming to the Varsity Theater. Check out the trailers, and you will feel the same. Andy Jones

20060501 06:29:22 nbsp I really like The Varsityit looks great, really nice people work there, etc. Its always good to have less mainstream movie choices! My only complaint is that the arms dont move in the theatres! note: some do, entry updated  Users/JabberWokky jw The seats are very comfortable but the option to move the arms would be nice. I swear Davis movie theatres are anticuddling at the movies. Oh well. Having nonmoving arms on the seats are probably better anywayless shenanigans! P   ps. See TYFS before its gone! Users/KarlaFung

    Hi Karla,  Actually the new seats in the back (in the platform area) have arms that lift up and form love seats. I thought the back of the theatre is where most of the cuddlers would sit anyway :)  Users/JonFenske

        Thats where I sat too! However, they didnt move. Maybe I should have tried harder? But I tend to break things when I do. ( But good to know for future reference! Plus I think its cool that youre actively on the Wiki to update personally. Good job!  Users/KarlaFung

            Yeah, I think you have to give the arm rests a good tug.  I really dig the Wiki!  Its fun to keep people up on whats going on.

20060502 09:47:25 nbsp Jon, may I make a suggestion. Get an old fashioned pinball machine for the lobby of the theatre. Users/RobRoy

20060503 21:49:43 nbsp Erin and I went to the 7PM showing of Thank You For Smoking tonight.  The pricing was reasonable, the staff were friendly and capable, the seats were very comfy, and the screen & sound quality were good.  Oh yeah, and the movie was good.  :)   I like that they sell Martinellis sparkling apple juice at the concession stand.  ($2.50 is a bit steep, but at least they had options besides soda.)  Erin, the nutrition grad student, commented approvingly that the popcorn selection includes sizes appropriate to what a healthy person might eat.  The absolute best thing, in my opinion, was that the movie actually started when they said itd start, not 20 minutes later after youve been bombarded with commercials and condescending lectures about piracy.  So, Jon and Sinisa:  please keep it up!   Im looking forward to feeding my mocha monster when the minicafe opens. Users/GrahamFreeman

20060503 22:49:41 nbsp What I think would make this theatre great is if they switched the movies more frequently and played older films as well as new releases. Something similar to the Red Vic movie theatre in San Francisco would be amazing. Of course I dont know the logistics of operating a theatre so I dont know how feasible operating it that way would be. Users/EyadDarras

20060503 23:56:31 nbsp Hi Rob, I love the pinball machine idea!  But the only place we could put it is where the lobby will access the gelato/capuccino cafe next door (in a month or so).

Graham, thanks for appreciating promptness. It was a conscious decision Sinisa made. As for premovie ambience,  we now have background music provided by Davis connected musicians, courtesy of Mike Leahy at KDVS.

20060519 23:06:41 nbsp Hey Jon.  My wife and I went to see Art School Confidential tonight.  Great movie and great theater.  Its a beautiful place.  Best of luck with everything.  Now, if you only could serve beer . . . Users/AdamSchneider

20060613 13:36:28 nbsp I miss the drinking fountain that used to be in the lobby between the bathrooms; it had the coldest water ever. Plus I wanted to add water to my cup after the small amount of soda (compared to the ice) had been drunk. Seats: the one I sat in (which used to be row K I think) was definitely not screwed in all the way, it needs a quick fix with a drill. Users/NoelBruening

20060613 15:39:15 nbsp Noel, if you have any requests in future, dont be afraid to ask the staff! We would have been happy to top off your cup with cold water. Likewise, if youd mentioned the seat to us wed have fixed it immediately. Users/LiamCreighton

20060613 16:52:37 nbsp Thanks Noel. Ill be sure to have the seats around row K looked at.  Regarding the drinking fountain, I believe the city had it removed.  As for ice in soft drinks, the staff is instructed to fill cups the standard amount with ice, but also to honor all requests for more/less/or no ice.   Users/JonFenske

20060621 06:21:26 nbsp There are ghosts in the Varsity?  Cool.  Must be my son, who was managing the building when he died suddenly in 1999.  Nice to know hes still watching over the place. Users/BevSykes

20060805 11:20:10 nbsp Went in to watch An Inconvenient Truth the other day.  Cool spot, good ice cream.  I was happy.  Now do beer and wine! Users/JeffSpeckles

20060829 16:09:20 nbsp Saw Who Killed the Electric Car?. I was prepared for some kind of boring documentary and was pleasantly surprised. The film uses the case of Electric Car to provide a detailed examination of the politics of Californias groundbreaking initiative in the 70s and 80s, to move to a future of Zero Emission Vehicles. The automakers and oil companies paid lip service to the notion of an emissionfree future until it looked like it might actually happen. Then the long knives came out... Definitely worth seeing.

20061022 03:33:00 nbsp what about The Devil and Daniel Johnston? Users/YooHyunOak

20061022 12:53:00 nbsp Ive enjoyed seeing several movies here (Thank You For Smoking, Inconvenient Truth, Strangers With Candy).  The seats are comfy, staff is nice and price for admission and snacks is very reasonable (and the bathrooms are clean!!).  I also love that a locally owned theatre is showing some of the smaller movies I would have to drive elsewhere to see.  I do however have a few quibbles that I felt must be expressed and they have to do with picture and sound quality.

First the brightness of the projection is too dim for the size of room.  I suspect the brightness has been turned down to extend bulb life (a common practice amongst many smaller theatres as bulbs are very expensive).  At the corner edges of the screen it is very noticable and can be distracting at times.  The other issue is the sound has a hollow echo in the theatre.  Baffles can be installed to minimize this but admittedly it would affect the overall pleasantness of the architecture (and are obviously expensive).

I will however continue going to the Varsity but I just felt these issues must be said.  Im probably more nitpicky than most but I think the average theatre going person has had their expectations lessened by large chain theatres whose general lack of standards has worsened over time as few people voice their concerns to management.  I just think that a good experience can be a great experience. Users/HollywoOd
  I didnt notice a brightness problem last time I wend. Also, just so you know, dimming a bulb does not extend its life. Roger Ebert has commented on this practice http://www.drafthouse.com/shared_web/dimbulb.html multiple times. Users/CraigBrozinsky

20061106 23:26:23 nbsp Why are you showing Little Miss Sunshine starting on the 10th?  Users/RyanPrendiville

20061107 15:13:47 nbsp Hi Hollywood, thanks for your comments.  First off, we are definitely not dimming our bulbs, and we spent well over $100,000 on acoustics and related equipment. The sheer size of the room may lend itself to a different experience than the muliplexes though.  Regarding projection, you are the first to mention this, but upon closer examination I did notice, when showing flat (vs scope) films, a very thin area at the borders that is not quite as bright.  We are having our tech person fix this.  It is an allignment/projection tuneup issue. Anyway, I appreciate you letting me kow your concerns.  We definitely want the theatre to be the best it can be. Users/JonFenske

20061107 15:31:34 nbsp Hi Ryan,  We are splitscreening Sunshine with the John Lennon film.  We initially booked Last King of Scotland for the weeks prior to the Christopher Guest film For Your Consideration (which is expected to be a big hit).  But the studio decided to pull back the release of Last King to time it with the Oscar season buzz.  We couldnt get any bigger films for such a small time space. Users/JonFenske

20061108 20:50:42 nbsp Thanks for the response, I just thought Little Miss Sunshine was quite well played already. But I guess this is good news for the indie crowd (even if we seem to have different views of what indie means). However, I think its quite possible for someone to go to Regal or any of the other large multiplexes and still understand the movie business. Showing the same product as a large multiplex does nothing to alleviate the need for a truly indie/independent theater, but I acknowledge that your hands are probably tied by distributors. Users/RyanPrendiville

20061221 17:03:40 nbsp Damn, I guess that means that the only way to show interstellia 2525 is by renting the whole place  Or maybe a film festival type thing. Eh, who cares. Can you ask Sinisa when I go on schedule? I havent heard from him a couple days ( Users/StevenDaubert

20070105 14:02:42 This is THE BEST theater in Davis.  Always amazing, fresh films that I wouldnt have had the chance to see in a mainstream theater.  When I first arrived in Davis I was pleased to see a good showing of theaters, but was a little disappointed by the Regals.  Theyre not bad, but theyre not pristine moviewatching environments either.  The Varsity, on the other hand, has a great atmosphere and pleasant employees who really seem to appreciate film.  All of my experiences there have been spectacular.  And I like that Jon uses the Wiki. Users/CaitlinMorrow

20070113 09:46:22 nbsp I went to see the Dixie Chicks doc Shut Up and Sing at the Varsity last night with my little sister.  She was visiting Davis, and being 16, is typically not impressed by anything.  However, she LOVED the Varsity, and I felt like it was a great way to introduce her to Davis. Users/JillWeinstein

20070512 10:27:47 nbsp The Lives of Others, a film set in 1980s East Germany (before the wall was taken down), is playing at the Varsity for the next two weeks.  I highly recommend it.  I do not exaggerate when I say that it is one of the best films ever made.  It won the an Oscar and a Golden Globe award for Best Foreign Language Film; it won Best Actor, Best Film, and Best Screenwriter at the European film awards; and many other awards.  If youve never been to the Varsity, this is a good time to go. Users/CovertProfessor

20070524 13:54:55 nbsp Do they use real butter on their popcorn? Users/Jedron

20070625 15:47:55 nbsp I worked at the Varsity Theatres (I & II as well as Cinema 2) for Sam DeMasi around 19871990. It was a great group of people to work with! Sam was a character as well. I think he and John (the former projectionist) are the ones stomping around the Varsity today. Nice to know that Sam is still around. Around 1991/92, I was working for City of Davis to help clean up and renovate the theatre. That was when they tore down the wall that separated the I & II. Phil Sequera and I probably knocked years off our lives breathing the dust and asbestos cleaning that place out. We were the first to see and uncover the art deco paintings (1940s style agricultural depictions) that the city destroyed in their renovations. I spoke with John Fenske about them as I was the one to take photographs of them before they were painted over. Unfortunately, I handed those negs over to Bob Bowen. Thankfully, John appears to have some of the prints and is working on having an artist recreate them. Rock on, John. Im glad someone in this city is interested in preserving Davis history. Users/DebWestergaard

20071023 22:56:59 nbsp Will you be showing Lars and the Real Girl at The Varsity?  Id love to see it, but its not showing at any theaters in the area. Users/KatieLeasure
  You can contact the theater directly through their website or by phone and perhaps suggest it.

20071024 13:51:15 nbsp My biggest complaint is that the Varsity doesnt book enough arthouse films. Far too many of the films that they show are also showing in large multiplexes. As an example, the most recent two films (Into the Wild and Darjeeling Limited) had widespread distribution, and were easy to find. I wish the Varsity would show more films that I cant see elsewhere. This would be easier if they would book more than one film at a time. I understand that they only have one screen at the moment, but that wouldnt prevent them from showing two films in a week. Id also love it if they could show some classic films, but thats a discussion for another time. Users/MattCzarnowski

20071026 13:48:52 nbsp I think the Varsity does a good job with its selection of films. For people without a car in Davis, its a pain to try and get to Sacramento to see a film like Into the Wild. The Varsity takes care of that problem, and serves the community well. :) Users/davistudent
but I am wondering why this is the 3rd or 4th week theyre playing Into the Wild and keep pushing back the Darjeeling Limited. COME ON!!!!!
 From the varsity newsletter: The Darjeeling Limited will almost certainly open on November 16.

20071109 21:19:51 nbsp I echo the last comments, overall good selections, a little more artsy and rare wouldnt hurt  but I guess a second screen would definitely help with that. To the crux of my message: could you/ have you considered playing Bella?? Looks like a great movie with various awards under her belt. Users/AntoniaTsobanoudis

20071111 00:22:09 nbsp I understand that cost and the current 1 screen are issues, but here are some suggestions for my idealized version of the theatre:
a) What everyone has said: Would be lovely if varsity could screen more art/independent films at one time, both the oldies and the newer ones. Perhaps the oldies could be screened during the earlier portion of the week (I am assuming ThurSun generates the most profit)?
b) Hopefully there are more midnight movie series to come.
c) Would be great if special screenings could be held on/during holidays&other memorable dates. Example: Rocky Horror around Halloween, cult movies around their anniversaries...

Oh, and Tuesday special rate is excellent. Users/il
  People dont come to art and independent films, and cult films have almost zero attendance.  People talk about them quite a bit, and how cool it would be.  When they are run, people talk about how great it is that they are running.  The theater then fills with two or three people, sometimes even approaching a dozen.  Or sometimes simply zero.  The projectionist then breaks down the film and goes home.  It is quite sad.   Users/JabberWokky
 Are you referring to Davis in particular? This sure hasnt been the case in the other college towns Ive lived in. In terms of Davis, Im not sure that anyone really knows the current demand for independent and cult films in this town, since to my knowledge they havent been run on a regular basis. Part of building an audience is regularity and reputation. If people know that indie cinema/event movies routinely occur at the Varsity, it would help increase public knowledge of them, and encourage attendance. It definitely might be be rough going at first, when the community isnt aware of whats going on and what the future plans are, but it could build over time. If it is true that showing some classic films and cult films wouldnt attract enough people in Davis (couldnt one schedule programming in conjunction with the film studies program?) thats really sad.Users/MattCzarnowski
  ...my idealized version of the theatre.
 That said, I feel that the theatre could be better utilized given it had the means, whatever that might be without losing business. Of course, I dont know anything about running a theatre and I am sure the Varisty is trying to maximize its potential, but it seems to me that running the same movie over several weeks may not attract as many people as say, running two movies over several weeks (again, how that would run in practice, I do not know).
 For the special screenings idea: I agree that it would be suicidal for the theatre to run too many cult movies at this stage, but I have a feeling a couple well planned screenings throughout the year might work outthe screenings would need to generate enough interest& well publicized, perhaps through working with local businesses to create some type of theme  (easiest example: the annual beat generation conference, although I think the theatre is already doing this).  Users/il

20071111 21:39:05 nbsp Thank you for the interesting discussion on this board! Im sorry Ive been away for a while. A couple of comments:
1. We dont have total power over our programming.  If a film does well over a weekend, it is very difficult to take it off and move on to the next booked film without generating future difficulties with studios. Into the Wild (a very good film as a note) has far, far exceeded everyones expectations. In fact this weekend, the box office has been up at many venues in Nor Cal  again against all expectations.  So what can we do.  We very much have planned and wanted to show Darjeeling for 2 weeks now. We will try our best to get it up on Friday Nov 16. As a note, the studio has distributed hundreds of free passes to see Into the Wild around town and UCD (we still get reimbursed for the admission). I understand there were quite a few at Mishkas Cafe  on Sunday afternoon.
2. When we get the second screen up, this will prevent delays (like with Darjeeling) from happening in the future  at least with bigger films...and help alleviate A LOT of frustrations.
3. We try to program a wide variety of intelligent/creative films...so there is something for everyone. The term art film can have different meanings to different people. If there is an audience for a film, it will be shown at many venues, including multiplexes. Generally if a film is critically acclaimed (even small tormented films like Half Nelson etc.) it will find an audience in NY/LA and eventually the smaller markets.
4. As for other programming (Midnight movies etc), Ill work on that next year.  If nothing else, Id like to have a Big Lebowski weekend : ). Were playing This is Spinal Tap on Dec. 2 in conjunction with Watermelon Music.
So the future is very bright. Stay tuned! (from a coowner of the Varsity Theatre).
 Users/JonFenske

20071114 16:45:08 nbsp Thanks  for all the feedback, Jon. Its nice when owners get involved on the wiki. Thanks for playing Into the Wild and now the Darjeeling Limited :) Is there any chance of Lars and the Real Girl, or Im Not There? Users/davistudent

20071115 21:55:16 nbsp Lars and the Real Girl has been added to the possible list.  As a note, this decision was totally a result of requests from email newsletter subscribers (and on the wiki)...another advantage of having a locally owned and operated theatre : ). We have to wait and see if there is break between the firstrun films we hope to show.  Users/JonFenske

20071116 12:26:14 nbsp UPDATE
We have procured the Wes Anderson 13minute prequel to Darjeeling Limited   Hotel Chevalier.  The short film stars Natalie Portman and Jason Schwartzman and has gotten great reviews. We got this after show times were due for submittal this week, so we wont have it up on screen until Friday November 23. Users/JonFenske

20071125 18:04:16 nbsp Id like to voice my displeasure at going to see Darjeeling Limited last Sunday before the Varsity added The Hotel Chevalier. However, The Varsity should have been more explicit that part of the film, The Hotel Chevalier, was missing (at the time, they have it now). No other person I know who has seen the film went to a theatre that did not play The Hotel Chevalier in the beginning, and also no other theatre presented it as a separate film, but played it as the first part of the movie. (update) I did a bit of further research on this, and it looks like theaters were playing the film w/o Hotel Chevalier, but that was in October, before a bunch of moviegoers became upset and the studio had the two films screened together again. If one goes to the  http://hotelchevalier.com/ Hotel Chevalier website, it states that it will be played with Darjeeling. I get the feeling that having to play Darjeeling without Chevalier was forced upon the Varsity by the studio, but still Im not pleased that I,  and all the folks in the theater that Sunday missed out on something we could have reasonably expected would have been included with the movie. Users/MarieBoisvert

20071125 22:29:52 nbsp Thats unfortunate to hear that some people didnt get to see the Hotel Chevalier short. However, Darjeeling is not playing with Hotel Chevalier anywhere in the entire San Francisco Bay Area. Hotel Chevalier is not even playing in LA. In fact, if I wanted to see the Hotel Chevalier short, Id have travel back to Davis. Thats a little far for me. Users/Jedron

20071126 20:59:32 nbsp Marie (and all others who have seen Darjeeling Limited),
Please be our guest to see Hotel Chevalier free of charge at any time.  The movie will be playing through Dec. 5 (at least).  Just go to the theatre at a published show time and tell the manager that you saw Darjeeling prior to us adding the short film.  They are instructed to let you in to see Hotel Chevalier free of charge.  We couldnt add it to the first week because our show times were already submitted and we didnt allow enough time between showings to include the short film (which arrived later).
Thanks,

20071127 12:31:37 nbsp Hi Jon, thanks for youre continued participation in the Wiki! Its nice to know that some businesses like listening to their customers. I know that art/indie means different things to different people. Its not that I think the Varsity has picked bad films, just that they have had a tendency to run films that I could have gone to a mainstream theater to see. While I know you need to make the money to stay in business, I keep hoping that the Varsity will bring films to town that arent playing at almost every multiplex, even if those other films only play certain days of the week.(can you snag Crispin Glovers new film/slide show?)I remember going to all kinds of unusual films as an undergrad, and I wish students here could have that same experience. Davis could really use a more interesting nightlife/culture scene, and I guess Im looking at you to be part of it. No pressure or anything. ;) (btw, Ill gladly support your Big Lebowski Weekend. I volunteer to help staff the white russian counter.) Users/MattCzarnowski

20080203 22:25:13 nbsp Varsity should bring back Midnight Madness Movies!  I loved the ones they played last year. Users/CindyBanh

20080218 17:47:29 nbsp Hi Matt and other art film lovers,
We booked Persepolis last week. It is a black & white animated film, largely in French with subtitles, about a young girl comingofage amidst the Iranian revolution.  It is only playing at 2 screens in the Sac area.

20080329 19:04:13 nbsp Itd be nice if their website had a listing of stuff they previously played.  Since I work across the street, I constantly get people coming to me after theyve closed asking if I remember what played two weeks ago (usually cause they planned on seeing it, but didnt get a chance, but now cant remember the title).

20080731 16:31:39 nbsp Thank you for being here! Its wonderful to have a theater that brings substance to the cinema scene (not to mention foreign films)!  Users/everdrw

20081002 22:14:55 nbsp I went here for the first time last week to see Choke, and was really impressed with the experience. The theatre was big and  even CLEAN! Ill definitely be making visiting the Varsity a more common experience. :) Users/VanessaZ

20081107 18:00:46 nbsp They always have the cool film festivals when Im working :( Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20090311 11:40:18 nbsp Wow  I just found out Slumdog Millionaire will be playing for the second consecutive year.  Meanwhile, the coming attractions posted outside the theater have come & gone from OTHER theaters in the area.  I always loved Varsity but have had to visit other theaters  even having to go to WOODLAND to see new movies  consistently for a couple of months now.  Can Varsity really still be making $$ off this film?  Even if so, is there any importance in serving the community here & making some of the other options available without going to a large multiplex or leaving town?   Users/Dora5

20090805 12:55:10 nbsp Just saw Away We Go; the new digital projection system is great.  Are you still planning to add a second screen? Users/KatieLeasure

20091109 08:53:14 nbsp The landmark sign, ironically, makes Varsitys facade look less landmarkable; it juts into Varsitys overall aesthetic, gouging its continuity. The pole and placard has become an object of attention in itself, defeating its own function, namely, bringing attention to the theater. Its a good sentiment, mind you, but why couldnt they have put it off to the side and made it less conspicuous? Users/ZacharyNorwood ZN

20091222 11:10:15 nbsp An update, I (Jon Fenske) sold my half of the Varsity Theatre to coowner Sinisa Novakovic.  The sale was amicable and the future of the theatre is bright. As of midDecember, 2009, I gave up my responsibilities for programming.  Good night and good luck Varsity Theatre.  I wish you the best!     Users/JonFenske

20100224 16:28:54 nbsp Havent been to the Varsity in a while but get their newsletter it seems theyve quietly added the 2nd screen.  How is it?  Ive been afraid of the effect it might have on the main auditorium, has that been changed in any way?  Also anyone know if both screens are using digital projection and/or 35mm? Users/AlanSmithee

20100517 21:10:06 nbsp I grew up with the Varsity and I particularly remember those haunting, sepiatoned murals and how vast they were. I dont know who created the murals, but I am glad that they have at least been reproduced (the original murals contained asbestos so they couldnt be saved). How well I remember gazing in fascination at those rather melancholy and mysterious figures, trying to decide what their significance was. Funny the things that stick in your memory. I never heard anything about the Varsitys being haunted can an old building be haunted if there have never been any (reported) deaths inside it?

And kudos to Dave Rosenberg for having the wisdom to suggest an alternative to razing the theater. Its a beautiful building and it definitely adds a nice touch to Davis downtown and it has for 60 years. Users/MaryJamison

20110325 18:54:48 nbsp This theater sure doesnt like to promote what it has the main auditorium has had a digital projection system for some time now for a small operation thats pretty hightech. With the kind of movies they show it would have been wise to have kept the 35mm system, but thats been moved down to the new screen (its the same projector that was at the longgone Cinema 2 theater on E St, where Watermelon Music is now.)

I have mixed feelings about the added screen the area its in was the backstage area when this was a live theatre in the 90s and wasnt being used when they switched back to movies, so they had to do something with it. The intrusion on the main auditorium for this is a hallway that was sort of walledoff on the left side, so now the seats nearest the left wall have been displaced by a new wall sticking out the surround speakers have been remounted on this wall, and above that is a notch with the hallways ceiling and the remainder of the original wall. Still not nearly as awful as this theater was in the 70s and 80s, when it was cut into 2 by putting a wall straight down the middle.

The new screen is small but decent (I probably wouldnt want to pay full price to see a movie here.) Its commonwidth so the scope picture is small, but at least they dont insult you by raising the masking for the preshow ads like they do at the Stadium 5. The sound appears to be Dolby Digital judging from the sound reader I saw through the window but dont quote me on that. They used DTS (also inherited from the Cinema 2) when this projector was in the main booth, which was unreliable since many films didnt ship with the required discs (a problem this format has had since its inception), and smaller films only used Dolby Digital anyways.

20110804 17:06:46 nbsp I remember midnight showings of Rocky Horror back in the late 80s, it was awesome... people coming in costume, acting (speaking, singing) with the movie... and someone hit me with a piece of balled up toast that was so damn hard, I had a lump on my head for days.  All great memories (except the toast, or rock, or whatever the heck it was)... that movie should have never come out on video (cue old person grumbling). Users/OldDavis73
