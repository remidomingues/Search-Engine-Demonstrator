20090513 09:28:04 nbsp Hi.  I think you shouldnt be so concerned about a negative reaction to http://daviswiki.org/Marijuana?actiondiff&version266&version165 your comments.  In fact, I think you would find people here very receptive and interested in the perspective you have to share.  Welcome to the wiki, and hopefully well get to hear more from you!

20090513 10:39:49 nbsp Your experiences with Wikipedia have no more relationship to here than your experiences at McDonalds.  Welcome to the Wiki/Wiki Enthusiast This isnt Wikipedia, and we celebrate points of view and a myriad of perspectives.  In fact, most wikis are nothing like Wikipedia, and Davis Wiki, doubly so.  Let your freak flag fly, give your neighbor the elbow room to do the same (i.e., let them have their voice, too) and welcome to the wiki!  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
