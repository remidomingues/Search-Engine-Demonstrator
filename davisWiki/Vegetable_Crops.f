Processing Tomatoes dominate the Yolo County vegetable crops scene.  The type of Tomatoes tomato that we most commonly see in our grocery stores, the socalled square tomato, was first developed in Davis as a means to save the local tomato industry.  Alfalfa is another widespread vegetable grown in our region.

There is currently a branch of the UC Davis Cooperative Extension called the http://ceyolo.ucdavis.edu/Vegetable_Crops/ Vegetable Crops Program.  It seeks to research agricultural methodologies and advise local growers.

Vegetable Crops & Weed Science was a former department in the UCD College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences.  It was merged into the Department of Plant Sciences in 2004.
