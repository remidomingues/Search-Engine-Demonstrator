Davis reputation as a vegetarian, liberal, Birkenstockwearing kind of town is not really too far off base.  Davis Restaurants restaurant scene does, for the most part, an admirable job in catering to veggie customers. There is, however, always much room for improvement.

 Food Strategies 
  wiki:WikiPedia:Tofu Tofu is usually a meat option at most Chinese food Chinese restaurants and Thai restaurants. wiki:WikiPedia:Tempeh Tempeh (fermented soy) and Seitan/gluten (wheat protein) have also been spotted.
  Eggplant and portobello mushrooms are becoming popular sandwich items at Upscale Restaurants.
  At any Restaurants restaurant, its best to just ask about what ingredients are used, especially when it comes to soup bases, refried beans, and tortillas.
  Even if there appears to be nothing on the menu that is vegetarian at any given Restaurants restaurant, they are occasionally willing to make something especially for you (after all, you are special).
  Always use Nutritional Yeast, an excellent source of Bcomplex and sexy taste.

 Vegetarian Reviews 
 Americana 
  Both the House Special and the Cheese Pesto Sandwich are amazing at Delta of Venus
    Delta of Venus is very friendly  vegetarian options outweigh the few seafood options that they serve.  Everything there is really good. Make sure to say hi to Users/SharonZimmerman if shes working :)
    Delta of Venuss entire menu is vegetarian, save for 2 sandwiches, 1 salad, and part of the Caribbean menu. Its probably the most vegetarianoriented Restaurants restaurant in all of Davis.
  John Natsoulas Gallery Caf√© has vegan potato knishes, vegetarian spinachfeta cheese knishes, and some delicious glutenfree and spelt bakery items.
  Farmers Kitchen Cafe has vegetarian and vegan entrees, sandwiches, soups and desserts. Ask for vegan sandwich bread.
  Plutos Salads / Spuds  (even their small salad is big enough for a meal). Plutos has good food, but they are a bit expensive.
     I dont think Plutos is expensive at all. The large size salad, with 7 veggie toppings, is only $5.90. Users/AprilAries
     Sides at Plutos are only $2, two of them are enough for a hearty meal, but even one is a great size, ask for a piece of bread on the side! Users/kmassoudi
  Burgers and Brew The Garden Burger is excellent preferred it over the Portobello burger. It comes with good fries or mixed greens with an interesting balsamic vinegar. Theres also a Smoked Tofu Burger on the menu. The main drawbacks are its often really crowded and therefore service can be slow. Even ToGo orders can take 30 minutes!
   The tofu burger can also be ordered at Crepeville
  The Melt  Most of their menu items are vegetarian by default.
  UC Davis Dining Commons  All items on their menu are marked blue for vegan and red for vegetarian. Cuarto Dining Commons also has an exceptional salad bar and lots of fun vegan and vegetarian options. The Dining Commons also offer vegan Coconut Bliss ice cream on request. If you dont see it in the ice cream freezer, then ask an employee for some. All Dining Commons also offer a vegan corner, complete with nutritional yeast, an organic seed mixture and lots of veganfriendly dips and spreads!

 Doing Vegetarian at MeatOriented (Americanstyle) Restaurants 
  InNOut Veggie Burger (vegetables on a bun), Grilled Cheese or Animal Style Grilled Cheese.  Also, animal style fries is practically a whole meal.  Its not on the menu so InNOut Secret Menu ask for it by name.
  Redrum Burger  Veggie burger, and potato and veggie side dishes.  They also have a mushroom burger
    Does Redrum have a cooking surface for solely vegetarian food?  Otherwise one runs the risk of getting their vegetarian goods effectively sauteed in animal fat.
     as for this, Im not sure but being rather familiar with some people that work there...my guess is that theyre not super vegetarian conscious.  Users/KristenBirdsall

     I have heard from past employees that the veggie food is acutally prepared in the same oil/area as the meat food.    Users/TiffanySnell
  Wendys (closed) you can get a $0.99 baked potato with sour cream and chives, they also have a potato with cheese and broccoli that is a little more expensive.
  Cattlemens in Dixon has a kick ass vegetarian Ravioli dish, and while it runs pretty expensive, its still cheaper than all the meat dishes and a great option if youre stuck with friends who insist on eating at a steak house.

 Chinese 
  Davis Noodle City has a vegetarian section on their menu, dedicated to purely vegetarian dishes. You can discuss vegetarian options with them, theyre very open. They, along with Ding How, are the only two Davis restaurants that serve vegetarian wonton soup.
  Ding How allows most any dish to be ordered in a vegetarian option, and most people say they taste great too. I just ate here for the first time tonight and wow, I have no idea why I waited so long!  They have an ENTIRE vegetarian menu if you ask, and the mock meats look, feel, and taste incredibly close to the real thing.  Very reasonable prices and fantastic service to boot!  Users/TylerFelix
  Golden Sun has a very large vegetarian section on its menu, including both regular dishes (e.g., tofu and veggies) as well as mock meat dishes.
  Hometown Chinese Food has custom cooked food is available using fresh veggies and no MSG.
  Old Teahouse has a good tofu something (it is on the back side of the menu).  Their fried soy sauce noodles (thats not the name on the menu, but it is close to that) are really, really good too.
    Be careful at Old Teahouse. I ordered the tofu dish & found bits of greasy meat at the bottom of the container. Users/AprilAries
  Orange Hut (closed) has a pretty good chinese eggplant and tofu dish, but the porous and absorbent properties of eggplant make it rather oily.
  Wok n Roll is closed.  Wok n Roll had a tofu and vegetable plate with rice that is fairly cheap and decently good; mind you, its not fantastic but its definitely good for the price.  Departed business
 The Dumpling House offers vegetarian Chinese dumplings and wontons and a few vegetarian appetizers.
 Crepes / French 
  Crepeville  from makeyourown crepes (mushrooms, spinach, tomato), to dessert crepes. Try a side of potatoes (tell them not to burn it as it they usually over cook them) or smoked tofu.
   They also have a great sandwich option (I forgot its name!) with cheese and eggplant I believe youre thinking about the #3 bagel, with feta cheese and grilled eggplant Users/CalamityJanie

 Ethiopian 
  Queen of Sheba (closed)  Vegan/Vegetarian lunch buffet and many great tasting vegetarian options available throughout the rest of the day.

 Greek 
  Symposium The overall menu isnt all that vegetarianfriendly but it has what I think is the absolute best pizza in Davis. I always get the Spankotiropizza made with spinach, feta (and two other kinds of) cheese and garlic plus I have them add black olives on top. Theyve also recently added an appetizer that I like Kafteri Feta dip. This is made with feta cheese, olive oil and spicy roasted red peppers. Its a bit salty from the feta but very good. It comes with some bread, and also is good to dip your pizza crust in. This is a sitdown restaurant with waiters. I actually prefer to get my pizza to go. The pizza is a little more expensive than others in Davis but it is completely worth it.

 Grocery Stores 
  The Coop, Whole Foods, and Nugget are really good for vegetarian and vegan shopping. International Food Market is a good, cheap source for Indian vegetarian foods. They have items that Safeway couldnt even try to fit into their newly added natural food section.

 Indian 
About 40 percent of Indians are vegetarians. Traditionally, much of their food is lactovegetarian.
  Kathmandu Kitchen might be the best vegetarian food in Davis, take that advice or leave it.  Its completely vegetarianfriendly and if you go to the buffet you will never leave unsatisfied.
  Raja Indian Cuisine has many vegetarian dishes, notably ones made with fried wiki:WikiPedia:Paneer paneer (cheese) cubes.  Their lunch buffet always has plenty of options for vegetarians.
  Namaste Nepal Restaurant has several vegetarian dishes, and there seem to be lots of vegetarian options at their lunch buffet as well.

 Italian 
  Paesanos has a considerable vegetarian selection. Just be careful about parmesan cheese, which contains animal rennet, and is not always listed on the menu item descriptions.
  Rostini Italian Kitchen has many vegetarian dishes, including salads, pizzas, pastas, and a sandwich.  Also, they deliver!

 Japanese/Sushi 
  Jusco Sushi on G street next to G Street Pub has many vegetarian options for your favorite rolls. If you mention that youre vegetarian to your server, they offer tons of dishes not even on the menu.  Ive even gotten free ice cream.  The vegetarian Dragon Rolls and Salt and Pepper Tofu are fantastic.  All you can eat.
  Moshi Moshi has a nice selection of vegetarian sushi and other dishes. They are also willing to leave out the meat ingredients in the special entrees if you request it.
  Sushi Unlimited offers a few vegetarian sushi options (as well as two on their halfoff menu). They can also serve vegetarian udon!

 Korean 
  Manna has a couple of vegetarian options; not a lot of them on the menu though.
    Make sure you ask if the curry has fish sauce in it.  Fish sauce is usually included in most curries unless you ask for it not to be (most every dish can accommodate this)
  Tako Korean BBQ Tacos has several vegetarian options including burritos, tacos, and rice bowls that can be filled with marinated tofu, shitake mushrooms, and/or veggies.

 Mediterranean 
  Ali Baba has a really good Vegetarian Special. They have a variety of Garden Burgers served on white or wheat buns. Their mushroom veggie burger on whole wheat bun is awesome.
  Pita Pit is closed, the rest of this paragraph is now moot.  Pita Pit has a rather extensive selection, and employees are conscious of various vegetarian concerns and take great pains to prepare vegetarian food on special surfaces that do not at all come into contact with meat. Excellent salads served with really good choice of dressings. The The California Aggie Aggie wrote a http://www.californiaaggie.com/news/2004/10/07/Arts/Drunken.Bar.Hoppers.And.Vegetarians.Have.A.New.Place.To.Eat1318256.shtml review about The Pit when it opened.
   Pita Pit has five or six veggie selections, including falafel and hummus. They are careful about not making veggie stuff on the grill where the meat is cooked, and also about changing their gloves if theyve just made a pita with meat in it. They are one of the few restaurants in Davis that are Night Time open late.
   They arent necessarily always that vegetarianconscious, it really depends on who you get and how much they care. It is important that you ask that they microwave anything that would normally be cooked on the nonvegetarianfriendly grill  Users/KristenBirdsall
   We always ask people if they want anything microwaved and tell them we cook meats on the grill.  So if they are a vegetarian we can accommadate.  Users/JackkiCox

  Sams Mediterranean has a really good falafel that is definitely worth checking out over Pita Pit. And the best fries in town.

 Mexican / Mexican Influenced 
  Dos Coyotes has many vegetarian friendly options. Many of their salads, quesadillas, and burritos can be ordered vegetarian. Dos Coyotes also has seasonal vegetarian specials at all of their locations that can be seen on their website or on the specials board at the restaurant.
  Chipotle is decently vegetarianfriendly but they just dont have as many options as the other Mexican Food Mexican restaurants in Davis in general.  However, you can get a bowl of rice, black beans and cheese for under $2.00 and add the free soda if you have a reg card and you have one cheap meal (a cautionary piece of advice: there is one lady there who charges more. Technically youre getting 3 sides but she charges for a quesadilla and something else.  Maybe thats what theyre supposed to do?)
      Their current website says our cheese is made from a vegetablebased rennet and is therefore vegetarian. However, the last time I visited their website (about a year ago), their website said, Our cheese is made from an animalbased rennet and is therefore not vegetarian. I find this interesting, and wonder if Chipotle simply changed the type of cheese that they use, or just screwed up their food labeling on their website either then or now. Anyone have any knowledge about this?
      I believe they actually changed the kind of cheese they used.  At about that same time they started emphasizing their vegetarian product line more, and overhauled their menu.
  Taqueria Davis  Vegan and vegetarian burritos are available. The vegan burrito comes with grilled vegetables, veggie rice, guacamole, pico de gallo, and your choice of beans. The vegetarian burritos (regular or super) have cheese and lack the grilled vegetables.
  Taqueria Guadalajara lists a vegetarian burrito on their menu, but this is only accurate at the North Davis location. The North Davis Location has changed their recipe to remove the chorizo from their beans and now use vegetable stock for their rice. The manager stated that they did this to accommodate their Davis clientele. Their guacamole is dairyfree as well. The South Davis Location has not made these changes, despite continuing to list a vegetarian burrito on the menu.

   I just called the South Davis location today 12292008 to ask if they still use meat in their beans and rice, and they confirmed that they still do. I just cant understand how they can get away with this for so long.Users/Brett

   One time, I ordered a plain quesadilla  tortilla with cheese in the middle. When I picked it up to eat it, there were chunks of meat stuck to the bottom of it. Needless to say, I was thoroughly annoyed. However, Ive since learned to appreciate their vegetarian burritos simply because I live so close to the place. But Ill echo what someone else said, make sure you order it with black beans. Id also recommend no extra pico.  Users/TerraSmithers
   According to the Taqueria Guadalajara page, Guad uses chicken broth in making their rice. I dont know if this is true, but it means a lot of their items wouldnt be vegetarian at all, including the vegetarian burrito. Users/GeoffJohnson

 Sandwiches 
Also see Sandwiches.
  Nugget has an extensive selection of toppings for yummy fresh veggie sandwiches. (Recommended: The Veggie on a croissant with havarti cheese). They also have an awesome veggie soup on certain days, and tons of pasta salads and other goodies from their deli section.
    Their vegetarian panini is really good.
  Sunrise Restaurant has a vegetarian Vietnamese sandwich with tofu on a crispy toasted baguette for $2.50
  tea list has great garden vegetable or peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, with organic, locally grown ingredients and bread from The Village Bakery!
  Zias Delicatessen has a tomato/fresh mozzarella sandwich, a frittata sandwich, as well as a few vegetarian friendly salads. If you ask for a vegan sandwich they will make one with roasted red peppers, pepperoncini, marinated artichokes and/or mushrooms. Good stuff.
  Davis Food CoOp has a tofu sandwich that is good. But their sandwich makers always seem to take longer than they should.

  Ive had a subscription to the Student Farm Veggie Baskets for the last six months or so. They are great! You get lots of fresh organic veggies for a great price. Its a good option for those who want to eat healthy but cant afford the Supermarkets supermarket organic prices. The basket is more (quite more) than enough for two people. You can go to the http://studentfarm.ucdavis.edu/ Student Farm webpage for more information. Users/AnaluciaCordova Ana Lucia

 Thai 
 Thai Nakorn has a great vegetarian lunch special. you get a spring roll(may have egg in it) and also a vegetarian soup, steamed rice, and fruit. this comes with a vegetarian entree, tofu or vegetables $5.25. one of the few Thai places that have lunch specials. perhaps the best Thai food in davis. my brother really likes the eggplant lovers with tofu. Users/MattHh
  (Note that 2k is now KetMoRee, the following may no longer apply). 2k Thai Food has the best Thai Restaurants food in town.  Try the panang (peanut curry) with tofu.
   Here, and at all the other Thai restaurants in Davis, you order just about anything on their menu with tofu in place of meat.
   This Restaurants restaurant gives generous portions and is reasonably priced, but it isnt the best Thai restaurants Thai restaurant in town.  Theyre pretty much on par with each other overall.
  Thai Recipes has a lot of good tofu dishes, though unfortunately its kind of expensive. I believe it was voted one of the most vegetarianfriendly restaurants in Davis a few years back.
        Thai Recipes also makes their dishes vegan if you ask them to.  No fish sauce, no hidden shrimp paste like Sophias Thai Kitchen Sophias.  Users/MarleneMyers
         Actually, some of their curries are made in part with Mae Ploy brand curry paste. These often have shrimp paste in them. So, youve got to ask about each specific curry to be sure. Its probably safer to order one a vegetarian stirfry to be sure.  Users/BrianMartinez
  I dont know about 2k Thai Food, however Sophias Thai Kitchen Sophias has always been very friendly about preparing dishes without fish sauce.  Also, if you want something that is fried, make sure the oil isnt used to cook their meat products!  Users/KimKunaniec
   After eating at Sophias Thai Kitchen Sophias for a year and getting dishes made without fish sauce, a server recently informed me that they cant make their curry dishes vegetarian because they all contain shrimp paste.  Most wait staff wont tell you this, so beware!  Users/MarleneMyers

Vietnamese
  Sunrise Restaurant has a decent selection of tasty, vegetarian dishes.

  VeganConscious reviews 
Ill leave it to you vege/vegatarians, but maybe this section should go on the vegan page?
  Delta of Venus has a number of vegan options, and you can make almost anything vegan, too. They use soy mayo on the vegan sandwiches and can use it on the Meat Lab nonvegan ones to make those vegan too. Most of the brunch menu contains eggs, and for 50 cents you can have it with tofu instead. Just make sure to let them know vegan so they dont put butter on your bread, too.
  Sams Mediterranean Sams and Ali Baba offer several vegan entrees including falafel, dolma, and hummus with pita. Ali Babas veggie special is an ideal vegan dish...just ask for no yogurt on the side.
   Subway Subway has a veggie sub, it costs a lot less than all the other ones, and when ordered without cheese or mayonnaise is vegan.
     make sure to ask for some of the hidden veggies like spinach, carrots etc.  it makes your sub taste much better and less processed. Users/MattHh
     Isnt their bread made from animal byproducts?
       According to http://www.subway.com their website, the Italian breads bread is made with no animal byproducts. Other breads are vegetarian, but may contain honey or cheese.
       http://www.subway.com/subwayroot/MenuNutrition/Nutrition/pdf/AllergenChart.pdf Ingredients chart
  Thai Recipes has a whole vegetarian section on its menu. In actuality it should read vegan. Every dish in this section is vegan or can be made vegan. Even some of the desserts. Watch out for their fried foods (e.g. Thai rolls, fried banana) though. It is fried in the same oil as their fishcakes. Some vegns arent bothered by this though.
