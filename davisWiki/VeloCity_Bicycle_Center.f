20070723 14:21:19 nbsp This is exactly what Winters was lacking.  I try to stop in and support VeloCity every time I am on a ride that takes me out to Winters.  Everyone I have had the opportunity to converse with at the shop was both knowledgeable and courteous.  A friend of mine went down hard on a ride just outside of Winters and Myke performed a quick fix and tuneup free of charge.  I highly recommend this shop. Users/DavidGrundler
