There are two tiers of Verizon:  Verizon Corporate and Verizon Retailers.  Corporate stores are owned and operated by Verizon. Premium Retailers are independent businesses that sell Verizon phones and plans. Verizon Corporate stores have live phones that you can see and use. Premium Retailers may not offer all of the promotions and sales of a Verizon Corporate store. Some Premium Retailers use nonworking display phones instead of real phones. Corporate stores are places where you can pay your bills and have the full range of Verizon services while some Premium Retailers may not have bill pay capability or the full range of products and plans.
