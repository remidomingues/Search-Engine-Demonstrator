The Vermomster is a Ben & Jerrys giant 40 dollar hot fudge sundae that consists of twenty scoops of ice cream (which is roughly four and a half pounds), three cookies, four bananas, one brownie, four ladles of hot fudge, ten scoops of peanuts, three scoops of sprinkles, three scoops of M&Ms, and a whole lot of whip cream. In total, it weighs six to seven pounds.

If you want one from the Ben & Jerrys in Davis it is best to call ahead.

There is also an annual Ben & Jerrys: Vermonster Challenge Vermonster Challenge where teams race to eat a Vermonster for charity.

20041218 19:35:58 nbsp I have worked at Ben & Jerrys for over five years and have seen many people try to eat the Vermnoster on their own and they fail every time. When I was working in Berkeley I saw the School band forse 4 blindfolded Freshmen to eat one. They finished in 15 minutes. But I think a couple of them threw up.   Users/RobRoy

20060326 00:36:17 nbsp Youre right Steve. The funny thing is when I was hanging out with ben and Jerry thi spast January Ben is now the thin one and Jerry is the heavier one. Also, Ben  who has a beard in all the cartoons of the pair  now is clean shaven and Jerry has the beard. I guess Ben got a little to close to death and now he wised up.
