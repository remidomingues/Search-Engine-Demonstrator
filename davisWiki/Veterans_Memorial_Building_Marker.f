In front of the Veterans Memorial Building there is a marker bearing the inscription In memory of those who gave their lives for our freedom. On it are carved the names of those from Davis who died in service to their country in World War II, the Korean War, and Vietnam. The list of World War I veterans is longer than the other three wars, because it includes the names of individuals from all of Yolo County who died while in the armed services during that conflict. The marker was erected by Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 6949 Post 6949 of the V.F.W. There is a similar Davis Cemetery Veterans Marker marker by the flagpole at the Davis Cemetery.
