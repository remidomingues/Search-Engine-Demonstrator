The Veterinary Bookstore is a satellite of the UC Davis Bookstore. Located next to the Health Sciences library, the bookstore can be relatively hard to find if you are not familiar with the Health Sciences Complex. Selling items from food to gifts and school supplies, the bookstore focuses primarily on Veterinary literature and preparatory material. Textbooks and Syllabi for School of Veterinary Medicine Vet students are purchased here. They also sell medical instruments like stethoscopes, ophthalmoscopes and dissection kits.
