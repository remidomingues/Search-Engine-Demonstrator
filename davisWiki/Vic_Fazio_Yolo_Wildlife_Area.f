The Vic Fazio Yolo Wildlife Area is located along I80 at the Yolo Causeway between Davis and Sacramento.

The Vic Fazio Yolo Wildlife Area is a 3,700 acres (15 km²) wetland restoration project constructed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers and Ducks Unlimited within the Yolo Bypass Wildlife Area located in the Yolo Bypass between here and Sacramento. The Yolo Causeway, part of I80, runs through it. The restoration was named for Congressman Vic Fazio, who lobbied for the project and was instrumental in appropriating funds for the initial construction.

The project was dedicated on November 17th, 1997 by wiki:WikiPedia:Bill_Clinton Bill Clinton, who hailed the project as a national model for meeting the challenge of trying to improve our economy and lift our standard of living while improving, not diminishing, our environment. The facility is managed by the California Department of Fish and Game http://www.dfg.ca.gov/ California Department of Fish & Game while the educational programs and public tours are administered by the Yolo Basin Foundation in partnership with Fish and Game.This partnership and its success have been widely regarded as a model for planning and completion of other wetland projects within the Yolo Bypass.

In 2001, the Wildlife Area expanded to over 16,000 acres (65 km²) through the acquisition of the Glide and Los Rios properties. Since this time, extensive wetland enhancement and restoration projects have proceeded rapidly. The Department of Fish and Game has incorporated agriculture into the management of the property to generate operating income and to provide wildlife habitat. During the winter, large flocks of Ducks ducks and Waterbirds geese can been seen here as well as at the Davis Wetlands.  There is an auto tour route that is open from sunrise to sunset unless flooded.  Docentled tours are available on the second Saturday of each month  which makes a nice compliment to the docentled tours available on the first Saturday of each month at the Davis Wetlands.

The floodplain that makes up the Yolo Bypass receives water from the Sacramento River and provides an Important Bird Area of the Pacific Flyway for an impressive variety of waterfowl.Unless the area is impassable due to normal seasonal flooding, a dirt and gravel road is open to the public for driving and walking tours, and a docentled tour is given once per month.


Does midlateJuly tend to be a good time to go birdwatching here?   Users/CovertProfessor
 Dawn is best! oh time of year... They are all about the same... The place has alot of winter migrants in the winter and the spring has nesting season. Right now in the summer things are sorta placid, not much going on except looking for food. Daubert
  Ok, thanks!  I have an out of town friend who likes to birdwatch... as long as they are there to see I dont imagine my friend will care too much what they are doing. Dawn is unlikely but well see what we can do.  :) cp
