Hi im Vicki and i like to do lots of stuff. I play ultimate frisbee and participate in SOS staff this year as well as next year, when i will become publicity. I believe that this is sooooo close to a personal ad, so i refuse to make it for myself. but really, I am cool. too cool for you fool. i also broke my collarbone this year while laying out for the disc. I crashed into someone....cough Users/MarionEveridge cough. When Im not injured, frisbee people call me McSlip because I have issues staying on my feet. Right now i live in Arlington Farms Arlington, which, while it is cool, gets a little A crowd, if you know what i mean. Seriously, Ive never seen so many girls wake up at 8 am just to get the first tanning rays and stay out til 6 at night to get the last. Its most definetly a Communications major type of area...yeahhhhh...thats ok, theyll all get skin cancer, and then ill laugh, and ill have the pool all to myself.
