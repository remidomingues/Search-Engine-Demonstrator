Vicki Swett was the ASUCD Student Government Advisor Advisor of the ASUCD until her retirement in 2004. The ASUCD Student Government Advisor ASUCD Advisor advises the various government entities that are in the ASUCD, including the different commissions and committees as well as the ASUCD ASUCD Senate Legislative, ASUCD President Executive, and ASUCD Court Judicial branches. At first impression she appeared to be a sweet lady, but once you are her bad side shed give you the cows icy stare of death and would try to destroy you with it. Her blond stylized hair reminds us of the 1980&#8217;s and its wild haircuts of yesteryear. Her office was on the third floor of the MU next the SGAO. She often could be seen with Mark Champagne lunching in the Memorial Union MU Coffee House talking about floss.

She retired in December of 2004 and was replaced by Eric Sanchez.  She served the ASUCD for 31 years.  This change of regime will allow ASUCD to set a new path in the future, as the ASUCD Student Government Advisor student government advisor has a huge amount of influence over their years in the job.

Vicki has many supporters, as exemplified in Senate Resolution #5 (not online yet, passed 12/2/2004), which praised her years of service and passed without objection.  She also has quite a few detractors, who call her the http://www.livejournal.com/users/emosnail/77347.html manifestation of all that is evil. And some people even call her an Ã¼ber troll, while others have been yelled at by her for saying she doesnt care or understand.

Incidentally, the position of ASUCD Student Government Advisor ASUCD Advisor and SGAO of which she was the head, both do not have Administrative Plans. Administrative Plans describe the function, responsibilities and duties of every unit in ASUCD, and Government Codes Chapter Four is devoted to them.  Every ASUCD unit must have one according to the first paragraph of that chapter.  This is significant because many claim that Vickis influence far exceeded the function she was supposed to have, and she would often refuse to have the SGAO do administrative work for people or units she didnt like, notably the ASUCD Court judiciary.
