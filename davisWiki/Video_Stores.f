  http://www.blockbusterexpress.com/findkiosk/ Blockbuster Express had DVD rental kiosks at the West Covell and South Davis Safeway locations. $3 for the first night and $1 for each additional night for new releases. After 28 days of the DVD release, it will be $2 for the first night. For DVDs older than 90 days, it will be $1 per night. Blockbuster Express was a DVD rental kiosk service that was owned by NCR corporation. The rental kiosks were sold to Redbox. Redbox replaced all of the Blockbuster Express kiosks with Redbox machines.



does either Longs have a video rental program? also, some Supermarkets & Grocery Stores sell videos, but i dont know which ones. Users/ArlenAbraham
 I know that Nugget, Albertsons and Safeway sell videos, but should they go here?  They arent video stores.  But, then, neither are Walmart, Target, Costco, the UCD Bookstore Bookstore, etc....What do you think? Users/SummerSong ss
 Hmmm.... I guess as long as were listing places one can purchase videos, any store that sells videos should be on the list. After all, the person who visits this page will most likely want a fairly complete listing of places they can buy/rent videos. I agree though, that just about every little hole in the wall sells some sort of videos anymore, which could lead to a long list of seemingly unrelated businesses. Maybe changing the page title and/or adding subcategories of video stores v. stores selling videos would clear up any confusion. I rather like including Mom/Pop stores like International Food Market, because I doubt that most of the other places carry Bollywood vids. Users/AlphaDog
   side note: more people buy DVDs at walmart than any other retailer in the US. Users/ArlenAbraham
