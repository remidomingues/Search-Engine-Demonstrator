Videos To Go is cheaper than Blockbuster, and is independently owned, like 49er Video. The ownership and management changed in May 2007. Their selection of new releases isnt great, but if you have a VCR or want to watch an old movie, then this is certainly your place.

Welcome to Videos to go. Here is some information that will hopefully come in handy for current and future customers:
We are a privately owned business and we need to protect our inventory and at the same time try to keep our prices fair. For this reasons we would like you to know our policies and provide some information on how we came about them. Thanks to my staff, friends and loyal customers, Videos to Go has begun and will become a better video store. Hopefully the following information will help create a helpful dialogue between management and customers. We welcome any suggestions at videostogoservice@yahoo.com.

As of May 1st, 2007, Videos to Go is under new management. We do hope that you will have a better experience if at any other time you ever had a negative experience. We will be beautifying the store and making our stock more accessible. We are currently trying to sell most of our VHS so that we can buy more DVDs and provide a better selection. Most of our New Releases are changed to 4 night rentals after a few weeks of being released. Our prices are lower than other rental stores, even with our late fees. For example, if you keep a 1 night rental 1 extra night, the movie will only cost you $4.00 with tax included. If we do not have a title that you are looking for we will add it to our list and will order it for you for rent or purchase. The purchase price for a new DVD will vary, but we will only charge you our distributor price+tax+shipping. We show our customers the screen so they can see for themselves that we are charging them our price. Purchase orders are usually ready by the following Wednesday.
For those of you who do have trouble returning movies on time:
Of course we would prefer that all movies be returned on time (by 8:00pm on the due date). The way I see it is return your movies on time and have a better chance of finding the movie you are looking for in stock. But of course life happens and we understand if you do not return a movie on time. Our late fees are very low ($0.50$1.00/day). Our employees call our customers daily to remind them that their movies are more than 3 days late. We try very hard to avoid resorting to charging your credit card for the movies or reporting you to a collection agency. I just dont think its fair. So as long as you let us know that you will be returning the movies you will never get an unexpected charge on your credit card from us. In almost 4 years that I have been working in this business I have yet to see someone get charged for unreturned movies. Yey, please help us keep it that way!.
Policies on Faulty DVDs and VHS:
From time to time we do get a few faulty DVDs in circulation. We do apologize for this. To help avoiding this we have just purchased a new DVD repair machine that we will put to work as soon as it arrives. We will try to go through every DVD in stock to improve the rental quality of our stock. We would appreciate it if you let us know if a DVD is faulty so that we can take it out of circulation until it is fixed, sometimes the physical appearance is not enough to determine the quality of the dvd. In the mean time we will gladly give you a credit or exchange for the same titled movie and receive an extra day on your movie. Faulty DVD/VHS have to be exchanged within the rental period. This is because for most cases the DVD can be fixed with a simple clean. If you do not bring the DVD within the rental period then we lose the opportunity of renting the movie and thus lose a customer who would have wanted the movie you returned late. So please do not think that just because the DVD did not work on your DVD player it is not working and think that it will not matter that you have returned it late. If you cannot bring in the faulty DVD or VHS then just give us a call to notify us.
Reserving Movies:
We do offer same day reservations. This is so all our customers get a fair chance of getting the movies they were looking for. About 90% of those who make reservations forget about them and we are left with a movie on the shelf waiting to be picked up and by the time those who made the reservations decide to calls us back (after we have called them as soon as we get the movie in) they tell us that they forgot, changed their minds or worst of all had gone to the BIG Chain store to get the movie. Very annoying to us and those customers who could have left happily with their movie.
About the beautification of the store:
I do have to admit that the store did have some funky smell, but it was because our back doors used to be opened in the morning to let some fresh air in, but instead a funky smell was let in from the outside. So thanks to finally noticing this, cleaning the store more efficiently, adding some plants and of course B&BW wallflowers the store has a nice pleasant smell. We are working very hard to reorganize everything so that it is easier to find. We hope to have our finished product by the end of the summer or even earlier. Do not be discouraged from coming in to the store before seeing the final product! If you cant find something right away please ask, it might be on our AFI, Drive In, or our new section that we are still working on. We do hope you will be pleased with the beautification. For those of you who have commented on our successful progress we honestly thank you, because due to all the positive comments you give us more hope and strength to keep it going.

So please come in and see for yourselves that Videos to Go is on the road to becoming better than before.
Thanks,
Management

Other Video Stores video rental options in Davis include the Davis Branch Library. If you cant remember the name of that hip and interesting title you were hoping to mention at Cafe Roma Roma, try their Cult section.

The store has been taken over by Expressions Hair Design.

20051222 11:21:32 nbsp I take back everything nice I said before. We had a terrible experience there yesterday. The employee accused us of not returning a dvd we rented last weekend, when i said i had returned it he essentially called me a liar. Even though there were big stacks of rentals that behind the counter, he refused to look for it. I tried contacting the store today to speak to owner/manager and a man with a heavy accent said the owner was never there. i asked for a mailing address where the owner would receive my letter and the man refused. I then asked for the mans name, he hung up on me. The quality of service has really gone down. Update as of 1/2/06: After i wrote management a letter and made a complaint to the BBB, the DVD was found by the store. They didnt bother to call me though, I had to call them to make sure. Users/MyaBrn

20060529 22:22:14 nbsp MyaBrn, I work for Videos To Go, and Id just like to say that Im really sorry this happened. I recall this incident, but I wasnt working during those days. However, we fired the guy for being so rude and unwilling to help customers. Users/BabiBlujay

20080305 10:53:59 nbsp I went to 49er video last week because their copy of Darjeeling was rented out. I ended up paying like 2 dollars more there for a rental. I highly recommend checking this place first, though it would be nice if they carried a few more of the new releases. Users/GregMediati

20080629 16:17:48 nbsp Hey Dudek, this response is about two years too late, but yeah, theyre pretty cool about late fees.

This store is awsome. They have a lot of oddball stuff, as well as the hits.  Users/DavidFeliz
