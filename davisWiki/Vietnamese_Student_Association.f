Vietnamese Student Association is a social club at UC Davis founded in 1981.

We promote Vietnamese culture on and around campus to everyone interested in the Vietnamese culture; share current events and social issues surrounding the Vietnamese worldwide; and provide philanthropy to Vietnamesebased organizations yearround.

VSA at UCD is among the most active Vietnamese Student Associations in Northern California.

We strive to continue the Vietnamese traditions, for fear of it becoming extinct as the new generation replaces the old. We must continue to strengthen and continue the Vietnamese language and culture! And we can only do so with the participation of members  like YOU!

Our two biggest events of the year are our annual BikeAThon and Culture Show. Our BikeAThon is a ful day of adventure in which participants from all over California bike from Davis and Sacramento back. The Culture Show is is a night where we showcase Vietnamese culture through acting, singing and dancing! We are always looking for new volunteers and participants so feel free to contact us if you are interested!

So, join us because together we can make VSA prosper and continue to grow at UC Davis!
