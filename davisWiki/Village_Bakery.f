Village Bakery makes excellent breads bread, Cookies, Pastries, and Baked Goods pastries, and Pizza pizza. Located directly across from the Amtrak Station, the bakerys storefront easily goes unnoticed. There are three indoor tables and four outside, providing plenty of pleasant seating Outdoor Activities outside. Do not confuse them with their recently opened restaurant called Village Pizza and Grill on the corner of G Street and 4th Street.

After 2pm all muffins, scones, and croissants are $1

Pizza can be bought by the slice from 11amclosing; this may be the best pizza in all of Davis. They also deliver, but make sure to specify credit card when ordering. Slices are large and cost $2.25 for cheese, $2.50 for pepperoni, $2.75 for vegetarian options vegetarian, and $3 for veggie meat combo. There is usually a cheese, a pepperoni and some sort of vegetable combination (Vegetarian or Eggplant or any other veggie combo). This is excellent Cheap Food. Sometimes late in the day (i.e. dinner time) they will be sold out of pizza in the rotating glass case, in which case one should ask for another of (fill in the type) to be made and it can probably be made in around five minutes unless the pizza slaves are experiencing some sort of terrible nightmare of a rush in the back (case in point the night of January 5, 2007).


The Bakerys bread can also be bought onsite or at the Davis Food Coop a couple of blocks away, or in Sacramento at http://www.taylorsmarket.com/ Taylors Market on Freeport Boulevard.  Village Bakery supplies bread to a number of local restaurants, including buns for The Hotdogger, Delta of Venus, Enzos, Mishkas Cafe as well as all the Plutos locations. In the summer of 2005, Village Bakery opened a baking facility on Spafford Street in Mace Ranch and relocated all their commercial baking from the downtown store. This freed up the downtown location to focus on counter service and pizza. The Spafford location does not have a customer counter.

Several editors have complained about extra charges on their credit cards when used to purchase from Village Bakery, although this is supposed to happen as a normal part of an authorization hold, some have implied that it is more than that; caveat emptor.

Village Bakery used to provide the bread for the South Davis Nugget Nugget, some of which was wrapped with paper bags reading Village Bakery, others which have Nugget bags which match the Village Bakery ones.

The Village Bakery also has an espresso machine which has made the bakery a popular spot for train riders to get some caffeine before or after their trip. To accompany coffee are various muffins, pastries, and linzer tortes. Their Napoleons are filled with custard and are much easier to eat than traditional Napoleons because they are bunshaped instead of rectangular.

Plus the wait staff is really hot and they deliver.

20090114 00:25:54 nbsp I dont know what it is about their pizza that makes it so good; it just is. If youve never been there, stop by and grab a bite to eat before you go on a train ride. Next time you have a dinner party or potluck, buy a roll of fresh bread from the Village Bakery.  Users/AmanpreetSingh

20090126 23:32:18 nbsp I am no pizza snob, but after trying all of the pizzas in Davis, Village Bakery emerges victorious. Symposium is a close second for deep dish pizza. Village Bakery pizzas always have high quality and fresh ingredients along with a great tasting crust. The staff are always super nice, too. Users/CoffeeSnobDavis

20090210 16:26:56 nbsp The pizza is at least heavenly, so much so that there are delays periodically; that seems natural to me, like how free ways are sometimes crowded about the fourth of July and such, people can deliver orders in rushes (by telephone included) and do a grand job at occasionallyoverwhelming the staff very much.  As for the illegal bussiness practices that are alleged to exist, specifically keeping in mind how undocumented or illegal workers might be underpaid, Id say that it is proper to be aware and on the lookout for such dealings, yet if anyone makes concrete (hard) accusations that such trouble exists then they had best have evidence just as solid otherwise that is slander or liable(depending) and that can be as damaging.  With the posts o LetJusticeBeServed and GeorgeBush in mind I have a mind to say that if Someone makes a Public Notice  Try having some proof to presentbecause how do You really know?Do you even?  Have you seen forged documents or even asked the employees any questions? What did they say?  When?  Have you gone by whats called, a wellknown fact throughout Davis(GeorgeBush) then?  Ive resided in Davis for about ten years; this is the first time Ive heard of that wellknow fact.  Then again, the pizza is delicious, and the desserts are too. I can attest to such truely, as Ive been in person; that was near to two months, too long, ago when my senses proved the like as sure as night is dark and day is light. Users/KhayyamShah

20090305 21:07:17 nbsp I used to always walk by here on my way to the Amtrak and wondered how their food tasted. After finally getting the chance, I was overjoyed!  Great tasting pizza, good prices, and wonderful service!  Two thumbs up :) Users/renee415

20090320 18:30:12 nbsp This is by far my favorite pizza place in Davis.  My Davisbornandraised husband is a loyal Woodstocks fan, but for me, Village Bakery has the best crust, sauce, and the Veggie slices have the perfect mix of flavor and texture.  It doesnt taste too greasy, and the vegetables arent overwhelmed by a sauce that tastes like tomato paste.  Mmmm...On occasion, when my husband orders from Woodstocks, Ive been known to place a separate order from Village Bakery.  Its made for an awkward moment when the delivery guys arrive at about the same time, but I think a few seconds of awkwardness is a small price to pay for marital harmony and satisfied taste buds. Users/MBriggs

20090415 11:54:44 nbsp Very good pizza, esp for the price.
One time I went there years ago as they were closing. I wanted one piece, and they had a whole fresh pizza that they would not sell by closing time. They gave all of it to me for the price of slice. It was AWESOME. Love them. Users/LotsofThoughts

20090524 16:17:09 nbsp I FINALLY tried village pizza the other day. My dad and I stopped in for a quick slice of pepperoni. All in all the pizza was good, but I wish it had more sauce. The crust was nice and chewy but slightly crispy on the bottom, and the cheese was PERFECT for pizza (I love when I take a bite and the cheese just stretches and stretches!) I would definitely go there again if I just wanted a slice, but other wise, I still prefer Steves. Users/BrookeB

20090529 16:17:52 nbsp Great news for anyone who loves Village Bakerys pizza as much as I do: The old house being remodeled on 4th and G just had a sign put up the other day reading Village Pizza and Grill in the same lettering style as the bakery. (opening in July) Im not sure if this restaurant is owned by Village Bakery (if anyone can confirm, that would be great!), but Id sure bet it is. I couldnt be more excited about this restaurant opening if my hunch is correct; I LOVE Village Bakerys pizza and would equally love enjoying it on an outdoor patio with a cold brew during the summer. Fingers crossed!  Users/chellebelle1685

20090529 19:21:18 nbsp I just called them and they said it really is Village Bakery, and the current location will also stay open. Yay! Village Bakery is awesome. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20090530 18:58:21 nbsp Correct.  Aziz, the owner of Village Bakery, is opening up the new restaurant.  It has been in planning for a long time and under construction for a bit.  I havent talked to him in a while, so I dont remember when the exact opening date is. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20090607 17:47:22 nbsp Their lunch special is currently $5.50 (+tax, I imagine).  It includes a slice of pizza, a can of soda (or bottled juice), and a salad. The guy behind the counter told me the special is for anytime. Ive only had their vegetarian pizza. Its good.  I also like the tables outside, nice atmosphere this time of year (MayJune). Users/RonB

20090615 17:52:44 nbsp Looking forward to the new location, Village Bakery may have my favorite pizza in town! Highly recommend the Veggie. Users/JamesWaterhouse

20090617 17:14:17 nbsp My favorite pizza in town. cannot wait for the new location! Users/CreeSmithers

20090714 20:36:57 nbsp Desserts are to die for!  Great portions and awesome pricing! Users/davisgirl10

20090724 14:47:52 nbsp Does anyone have any new info on the new restaurant? Is it open yet, or opening soon? Users/jsogul

  Inside word is that he wants to open it within the next week, but I have a feeling it wont be until as late as the end of next month. Well see... Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20090726 19:54:24 nbsp Best pizza in davis by far!!!  if you havent had a slice, go now! Users/ADP

20090801 23:42:38 nbsp the best pizza in town bar none!
I hope they keep the lunch special at the new location. $5.50 slice salad drink.
Best in town. Users/jonjon

20090816 14:54:40 nbsp I read previous comments about the undocumented workers, that sucks for americans, but they still make some darn good pizza Users/lajolla4joya

20090826 10:26:02 nbsp Anyone go to the new location yet? Users/SonnyStack

20090909 16:50:51 nbsp I love this place  best pizza in town!  Check out review here:  http://sacfoodies.com/2009/09/09/pizzaweekcontinuedvillagebakery/ Users/ChristineSchunk

20090925 17:47:50 nbsp This is my favorite place to get pizza in Davis, BY FAR!
I went to their new location a few weeks after opening.  I wasnt very impressed by their service but I assume the bugs will get worked out soon.  The food was excellent and the wines are local!  I will be returning soon.     Users/UMDGrad

20091017 21:39:12 nbsp I ordered a pick up pizza from village bakery tonight. When I went to pick it up the nice lady at the front told me it had been burned a bit and offered to give me a discount ($3 off). The pizza wasnt that bad  just a little crispier than normal around the edges. This was an awesome gesture that she certainly didnt have to do and its a great example of the kind of customer service I wish I could see more often in Davis. Village bakery is the best pizza in Davis.  Users/ARWENNHOLD

20091221 09:51:56 nbsp I love the new location and menu. It is comparable to Burgers & Brew but with better seating and a larger menu. This is my new favorite place to eat out in Davis. Users/GJC02

Really???? I dont see how this can be compared it definitely does NOT have better seating.. perhaps wrong restaurant?

20100121 21:06:52 nbsp We wanted the asiago cheese bread but the Coop was out, so we went to VB  turns out they were out even earlier! Our whole family love those, especially sliced and toasted...mmm.. Users/LeeY

20100129 17:47:34 nbsp Stopped in today to have the lunch special, a slice, drink and salad. It was pretty good. Also got a piece of Tiramisu which was okay too. The pizza is good, but dont know that its the best Ive ever had. Very fresh, though. Users/redbike

20100205 10:16:37 nbsp Hands down the BEST pizza in Davis, the employees here have always been nice and friendly. Users/DagonJones

20100705 20:01:58 nbsp This is the best pizza in Davis. Davis needs Italian food and more pizza choices. Woodstocks doesnt quite match up to Round Table and RT isnt that good in this town. Luckily, there is some decent pizza. Nice bread (I miss Bouchon Bakery), and wonderful cream puffs for $1.25 apiece. My partner gives a rating of 8 or 9 /10.  Users/seesharp

20100716 17:17:08 nbsp Best pizza and scones, and cool atmosphere. Users/JasperD

20100803 03:42:53 nbsp I love this place, friendly staff and great pizza! Users/Saher

20101124 21:35:10 nbsp LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE. You havent lived until youve tried one of their croissants. My son, who is 11, says he never wants to move from Davis because of Village Bakery. Users/JasperD

20110324 16:40:47 nbsp Took me years to figure out they have breakfast items like muffins and scones. Their blueberry muffins are soooo good! I am addicted :) Users/Ravyn

20110324 21:14:33 nbsp Great EPI bread!  Just dont make the same mistake I made and assume that when they open at 5:30 am they will have fresh baked goods...  I thought I would bring in goodies for the office, but they dont get delivery from their Spafford location until around 6:30ish. Users/BigGuy

20110412 20:27:18 nbsp When I graduate next year and leave Davis, this place will probably be the only thing I miss. The pizza is THAT good and their lunch deal makes it even better. Users/ElizabethWood

20110517 17:35:49 nbsp Tried pizza here for the first time last Friday (May 13,2011), and I must say everytime I am in need for a quick bite in Downtown Davis, I am heading over to this Village Bakery.
However the thing I really dont like is that they close super early because after I got off work I decided to go back for another couple of slices, and they were closed. :(
But props on the TASTY pizza.!
 Users/NikhilDahal

20110517 21:41:56 nbsp Also worth knowing that they have a presence at the Davis Farmers Market on a Saturday. Find them at the northwestern end of the covered bit. They dont sell pizza here, but they do have a range of breads. Users/KevinWeedon

20110627 21:49:15 nbsp The best pizza in Davis.  The bread is great too, but I consume more of the pizza.  Even their restaurant doesnt make the pizza as good.  I lived in NYC and it was nice finding a place that sells by the slice all day for a reasonable price.  Its simple, its good, try it. Users/BobJames

20110630 19:07:13 nbsp Usually I love this place but I got two slices of pizza (one cheese, one veggie) last night and they were both pretty bad. The dough was really tough and hard to chew. I got through about half of each piece and had to give up. They were also even greasier than usual.

I still think Village Bakery has the best pizza in Davis but they need to work on being consistent. They also might want to consider dropping the credit card fee.

I definitely recommend the roasted red bell pepper and goat cheese pizza  I wish they sold it by the slice. Users/MeggoWaffle

20110822 07:08:18 nbsp My favorite pizza in Davis. Everything is great here from the slices, to the great pizzas you can order, to the cheap delicious desserts. Users/KurtG

20111210 16:27:04 nbsp Best, best, best ever. Users/KarbonMeatson

20111216 17:05:15 nbsp Pizza here is AWESOME! and great prices! Users/JeffA

20120127 14:16:48 nbsp Best veggie pizza ever. Users/RoamingDavisite

20120316 06:17:54 nbsp Just went to this place for the first time today. and I have to say it was a disappointment, not the food but rather the lack of it. In my experience when a bakery opens it already has some pastries out of the oven and ready for sale. But if you are hoping to get something to eat that isnt dessert or leftovers when waiting for an early morning Amtrak. You will have to wait until at least 6:30 before they even have anything fresh. Another thing to point out, dont get their cappuccino unless your like your morning coffee to taste like hot dirt. Users/HGibson

20120409 22:57:19 nbsp Simply the best bakery in town. The most savory focaccia bread on the planet. And one of the best veggie pizzas ever tasted. Its awesome making a quick stop here and just chilling at their outside patio :)  Users/MelannieLavarias

20120717 08:35:01 nbsp Great place for an inexpensive yet delicious slice of pizza or a french baguette to go.   Users/Trena

20120813 01:00:13 nbsp To me, sitting outside the bench with a slice of their pizza, watching the A bus drive by and the Amtrak train make a stop at the station made Village Bakery a great stop to grab a slice.  Users/Davekhuh

20121115 19:13:38 nbsp Ordered from them tonight for delivery.  The person on the phone spoke very poor English.  Nonetheless, over the course of a 5 minute phone call (seriously), I gave him my phone number, address and credit card number.  I was told the pizza would take an hour.  Over an hour later, I got a call from them.  Another person, again who spoke barely a word of English, told me he needed my credit card number again.  It took some time to make sure he got the numbers, again.  I told him I was concerned that they didnt have my address since they had trouble w/ my card number (yet apparently had no problem with my phone number, which I chalk up to caller ID).  He asked me for my address to make sure.  I gave it to him again and he confirmed they had it.  I asked if my pizza was on the way.  He said it was.  20 minutes later, I get another call.  This time, yet a THIRD person, who again spoke almost no English, asked me for my address.  At this point, I was been frustrated, but again gave it to him, with difficulty.

Miraculously, 15 minutes later, the pizza showed up.  Unfortunately, it was definitely not hot, but still really good pizza.  I will just pick my pizza up from this place in the future. Users/JMattson

20130527 23:18:47 nbsp They have good pizza, I always buy a slice whenever Im in town. However dont buy with a credit or debit card if youre only buying a slice of pizza or any other small thing. Always pay with cash even if you have to walk ten blocks to the nearest atm.  Users/Adnil

20130528 06:32:19 nbsp Nvm, never coming here again.  Users/Adnil

20131026 22:29:29 nbsp Although this place is my favorite for ordering pizza; I have to agree with another reviewer about the credit card. First I picked up, paid in the store, and saw a credit card charge of $5 extra, took it up with the manager who was hard to get a hold of, and it was finally returned to my credit card a few days later. He wanted me to come in, stating he couldnt return it to my card which can be done, but since it wasnt my mistake I made them take care of it. Second time same thing happened but I just went to pick up the cash. Now tonight I order for delivery, they already added the delivery charge, I left the tip in cash, yet I look at my credit card online somebody charged me an extra $8. If they do not know how to enter a number or are trying to make extra money maybe they shouldnt take credit cards. If purchasing I would also avoid using your credit card or debit card, and strictly pay in cash. As good as their pizza is I will continue to buy it, however something shady is going on at this business. I cannot debate that their pizza and pastries are the best I have had for over a year, but I dont exactly trust the credit card stuff since this is the third incident in a few months, and never occurred before when I used cash. If you have to use a credit card please pay close attention to what they charge, by checking your credit charges, and keep the receipt as proof.
My advice: use cash, pickup is better than delivery, and try the veggie its the best.Users/Sean23

20131213 12:34:49 nbsp I love the food here but the last two times I ordered I was charged an additional dollar when using my credit card, ON TOP of the $0.50 fee they add for using one. I dont know if this is management policy or the employees trying to skim money (charging an extra buck then taking one from the register), but it is a huge turn off. The girl at the register wearing an SF hat was the one who rang me up both times.  Users/bordiga

20131215 18:26:05 nbsp I tried to resolve this with the owner but the manager has acted as a gate keeper between myself and the owner and would not put me in touch with him. My credit card was overcharged $6 on a order I picked up from the store. I did not tip the cashier as I walked in, paid her, and picked up my pizza. She acted a bit strange when I drew a line through the tip line and totaled my credit card slip with the base amount. It struck me odd enough that I kept my receipt to check against my online credit card activity the next day. I rarely save receipts. I checked the charge after it posted to my account and sure enough it was different than my receipt by $6. I called my credit card company and they gave me a credit and will handle it from there. We enjoy pizza from this location at least 10 time a month. I have dealt with the rude spanish speaking employees that take your order, bark a total, and hang up before I can confirm it with them. We always chaulked it up as part of the Village Bakery experience. This however will not be tolerated. If the manager would have just taken the time to help me with this, gave me a credit, and checked up with the employee who did it, I would have been satisfied. But now I wonder how many people fall prey to employees helping themselves to a tip knowing that most people wont catch it. Village Bakery has lost us as a customer forever and I will be putting this out on social media and our food blog in the coming days. Bad move guys.... Users/MikeGee
