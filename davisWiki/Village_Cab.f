Village Cab is one of the modes of transportation in town for those who may find themselves out in the Davis Downtown scene at night without a designated driver, or just in need of a quick run to the market. Village Cab takes reservations for rides to Amtrak & even for a ride to and from a doctors appointment. They offer rides to airports and Gambling casinos in the area.  They also offer discounts to students, members of the military, AAA members, and AARP members.  Their blue and orange vans, and a Prius Hybrid, zip hither and fro, whisking people (and pets?) to various Navigating Davis destinations in Adventures outside of Davis and around Davis. Village Cab also gladly transports your pets as long as they are protected within a pet carrier!  Reservations are recommended if your pet has an appointment with a vet or pet groomer.
Village Cab leases its cabs to folks who know their way around the Davis Area; more than half of their cab leases are made with drivers who grew up in Davis, or have lived within the Davis City Limits for 20 years or more.

  Sacramento County Airport System  Registered as : Village Cab of Davis
  Yolo County Business License As of http://www.yolocounty.org/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid1538 Mar. 31, 2010 No License on record with Yolo County, possibly restricting transportation outside of Davis, if not within the Davis city Limits. Update:: as of September 19, 2011, today, by making a single call to the Yolo County ClerkRecorders Office to request info regarding
the necessity of obtaining a Yolo County Business License, one would discover that businesses are not in need of this license if they already have a business license on file for the incorporated City in which they are based. Business that have no base in an incorporated city within the County & who routinely do business in or solicit business in the Unincorporated Areas of the County need to obtain this Yolo County Business License from the Planning & Public Works Office.

However, without trying to make it seem as if this business is inadequately licensed, no ordinance has been pointed out that restricts a properly licensed transportation business from picking up customers within its base of operations (Davis) and dropping them off in areas of Yolo County. Neither has an ordinance or law been pointed out that requires any transportation company from picking up in Yolo County and returning back to the City where its license is in effect. Its actually a fact that Village Cab drivers and patrons drive out to Pacific Star Gardens on County Road 99 & Capay Valley Organic Farms on Highway 16 in Capay Valley and purchase Wonderful Heirloom Tomatoes and even BRING them BACK into the City of Davis for consumption!! The idea of loving local products and services and patronizing them as much as possible is imbued in Village Cab which is properly licensed and insured to drop off within 200 miles of Davis, its base of operations. Cheers !!

20051203 16:51:59 nbsp the guy who runs village cab is super nice, and they give student discounts Users/JennSuzuki

20060209 18:49:29 nbsp Village Cab is amazing! I was running completely late for my train out of town for the weekend and I was freaking out. I called several other cab companies, and none of them could pick me up or take a credit card, and Village Cab completely saved me. Even though the driver was already taking people down to the train station during peak Davis traffic, he came all the way back and got me to the train station just in time for me to get on my train. Without him, I wouldve missed my train and completely thrown off all my plans. From now on, Village Cab will be the first taxi service I call, every time! Users/HannahReff

20060619 01:53:32 nbsp Village Cab is awesome! Like Hannah, I was also running late. I had to catch the plane in an hour, and I just missed the bus because of heavy luggage. I told Village Cab it was an emergency and the driver got here in record time. He helped carry my luggage and got to the terminal as soon as possible. If it werent for Village Cab I would need to find an inn to stay. If anyone asks, I will most definitely recommend Village Cab. Thanks for the great service! Users/WengFF

20070110 12:50:34 nbsp Village Cab welcomes your Questions, Comments & Suggestions. Please email us at  feedback@villagecab.com. We thank you for your business in 2006 & we look forward to serving you in 2007! Users/DavidPlacencia

20070223 12:25:15 nbsp YEAH VILLAGE CABS!!!!! (if hear that shouted out when you see a village cab, thats me) I know the folks there, they run a good ship. Users/StevenDaubert

20071101 04:31:00 nbsp Thank You SOOOOO much Village Cab patrons!  Your great costumes & festive spirit made the night really fun! We enjoyed serving you during Halloween 2007 ! Your patience and understanding through the busier times made our night. See you next Halloween ! Users/DavidPlacencia

20080518 00:30:35 nbsp OVERCHARGES. As in, I hand him a 10 for a 6 dollar ride (from the Segundo Dorms to the Amtrak station), and he does not give me change unless I ask for it. Users/eda
  It is customary when presenting a ten dollar bill to pay for a ride (thats for less than the ten dollars) to say how much you would like back as change  Usually as you are handing the bill to the driver. However, sometimes communication gets crossed, missed, or not sent or received at all. It is unfortunate, EDA, that the exchange with the driver didnt go smoothly. Village Cab does thank you for your openness and your frankness. We also appreciate you calling our taxi service and hope we can meet your transportation needs in the future. Users/DavidPlacencia
  It is customary for the driver to return the change to the customer unless instructed otherwise. This was not a case of poor communication, it was a case of the driver acting very poorly. The driver should be instructed on how to correctly conduct a transaction. marty
   Are you at all familiar with a process called tipping? As in waiters, pizza delivery people, and taxi drivers customarily recieve tips. If you overpay slightly and do not request change, it is reasonable for a taxi driver to assume you are providing a small gratuity. Users/JodyNorthup

20080521 20:05:26 nbsp since when does village cab rock a camry? Users/StevenDaubert
    Where are you seeing a Camry? I see a Mercury Sable. Users/BrandonBarrette
     they have the sable, as well as a taurus, I saw the camry headed Northbound on B st yesterday around 18:20

20080522 15:10:44 nbsp ...It seems what eda and marty are hitting on falls within the subject of driver etiquette. Yes, it is fair to say that in a transaction of this kind change should be presented to the payer as swiftly as possible to avoid the appearance of dishonesty. I would ask if marty was actually there when this exchange took place, and if not, why so harsh a judgment? Is it at all possible there was a simple misunderstanding? How do you know the driver acted very poorly?...I definitely agree that absolutely noone should ever be shortchanged. But I also believe you can shortchange someones credibility by assigning premature judgement when they their performance falls short in an isolated instance. I stand firmly behind the honesty of Village Cab drivers as well as for the fairness and kindness of those thousands of customers we have served and hope to serve. We will make every effort to insure all of our patrons are served as safely and in as timely a manner as is expected. Please feel free to ask for me, David Placencia, if there is ever a comment of praise or comment of instruction or advice you would like to give. You can reach me at 530.753.8294. I will personally work to address any question of honesty or integrity that arises. It helps sometimes to first air these points out person to person rather than on an open stage; there can be details about an exchange that go unrevealed when there is no room allowed for personal dialog and understanding. Eda, we are sorry that your change was not given before you asked and we hope you can feel assured that this incident will make us a better business. Thank You again for your openness without which we could not improve.

20080528 17:16:39 nbsp I called the night before to arrange for an early morning pickup.  The driver was right on time, and cheerfully helped me with my very heavy luggage.  Clean car, nice driver, and on time.  Cant ask for more than that! Users/mphpnj

20080602 17:51:04 nbsp Village Cab is the best! I have always had amazing service with very courteous drivers I will continue to use you and recommend you guys to all my friends p.s. I usually tell them (the driver) to keep the change  especially on a short ride :) Users/marabella

20080827 12:02:40 nbsp Ive been calling Village Cab for three years and theyve always been prompt, professional and helpful. They have taken me to work, to run errands, to Sac, the airport, to the doctor, to the vet, to Dixon, Woodland, etc. They know the area inside out, the rates are fair, and its comforting to know they are metered and insured (I ASKED!). Users/missfoyle

20090224 01:52:16 nbsp In the past two weeks, I called Village Cab twice and asked them to pickup a family member in a nearby town and take that person to another area town.  Both times they were very courteous and understanding of the situation; I was called when they picked up the person and again when they arrived at the destination.  I live over 150 miles away and was able to use my credit card for the fare.  Village Cab is the best and I certainly recommend them to anyone who wants superior service in and around Davis.  Thank you Village Cab for your kindness.
 Users/NancyMc

20090605 09:53:00 nbsp Ive been calling Village Cab for almost a year now, and theyve never failed me once. From reservations to lastminute rides theyve always been extremely reliable, helpful, and courteous. Whats more, their excellent service remains consistent among the several drivers that they have. Village Cab definite gets my vote for the best cab service in town, and Ill be recommending it to anyone who asks about it in the future. Users/AnthonyLam

20091126 23:46:19 nbsp To All Of Our Drivers, Customers, and Friends: Thank You! YOU ALL MAKE VILLAGE CAB! Happy Thanksgiving & Happy 5th Anniversary 2009!!!! Users/DavidPlacencia

20100429 15:13:51 nbsp Max is rude, unprofessional, and on a power trip (no clue why).  All the other drivers at Village are friendly and provide really good service.  Users/JCL95616

20100429 15:46:16 nbsp I called them to order a cab for someone who had flown in to University Airport last weekend. The driver (over the phone) asked where the person needed to go, so I told him, and he said he would be here in 15 minutes. I hung up and the person went out to wait for the cab. Five minutes later the driver called me back and asked if the person still needed a ride. I found this extremely odd seeing as I had just talked to him 5 minutes prior, asking for him to come. Users/JenniferCook

20100430 05:00:33 nbsp Hi Jennifer, sorry for the confusion. That day during your Cal Aggie Flyers Open House
we had 2 drivers on schedule. After taking a reservation, I noticed your call (shows up as CalAggieFlyers on our call list) showed up as a missed call on my cellphone (our taxiline was forwarded to the cell phone system at the time since we were out on the road). I called my backup real quick to check if he answered your call, but I got his voicemail. So I called you back just to make sure you were being served not realizing the other driver had answered your forwarded call, quoted you an ETA and was quickly on his way!
...turned out my call back to you was unnecessary...forgive me for being overzealous.
Jennifer thank you for calling us from the University Airport, we always appreciate the chance to serve you! Users/DavidPlacencia

20100430 13:48:47 nbsp Thanks for the explanation, David. Not having that information at the time, I found it quite weird to get a call back just a few minutes later with a confirmation. Now I see the confusion on your end and understand that you were just being thorough. Thanks! Users/JenniferCook

20100509 14:50:46 nbsp ...ive seen max go out of his way to help people get in and around davis even if they werent getting a cab (ie finding
the right train or bus connection someplace)...and witnessed flashes of frustration get the best of him...pretty sure honestly he needs more time off...the village cab driver corps is more than capable of taking good care of customers while he takes a break...ummm think these guys deserve to be in the spotlight: Reinhard & Kiel & the newer ones Aaron, (Travis?)and longtime cabbie Josh...just a suggestion:) max! Users/verileemerchant95618

20100514 12:04:01 nbsp Just a note of information: Village Cab has several new 1$ off coupons available; ask your driver for one today!
Also, we neglected to print that coupons are only good 1 AT A TIME, not stackable. Sorry for any confusion! We Thank You For Your
Business! ( you can contact us now at villagecabdavis@gmail.com)  Users/DavidPlacencia
  Heh... whoops! Users/TomGarberson

20100816 10:26:45 nbsp Their service was great. My train was delayed, so they were able to track our progress and pick us up at a reasonable time. The driver was also very nice Users/Htom

20100923 13:45:37 nbsp The guy I called from New York for an airport return was friendly but never called me back, although he said he would.  I waited 18 hours and then called Checker.  What a difference!!! Users/thelmaleegross

20100923 15:12:52 nbsp Dear Ms. Gross, we always strive to return each and every phone call for service, but in your case we dropped the ball. I apologize for this lapse in our attention to your
call. We are glad that you were able to reach Checker Cab for service; it is a daily reality that both our companies refer to one another to help cover demands for service; believe me, none of us are perfect. One of the central reasons I choose to do business in Davis is that when it comes right down to it, we all lean on each other when time and business demands require us to and back each other to help provide transportation for those who live in and visit our community. We are very hard working and earnest in this endeavor. As manager and operator of Village Cab I have personally, over the past 56 years, covered calls for EVERY cab company in Davis, and will continue to do so. I have made some mistakes and have helped cover others mistakes. We are all indepedent cab companies but are united in our basic sense of goodwill and determination to serve. Some of us do some things much better than others on any given day. So, I am still very proud to work for Village Cab and at the same time I apologize for not getting back to you in regards to your trip back from the Big Apple. I am hopeful that time & circumstance will allow us the opportunity to serve you in the future and give us the chance to show you our true willingness to provide the absolute best transportation experience. I would like to say in closing, that it is quite unfortunate that so much of the commentary in this wikitype medium can tend to lend itself toward polarizing one service against or for another; I say this in  response to your comment, Ms. Gross, on the Checker wiki regarding the fact that Davis Cab referred you to us when you called; as mentioned above, it is important that folks who read these comments in relation to using local cab services in our wonderful city of Davis, realize that we in reality work very much in TANDEM to help each other fulfill our
promises to customers. Beleive it or not, many good things we all do never make it to these pages, and it may
go against the idea of competitive advantage to also admit that we local cabs cooperate much more than many might want to beleive or expect,
but it is above all important to have a realistic point of view before casting dispersion.
Sincerely Yours, David Max Placencia

20110317 02:02:39 nbsp Does the Village Cab take plastic? I had a good experience but the guy said if we didnt have any cash on us hed have to take us to the ATM? Just curious if theyre cash only or if the guy was being an ass. Users/rrenati
  Some their cabs are able to accept debit and/or charge cards, but to my knowledge it has not been installed in all their vehicles. A good way to avoid this problem with any cab is to mention your payment method in advance. Most will not have any problems with you using your card since they automatically get a gratuity when you use it from what I have heard.  Users/WesP

20110317 05:51:20 nbsp Dear RRenati, we do take plastic. Sorry for the misconception. Theres been a
small but gradual increase in declined or maxout credit cards, and we drivers have started offering
more often to stop at an ATM but in most cases only if it is not more than a few blocks out of the
way. We drivers will stop the meter while you get your cash.
We are most definitely however most keen on having you be satisfied about your entire taxicab experience.
We will also double our efforts to ensure we carry extra paperrolls and battery supplies for our wireless terminals
to help make sure they are always capable of completing a desired transaction. We hope that your experience will not
prevent you from travelling across Davis in one of our taxicabs in the future.  Users/DavidPlacencia

20110322 12:04:06 nbsp Within the past week, Village Cab  has received a letter from an observer who reports that she saw 2 things. First, at about midnight 3 weeks ago while a fare was being dropped off outside her window, a couple of people talking loudly passed her window and attracted her attention. She looked out and watched as a cab driver and a woman were talking. The woman was fumbling through her open purse (she appeared to the observer to be drunk) and they were seemingly discussing payment for the ride. She says she heard part but not all of their conversation. A comment from the lady was heard, what amounted to  go ahead and do whatever you want !  Subsequently a cabin light went dark, seemingly turned out by the driver. Second, the observer states she saw the cab driver touch the womans chest. After a moment the woman turned the light on, smiled, gathered her purse and left the cab. Finally, the observer believed she saw that the driver looked like he felt guilty about what just transpired. No specific day or place of occurrence was given for this story, and Village Cab is inquiring into the matter. Village Cab believes its crucial the public knows Village Cab does not condone any kind of inappropriate touchforfare or any other payment/trade for fare except cash or credit card (credit card for payments at $7 or greater) and takes an observation like this seriously. Although the entire truth isnt known about the exchange, Village Cab is sensitive to making sure our female ridership, as well as male ridership, is transported safely. Village Cab is taking preemptive steps to place cameras in our cabs before the fiscal year is out to help aid in security for our ridership as well as our drivers. We appreciate you taking the time to read this. Any comments or questions in regard to this or any other topic of concern please feel free to email villagecabdavis@gmail.com 24 hours a day. We do not have all the specifics at this time and our observer has not as yet furnished them, but we appreciate that she had taken the time to tell us what she observed, and are most urgently concerned and
conducting an inquiry. Sincerely, Users/DavidPlacencia
