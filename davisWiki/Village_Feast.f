The Village Feast is the annual major end of the summer fundraiser for the Davis Farm to School Programs. Monies support nutrition services by supporting efforts to secure local, fresh produce for school lunches, second grade farm visits, school garden matching grants, and recycle programs and environmental education for the fourteen schools in the Davis Joint Unified School District.

In accordance to the http://www.davisfarmtoschool.org/ Davis Farm to School philosophy, all produce and meat are sourced in Yolo County. The meal is held under the big Sycamore Trees in Central Park very close to where the famous Davis Farmers Market is located. The meal is prepared and catered by http://buckhorncatering.com/ Buckhorn Catering of Winters. Wines are sourced from the outstanding Yolo County Wines. To practice “zero waste”, all attendees bring their own table service and cloth napkins, but wine glasses are provided.

This year, Davis Farm to School is holding their 8th annual Village Feast at noon to 3 P.M. on Saturday, August 25, 2012 at Central Park in Davis.
