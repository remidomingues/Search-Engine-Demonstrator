Village Harvest is a nonprofit volunteer opportunities volunteer organization in the greater San Francisco Bay Area which harvests fruit trees fruit from backyards and small orchards, then passes it along to local food agencies to feed the hungry.  This organization also provides education on fruit tree care, harvesting, and food preservation.
Since its founding in 2001, Village Harvest has grown to be one of the oldest and largest organizations of this kind in the country, harvesting a total of 2 Million servings of nutritious fresh fruit for the community. (Text adapted from http://villageharvest.org)

Village Harvest in Davis
In 2009, Joe and Linda Schwartz and Greg and Pam Gibbs started a Davis Team of Village Harvest  that harvests fruit in the Davis area and donates it to local food agencies such as STEAC. The Davis Team donated 10951 pounds of nutritious fruit in 2009, 26,669 pounds in 2010, and over 42,968 pounds in 2011.

How to get involved
Volunteer harvesters can sign up via an http://villageharvest.org/volunteerform.htm online form on the main Village Harvest website to receive email announcements of upcoming harvests. Volunteers are welcome to help with fruit tree harvests on a onetime basis or at as many harvest events as they like.  Harvests typically take place on weekends or Tuesday mornings in Davis and last 23 hours.  No experience is necessary.  Harvesters meet at a central location and carpool to the harvest site.  Bikes are welcome, and the organization is always in need of people with trucks or vehicle space to help transport the fruit and equipment.

Village Harvest encourages tree owners to harvest and donate fruit they cannot use themselves, but if you are unable to do this, Village Harvest can schedule a harvest at your house.  You can sign up using the http://villageharvest.org/homeform.htm online form for tree owners or by phone. See the http://villageharvest.org main organization website for more information.

Donating equipment
The right equipment helps volunteers get fruit from trees to food agencies.  Please contact Joe Schwartz joe.schwartz@villageharvest.org if you would like to donate any of the following:
 plastic milk crates or similarlysized washable containers (for transporting fruit)
 orchard ladder
 pole fruit harvesters

Collaboration with the Gleaning Project
In 2009 and 2010 Village Harvest collaborated with members of The Gleaning Project, a UC Davis student organization with a similar mission.  The Gleaning Project is no longer active. Many UCD students continue to volunteer as gleaners with Village Harvest.

20100402 17:33:58 nbsp Were sorry you couldnt join us for the 21310 harvest.  Harvesters leave the meeting place promptly just after the start time, so please be punctual.  Also, if possible, we prefer volunteers to sign up online ahead of time and rsvp for specific harvests. This helps us plan more effective harvests.  Please come out for future harvests!  More harvests will soon be posted on the calendar at www.villageharvest.org/davis  Users/dylancooke
