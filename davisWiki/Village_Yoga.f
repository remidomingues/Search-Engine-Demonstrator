20101018 17:23:14 nbsp Lindas class is one of the best yoga classes I have been to.  She opens and closes with a beautiful prayer bringing the true spiritual essence to the class and uses breathing techniques to warm the body and starts off gently moving through posses. the class is always a little different, she adjust each pose to the level of each student with personal attention. she makes sure all student are in the pose properly to best of their ability and each student is challenged appropriately. Her soothing voice brings the spiritual element as well a playfulness that lightens the mood. I feel amazing for days after her class. I strongly recommend it! And the first one is free so theres nothing to loose:) Users/TanyaLawrence

20120320 14:12:18 nbsp I have been doing prenatal yoga here for almost 4 months and I love it. I leave class feeling great and it has been invaluable for helping my body through the pregnancy. My ligament pain has been reduced and I am very flexible as a result of these classes. Linda specifically addresses the common problem of sciatica during pregnancy and I am grateful that I have not had to endure this painful condition, most likely due to regularly attending class. Linda is kind, authentic, knowledgable and encouraging.  Users/Kristin

20120616 13:16:55 nbsp I highly recommend Lindas prenatal yoga classes.  I started going my 27th week of pregnancy and immediately wished I had started earlier.  I continued going every week through my 40th week of pregnancy and I always, always felt better physically and mentally after going to class.  Her classes are positive, relaxing, and empowering.  My body is in much better condition even though the yoga felt so gentle.  Linda, herself, is a totally awesome, warm, caring, and super helpful individual.  She also has some rad tiedye.

20120910 20:44:52 nbsp I started taking private lessons with Linda at the end of April 2012, about 5 months ago. I am overweight, sedentary, and it was after I had a back episode that put me in bed and made me miss 7 work days that I decided I needed help. I found Linda through the Davis wiki and I think it is time to share my experience with the community. We typically meet 3 times a week for 1.5 h lessons. Each class starts and ends with a relaxation and she adjusts each pose/exercise to fit my body and my needs. It is incredible how her small adjustments make such a big difference. Linda seems to know my body more than I do and has shown me many muscles I didnt even know I had! A lot has changed in these last five months and I feel much stronger and healthier. I am enjoying exercise for the first time in my life and have even started swimming and going to the gym! I feel like a new person and Linda was instrumental to this change. She is patient, knowlageble,  professional, and fun. I am now finally ready to join her regular class, but I will continue to pay for the private classes because I know they are worth every penny. I cant recommend her highly enough!!!  Users/VeraMargoniner
