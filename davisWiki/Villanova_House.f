20090816 20:58:02 nbsp hey, how do i get in contact with someone if we want to play a show here? We are a folk band and are going on tour in midSeptember.  Here is our myspace and email, please get in contact!  Ill love you.  www.myspace.com/awkwardstarfishband ///// awkwardstarfish@yahoo.com Users/awkwardstarfish

20090816 23:12:42 nbsp I think the name of the website listed here is repulsive, Ive been to a show here before but I would try to avoid that website. Users/NickSchmalenberger
  I dont see whats so repulsive about the name of the website. Its not listed in urban dictionary so it obviously doesnt mean anything beyond what youve interpreted it to mean. And why would you suggest avoiding the website? Its an outstanding resource for finding local shows. Users/jsogul jo

20090818 00:57:43 nbsp Yeah, OK, but the house is in a very residential area, and the occasional exceptions when shows go past 10 are a little too frequent.  If they could make sure the windows stay closed, and the volume stays reasonable, theyd make better neighbors. Users/DanLawyer

20090906 19:13:02 nbsp Hey Dan, we apologize that the shows going past 10pm bothered you. That wasnt our intention. We set that rule to reduce the impact we have on our neighbors. We really do care about the area and will strive even harder to make sure that noise is done by 10pm and well close the windows to dampen the sound exiting the house. Please feel free to stop by and talk to us about any concerns you have about shows or otherwise. You and Naomi are more than welcome to come and enjoy the shows and we appreciate your comment. You can also contact us directly at deependdriver@gmail.com
