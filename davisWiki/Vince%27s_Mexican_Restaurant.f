I find it a funny thing to have grown up in a small sleepy town not really known for much except that the surrounding areas yield a diverse variety of crops to canneries around the area and complain about the lack of decent restaurants.

So saying, the one place our family always to for some decent Mexican food, was Vinces, a family owned restaurant located right on the Main St. strip.  Now, granted Ive been spoiled by the massive burritos in wiki:sf:the Mission, but driving by this little joint brings a warm wash of nostalgia over me every time.

The menu is simple:  appetizers, entrees, and combination plates.  My favorite is the chicken enchilada plate with a side of their refried beans and fried rice and a small green salad that has the best ranch dressing Ive ever had that they make from scratch.  Plate is under $7.

Cheap, good, and quick service, has left a fond place in my memories of this little place.
