Welcome to the Wiki!  What makes you say that University Covenant Church is only in it for the money?  While I havent been a huge number of times, that hasnt been my experience. Users/TomGarberson

20110418 20:15:06 nbsp Thanks for the invite. I am not a jazz type of guy. But who knows, I might check it out. As for UCC, I dont really wish to discuss UCC. I posted what I did in hopes of helping others not to bash UCC or Catalyst. I have nothing against them and wish them the best, but in my situation they were not at their best. I really just want to move forward. I have still kept y faith and I hope youre open to church in the future as well. Users/Dozer

20110608 18:48:40 nbsp Hey thanks man, I will keep my head up. I saw what you wrote on Catalyst. I appreciate the back up, I truly do. It is nice to finally have some peeps in Davis. But I think there is an aggression issue here. We need to make sure that we keep a level of maturity, this way people know that our head is in the right place. Like my confusion over Landon speaking about wanting to meet and only talking in private,yet he wont respond to my email where I invited him to my house. So name calling isnt good, lets face it Christians arguing with Christians is nasty enough as it is. Thanks again.

P.S. I am leaving in 2 weeks. Users/Dozer
