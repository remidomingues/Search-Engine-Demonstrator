Vinecology is a fairly new group at UC Davis composed of students, professors, professionals, scientists and friends who work on promoting and learning about sustainable vineyard production.  They take field trips, invite speakers to campus and manage a small organic vineyard at the student farm on campus. From time to time they hold wine tastings where they enjoy the wonders of fine wine while also educating folks about the sustainable practices of the producers.  They have an interactive website and hold meetings weekly.
