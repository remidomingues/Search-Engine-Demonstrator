20060420 13:11:31 nbsp Ah, I see.  Have Nick remove his stupid comment and Ill be happy to remove mine.  Unless, that is, you prefer him ranting on and on about how the Africans dont need water and we need to take care of the water epidemic in California.  Right. Users/PhellanKell
   I didnt ask you (whom I assume is just a clone ov VishadDewan) to remove your comments, just your comment spam. Users/DavidReid

20060420 13:39:40 nbsp Vishad  Please do not spam entries.  I removed the threads (the bulk of which were my comments) because they were no longer on topic for the entry.  Feel free to move them here to your personal page.  Please also try to keep the personal attacks to a minimum.  Debating someones ideas is fine; attacking their person or spewing random comments is not. Users/JabberWokky
