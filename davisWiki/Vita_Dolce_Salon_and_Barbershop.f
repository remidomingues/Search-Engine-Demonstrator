Vita Dolce Salon was a local Hair Salons and Barber Shops salon that aimed to please both men and women by offering a full range of services, such as hair design, massage, and nail care. Their highly trained and personable staff spent many years here in Davis. The owners, Antainette and Carlos, combined skills and passion to create a stylish, urban salon dedicated to both men and women. The salon had a classic style with a modern twist.

Hannah and Antainette are now at Strands Salon.  Kristin Hernandez is now at Wilde Hare Salon in Dixon.

Their services included:
	 Full Service Hair Salon Color/Highlights, cuts, updo’s, etc
               Now offering both Cadiveu and Pravana smoothing treatments (FORMALDEHYDE FREE)
	 Massages deep tissue, Swedish, etc


Vita Dolce Salon was located in the heart of downtown Davis, directly across from the AT&T store. This historic building was once a bank, but was been transformed into a trendy full service salon.  The renovations to the building incorporated modern themes, bright colors and blue accents, while maintaining a classic touch with damask designs and black furniture. When you entered, you were greeted in the lobby and escorted to where you would receive your services. The massage therapist was located in a secluded and peaceful room within the Salon, and the hair stations were located to the right of the lobby.

Vita Dolce offered their clients two lines of professional products, Unite and Davines, both emphasizing their use of all natural ingredients.

I never have to wait and I always get her full attention.  No squeezing others in during my appointment like Ive had happen at other salons.  My color always looks awesome and I always leave happy!  This is definitely a place you need to check out!!     Users/shylia

The one thing about this place, is that you can really tell that everyone that works there wants to be there and make you feel great, even with the drink bar, and all!

20090618 18:50:53 nbsp Vita Dolce  Sick!!  Ive been to multiple salon and barber shops and this is by far the nicest, most welcoming and visually pleasing location I’ve seen.  From the moment you walk in you get a very warm and calming feeling with the blue all around you… Now for me I went to get a fade with a trim on top, and I don’t know why, but most places it’s either they are experts at fades and tapers but can’t cut hair free style or vise versa.   However, at Vita Dolce doesn’t matter what style of cut you need Mike P / Mr. Hollywood will take care of ya.  Sitting down in the chill barbershop room  with a huge flat screen TV and talking it up Hollywood about what ever, will feel relax and confident that you’re in the hands of the best hair stylist in Davis!  When he was done with my fade and trim, with minimal instructions by me, I was hella stocked because it was the cleanest cut I had in years.  Perfect fade and Perfect trim… that dude so good he should be called ‘Mike of All Trades’! For real’s!! Hit them up you won’t regret it. Users/KINGJES

20090618 21:43:01 nbsp Vita Dolce is the only place I will be going from now on... Thank goodness we have some serious talent in Davis. I went in for a cut from Alyssa, and got exactly what I wanted. I asked for a lob, and I had brought a picture. A lob is a long bob, and after she was finished I was so happy at how good it turned out! Not surprised at all, Alyssa seriously has what it takes. Antainette, was also very nice, and funny, it was like I was hanging out with my girlfriends. They made sure my time there was great, cold bottled water, or soda, or even wine. They also got me hooked on the product they carry, Davines. Defineatly worth every penny. I had asked Alyssa about each product, because I needed specific things to control color, and frizz and stuff like that, and she knew exactly what I needed; My hair has really never felt this good. This place is countless steps ahead of the rest!!! And the pedicures arent bad either... hehe......Just a down right awesome salon, from style and design, to just shear talent (no pun intended ;)  Users/SofiaR

20090618 22:02:27 nbsp Alyssa at Vita Dolce has been cutting my hair for a couple years now and I LOVE the way she does my hair!  She always dedicates her full attention to me during my appointment, ensuring wonderful results each and every visit.  Prior to meeting Alyssa, I had been flying to LA to get my hair cut because I couldnt find a local pro.  I was convinced by a friend to try Alyssa and I havent been back to LA since! Simply put, Alyssa knows her stuff: she is professional, stylish, and extremely talented.  In addition to all this Alyssa has a cheerful, fun personality and I always leave looking and feeling GREAT!   (A+ Alyssa!) Users/angcastle

20090619 15:23:13 nbsp Why look anywhere else to get cut? My boy Mike at Vita Dolce does it official. Real talent and passion is hard to find these days but Mike knows how to treat you right. just tell him exactly what you want and you will not leave disappointed. you really dont know what a real haircut looks like unless you been to Mike. Ive known him for well over a year and hes been up and down california cutting hair and learning fresh new techniques and styles. he just got back from Orange County after a successful stay and hes ready to give you the cleanest, most eye catching haircut uve ever had. the time and detail he puts into his cuts is second to none. barbers like Mike are few and far between, let him prove to you that haircuts can be fun as well as rewarding. your friends and family will notice a difference. Mikes cuts will give you the swagger you need to be that go getter you always wanted to be... Users/AnthonyConrad

20090619 18:43:35 nbsp Vita Dolce is where its at! Dont let the name fool you because there is a REAL BARBER SHOP that is seperate from the salon in the back. I live in Vacaville and used to go to get a fade in Dixon by Mike Preciado (aka Hollywood) or Carlos Preciado even though there are barber shops in Vacaville. Now that they are in Davis I travel even further to get faded up. Not only are they the best barbers but they are also really cool people and treat all of their customers as friends. They make you want to hang so if you have to wait you dont realize that you are waiting. Even after my hair cuts are done I always stick around if I have time to. My haircut is always clean and just the way I want it. I dont even have to tell them what I want because they already know. Mike was barbering in L.A. for a while and when I went out there for vacation I made a point to stop at his barber shop for a Mike P Special (the cleanest fade I have ever have in my life). I always refer my friends to Mike and the ones who decide to try him out are more than satisfied. I also love the fact that at Vita Dolce it is a Salon & Barber Shop because I can bring my girlfriend with me to get her hair or nails done while I get my fade... make sure to stop by one day and at least look at it (also meet the crew) even if you are not sure about getting a service done. Users/brhodes707

20090619 19:08:14 nbsp What up Mike P. Thanks for the birthday love and the sexy fade homie. I was hella stressing hitting Napa for my birthday weekend with my lady after my last Davis cut. You really took the time to hook it up, get all the small things other barbers fail to notice, and make it look pimp. My whole headpiece is like whoa. Youre a helluva barber and Im glad we finally got someone in town that can cut it up like back home in LA. Much love.  Users/Johnathen

20090623 13:13:14 nbsp Vita Dolce is the most professional and stylish new salon in Davis. Antainette and Alyssa have done an amazing job decorating the salon part of Vita Dolce and everytime I go in, I have a great experience. Alyssa has been my stylist for about a year now, and she is literally the best stylist I have ever had. She successfully transitioned me from brunette to blonde without making me look ridiculous and I always leave the salon satisfied. People are constantly asking me where I get my hair done. I have referred over 10 of my sorority sisters and friends to Alyssa, and everyone has become a repeat customer! If you are looking for a professional, relaxing, reasonable priced and stylish salon with dependable stylists who have a lot of experience and know what they are doing, Vita Dolce is definitely the place to go.  Users/MRS

20090720 14:03:43 nbsp I just had my first hair cut at Vita Dolce by Mike the week before. I went in without knowing what to expect except for all these previous posting. Fortunately, the previous postings werent lies. I just went in and allowed Mike to cut as he deemed necessary. While getting my hair chopped, Mike and I talked about a great assortment of topics. When the job was done, I had the cut I wanted. Furthermore, I did not have any cash with me; but, Mike allowed me to head over to my bank and get some money. Talk about trust! Overall, I highly recommend this place; the place feels like getting a haircut at home but with the professional skill level. Users/MrHer

20090728 15:04:14 nbsp So basically im here talking about Mr. Mike Peezy AKA Hollywood. Dis dude is sick !!!!. His cuts r so clean. I havent had a good barber ina long minute. Even doe I like new looks all the time, I feel Mike knows wats best. Ppl be jockin my cuts all the time. Haha. Go to him for fades, tappers, fohawks, mohawks or anything else u wann. He is a beast at the cuts.  Users/BigJoe

20090817 15:04:17 nbsp I got my hair cut here by Alyssa a few months ago, and it was the best cut Ive ever had. She is a perfectionist! My hair looked great when I left the salon. She understood my hair type, and she was able to cut a style that was not only adorable, but fit into my daily hair styling regime easily. Not only is she an excellent stylist, but shes extremely sweet and very fun to chat with while she works. I would highly recommend her to anyone looking for a new stylist. Users/ElizabethAbinante

20090901 15:45:43 nbsp Dont let the entrance fool you gentlemen.  Step inside, turn left and, Carlos, the best barber in Davis is waiting for you in a traditional mens barber shop complete with big screen TV.  No kidding  the best haircut ever. Users/JoeODonnell

20090904 13:33:07 nbsp Vita dolce is the best place to get ur haircut. Mike P gives the best fades and and haircuts. I drive all the way to vita dolce from dixon just to get a cut.  Users/jed

20090922 14:25:36 nbsp Carlos has been cutting my hair for a couple of years. I started going to Carlos when he was in Dixon. Im glad I found him, because its so hard to find a good/ traditional barber nowadays. I dont mind the extra drive to Davis, because I know Im always going to get a good haircut, and friendly and professional service. During my visit to Vita Dolce, I took advantage of a massage with Marissa. She did an awesome job on my sore and tight muscles. At Vita Dolce, you get it all. I highly recommend Vita Dolce to anyone, you wont be dissatisfied!!!! Dont forget to take advantage of their first time discounts... Users/italomartin

20091015 16:36:26 nbsp This is definitely the best barbershop in Davis. It took me a year but I finally found a place that can give a good fade. Also, love that they use the straight razors. Users/MarkD

20091114 14:48:54 nbsp Alyssa is great!  She just gave me a great cut today and Ive been going to her for about a year now.  Sadly I will only get to see her once more before I graduate and move away from Davis...but she is the best! :) Definitely an awesome, professional, clean and stylish salon.  Users/plaidisrad

20091119 09:23:25 nbsp Love this salon! It has a great vibe and the place is so clean! I been getting my hair done by Hannah Silici for about 4 years, following her around where ever she goes. She does the best color and cuts ever! Im so happy to see her in the new location! Thanks so much Hannah for the best hair ever! P.s they have a Barbershop to in the back.  Users/Sarahplainandtall

20091212 18:38:40 nbsp AMAZING! When I found out Maria was no longer at Lasting Impressions I panicked and after calling like 4 different salons I thought I was never going to find someone but then I called Vita Dolce and got an appt with Kristin...best service in a long time. My hair looks and feels great. I love this place!  Users/Tiffee

20091217 12:49:35 nbsp This is a TOP NOTCH Barbershop. The best in my opinion. I was very impressed with my barber Carlos in all aspects, ranging from his great care and personability to his knowledge and experience. I am very pleased with the seamless taper and am very glad to have tried his suggestions. Will be going back for sure.  Users/Alex

20091218 02:05:35 nbsp The fact is that Davis isnt a great town for barber shops: after being here a year and a half, Ive tried most of them. Got tired of being condescendingly (and incorrectly) lectured to about the financial crisis while getting substandard haircuts by one musclebound brother, got tired of unpredictable results at a few other places. After four haircuts  nothing fancy, straightup barbering  with both Carlos and Mike I have to say Im now loyal to the shop. They still use the straightrazor on the neck, still use oldschool aftershave, still know how to do a real taper, their first question isnt What number clipper? (yeah, scissors are still the primary instrument) and they still know how to talk with you  not at you  while youre getting a cut. Its called a barber shop, and many other establishments could take some lessons from them.   Users/Swilltopower

20100112 11:05:34 nbsp Friendly people in the barbershop.  Very poor haircut: uneven and patches.  Layering of hair poorly done. Shop is not clean. Not recommended.  Sorry. Users/willygates

20100121 19:23:15 nbsp Love Vita Dolce! Theyre simply the best, staff is amazing. Kristin does my hair religiously and its always the greatest experience. Definitely recommend to anyone who wants get their primp on all around! Two thumbs up, best and most fun salon Ive been to! Users/RhiRhi

20100130 15:31:29 nbsp Love Love Love Vita Dolce...... 1st time there for Me and My 6yr old. Kristin Hernandez was Wonderful! As soon as we walked in the door we were greeted and asked if we needed anything. We were then given a tour and off to have our hair done. I got a cut and Highlights, which came out beautiful. Everyone there was very sweet and we will be retuning very soon, but this time we will be bringing another fan may 8 yr old son since they have a Barber.... Its the 1 stop shop! Thanks so much..... Your Vacaville Friends dont mind driving to Davis for a Great Cut or Color!  Users/ENEDINA

20100210 21:34:25 nbsp Graduated from Davis last summer and relocated in South bay. The only reason Im visiting Davis is have my haircut with Alyssa. Alyssa has been doing my hair for two years now! :) She knows exactly what she is doing, love how she layering my hair!  Users/2250402

20100329 16:17:03 nbsp Kristen Hernandez is an extremely talented stylist who is employed at Vita Dolce.  I hired her to do my hair & makeup for a private event where I worked as Marilyn Monroe.  Her skills, knowledge & confidence in her ability & vision completely exceeded my expectations & blew everyones mind!  She made my night one I will always remember.  She was punctual & brought all of her own topoftheline products & was very generous with her pricing.  She was quick but spared nothing.  I will definitely hire Kristen Hernandez for my next special event!  Check her out folks~She ROCKS!  Users/EmFarrington

20100329 20:47:26 nbsp Kristin is definitely my go to girl for hair now.  Several things I love about her.  She listens to what I want, she pays attention to the texture and health of my hair when considering a cut, and she always gets great results.  I get nonstop compliments on my cut and color and I know it is all thanks to her skill.  Users/laurenswim

20100420 08:38:53 nbsp This place gave me the worst hair cut I have EVER had(Alyssa)! I went home and cried for hours!!!!
My hair was soo uneven and she cut my bangs so short! I am so angry!  Users/JessicaMorgan

20100426 16:01:22 nbsp Carlos was a great barber in the back, very good to talk to about sports and made sure that you oversaw your haircut throughout the process.  Definitely gonna go again. Users/pbdeng

Anyone who says anthing negative about her or her style know nothing about her because I give her an absolute A+! Keep up the great work alyssa!  Users/Tatertotz

20100519 18:41:58 nbsp Kristen is WONDERFUL! Ive tried a few other places in Davis (and elsewhere) but never went back to any one place because I never felt like I was never getting my moneys worth.  Now, I finally have a stylist I will go to again and again.  Kristen never rushes, always asks what you liked and didnt like about your last hair cut, and never gets annoyed when I ask her to fix something Im not happy with.  She definitely spends more time on my hair than anyone Ive ever gone to in the past.
When I did my hair after my latest haircut I realized that it wasnt quite what I wanted (my own fault for not describing what I wanted correctly).  I felt really bad asking Kristen to fix it a couple days later, but she was SO nice about it! She really took her time and made sure I left with exactly what I wanted.  She genuinely wants you to LOVE your haircut. :)
Since Ive started going to Kristen my hair looks better than EVER. Not to brag...but I look amazing! :) Thanks Kristen!
 Users/Katelyn

20100724 13:17:04 nbsp I just saw Kristin for a Brazillian Blowout that they just began offering.  My hair is natuarally curly and coarse with a lot of volume and frizz.  It is also very highlighted at a moment so I was concerned about overprocessing my hair.  Well Im amazed  Kristin really took her time with the process making sure that the heavily highlighted portions of my hair were not becoming too damaged or stressed. She also did a ton of research on which product would be best to use and was sure to find one that was free of Formaldehyde so that we wouldnt be breathing toxic fumes during the treatment.  The we didnt take all of the curl out of my hair so Im left with awesome beachy waves that are very managable.  The frizz is entirely gone and the shine that has been added to my hair is amazing.  I cannot wait to see how much more easily I can style my hair.  Im totally impressed by the service and would recommend it to anyone who just wants to make their hair more shiney and healthy looking and easier to deal with.  And definitely see Kristin to do it...you wont be disappointed. Users/laurenswim

20100827 17:14:15 nbsp Antainette just gave me the most beautiful ICE Blonde, peekaboo in my fringe! She safely and delicately lifted through Pravana Red/Magenta, with confidence. For those of you who dont know, Pravana is a very hard red to lift through and NEVER, in 15 years, has anyone pulled me this blonde. Though it is a small Section of hair, I am still wicked impressed :) From one color specialist to another, Antainette, YOU ROCK! Xoxo Users/KristinAprilHernandez

She is a very talented hair cutter, colorist and does an amazing BRAZILLIAN BLOW OUT! I know, what the heck is a Brazillian Blowout? Well, I have always had really curly frizzy hair and Hannah used a new nonabrasive chemical treatment made of all these natural products and ingredients and my hair has done a 108 degree turn around. It is silky smooth and STRAIGHT go figure. She also does an amazing job with color and highlights always, I mean always looks natural and exactly what I imagined. Check out Hannah! Users/Barley123
