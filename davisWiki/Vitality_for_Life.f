20080217 21:06:21 nbsp Pam Wilson is the most nurturing massage therapist I have ever been to.  Not only does she give great massages, she is a treasure chest of knowledge regarding food, herbs and aromas for health and healing.  Whenever I have midterms or finals, I go to her so I can destress and release anxiety and I do better on my tests!  She has help me with relationships as well as weight control.  It is just so nice to have finally found a massage therapist (that I trust whole heartedly) to nurture both my body and soul. Users/TeenaStockert

20080524 19:40:41 nbsp I went to Pam after finding a $35 coupon for 1 hour. I think she did a great job especially considering how inexpensive it was. The massage was relaxing and the lotion she used smelled great. I would have liked it if she had pressed a little harder but I guess that is my fault for not asking. Users/littlelemur

20090201 18:05:00 nbsp I went to Pam after a particularly stressful week of school and she was lovely. She is really sweet and supportive interested in making you feel better. I went in thinking that I would like an hour of quiet time, but we had a nice conversation and she was really good at listening to me  I vented a little :). She gave me some pointers for better posture and stretching that have helped! She was happy to share her knowledge of aromatherapy and nutrition, but unlike other people who use alternative methods, was not pushy at all. Like the comment above, I would also have liked if she had pressed harder, but I think it is my responsibility to ask that, and I didnt. I felt very relaxed when I left. Users/Ratatat
