wiki:wikipedia:Viticulture Viticulture is the study of grapes, and wiki:wikipedia:Oenology enology is the study of Making Wine winemaking.  The two make up the Viticulture and Enology department, which is one of the many Majors majors available at UCD. The department of http://wineserver.ucdavis.edu/ Viticulture and Enology is currently chaired by Andrew Waterhouse. Courses in winemaking were first offered by the viticulture department in 1935. In the summer of 2008, the department moved to the new Robert Mondavi Institute for Wine and Food Science much to the joy of its cramped faculty who were thrilled to leave Wickson Hall.

However, the new location does come with a few drawbacks:  The remote location on the southern edge of  Campus increases the travel time between classes, making punctuality nearly impossible for students on foot.  Also, the new building lacks Food of any sort, and has yet to receive daily circulation from The California Aggie.

Other notable faculty:
  Ann Noble
  Hildegarde Heymann

 Classes 

  VEN 2 Introduction to Viticulture. Covers the biology of grapes and how they are grown.  Offered every fall, taught by Larry Williams.  Probably more work than a 2 unit class should be.

  VEN 3  Introduction to Winemaking. A general education class aimed at nonmajors. The course covers (in no particular order) the history of wine, wine production, grape growing, health effects of wine, geography of grapegrowing regions, and wine evaluation. It gives either social science or science/engineering general education credit  3 units.  Taught by Hildegarde Heymann during Fall Quarter, and either Andrew Waterhouse or Doug Adams during the Winter and Spring Quarters.

  VEN 101  Viticultural Practices. A three part series.

  VEN 110  Vine physiology.  3 units, taught by Mark Matthews.

  VEN 115  Table and Raisin Grape Production.  This course relates to table grapes and raisins in name only, as it has more to do with vine physiology and deficit irrigation.  Fall Quarter only, taught by Larry Williams, 2 units.

  VEN 118  Vine Pests and Diseases.  Larry Williams divides the material so that one half of the course is only about vine pests, and the other about vine diseases.  The order is usually switched every year, and the final exam is not cumulative.  Be prepared for frequent guest lecturers.  3 units.

  VEN 123/123L  Analysis of Musts and Wines.  The lab and lecture are technically independent courses, but the material is very closely related, 2 units each.  Fall quarter only, taught by Sue Ebeler. Massive lab reports due weekly.

  VEN 124/124L  Wine Production.  Again, lab and lecture are separated, but there is less overlap than VEN 123/123L.  The lecture is 2 units, but the lab is 3.  Also fall quarter only, taught by Linda Bisson.  Quarterly work is somewhat back loaded, but still rather substantial.

  VEN 125/125L  Wine Types and Sensory Evaluation.  2 units each, taught by Hildegarde Heymann.

  VEN 126/126L  Wine Stability.  3 unit lecture, 2 unit lab, taught by Roger Boulton

  VEN 128/128L  Wine Microbiology.  2 units each, taught by David Mills

  VEN 135  Wine Technology and Winery Systems.  5 units, taught by David Block

  VEN 140  Distilled Beverage Technology.  3 units, offered in alternate years, taught by Roger Boulton.

Fresno State Rivalry

At 125 years, the the department is still considered the top V&E program in the county, it has recently faced a challenge from the http://cati.csufresno.edu/verc/ Viticulture and Enology Program at http://www.csufresno.edu/ Fresno State.
