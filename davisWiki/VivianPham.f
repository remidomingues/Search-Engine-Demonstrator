20050621 09:19:20 nbsp Molly/Poots original name was Pootunia, but it didnt really stick.  Miriam and I hemmed and hawed, and couldnt come up with the perfect name, so called her Poot in the meantime.  One drunken night we decided that she would be Pootleberry Dinglehoppersuccess, the perfect name!but she turned out to be such a wonderful little kitten that Pootleberry Dinglehopper seemed too sophomoric.  So, she became Molly
 I still call her Poot.  :) Users/SummerSong
