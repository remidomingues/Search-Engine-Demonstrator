I graduated from UC Davis with a degree in Managerial Economics in Winter 04.  I currently work in the Bay Area as a consultant, but spend the occasional weekend back in Davis.

In my spare time I run the Sports2Kids website which accepts sports equipment donations for the YMCA.

Ive also helped tweak the map code for wikispot/daviswiki to make maps a little easier to use.


20070717 12:34:04 nbsp Thanks for the advice ,but at the time I did not know what I was doing wrong. I had several clients that wanted to make comments on my page, but instead are old fashion and wrote letters expressing their opinions instead. After looking at other sitters sites i realized their reference section was also created by them and comments added by the sitters themseleves. I learned and a valuable lesson and it will not happen again, i am ow aksing just as you suggested to please remove your comment about the whole astroturfing thing. thank you and you are right that i truly love animals.
Have a great day Users/ElizabethBarthel

20070731 15:18:49 nbsp Hey Vlad, to set a home wiki in your settings you need to watch the wiki you want as your home.  Just click watch this wiki when youre at the wiki.  This makes the wiki appear on the wiki:wikispot:Interwiki Recent Changes page, as well.  Thanks for your suggestions too! Users/PhilipNeustrom

20070808 10:20:12 nbsp wow i did not even notice that deletion.  How did that person find that negative comment?  did she/he do some sort of search.  seams odd.  Thanks for your attention to detail. Users/MattHh

20080324 18:12:46 nbsp Nice welcome message to Users/AngelaGerould. The only suggestion would be to direct her to Wiki Community as a whole rather than to Users/PhilipNeustrom. Thanks for taking care of that. Users/JasonAller

20080325 10:21:14 nbsp I do manage Dr. Tomaichs practice. Please understand that it is not the negative commment, I value patients comments. The fact is that the person that posted it is not a patient. That is what is troublesome to me.  Users/AngelaGerould
