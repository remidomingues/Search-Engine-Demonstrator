The http://vae.trug.com/ Vocal Art Ensemble (VAE) is an a cappella choir founded in February 2008. Directed by Tracia Barbieri, the group ranges from 1824 auditioned singers and performs in Davis, Sacramento, Dixon, Woodland, and the surrounding area.

The singing group presents themed concerts each spring and winter, aiming to  share exquisite music through artful musicianship. Targeting both the discerning musician and the casual music lover, performances feature a cappella choral pieces and intimate instrumentals by accomplished local performers.

VAEs repertoire frequently falls into one of three categories: choral motets and madrigals from the Renaissance (Tallis, Byrd, Sheppard, etc.), contemporary choral works (Whitacre, Lauridsen, Forrest, etc.), and folk music from other cultures (African, Swedish, Russian, etc.). However, the chorus has also been known to present pieces from the classical performance repertoire.

The ensemble rehearses in the home of the director, with the goal of bringing together experienced musicians pursuing artistic expression through finesse of the human voice. New members must be strong musicians, as the focus of this ensemble is blend, balance, and musicianship.

In September 2010 the group expanded its performance area to include a selffunded tour of Ireland, and a second tour is scheduled for May 2014 to England and Scotland.

VAE has also sung at special events such as church services, weddings, art gallery receptions, holiday parties and retirement homes.

Rather than sell tickets, VAE relies exclusively on audience donations at concerts or payment at gigs to fund its programs, and does not charge singer dues or require fundraising efforts or sponsorship from corporations or local service groups.

 Ireland Tour 
VAEs first international tour was of Ireland and took place from September 211, 2010. It included performances at Kylemore Abbey in Kylemore, St. Marys Church in Killarney, St. Canice Cathedral in Kilkenny, and St. Patricks Cathedral in Dublin. The group also participated in a Catholic mass in Charleville, and joint performance with two Irish choirs at St. Peters church in Bandon.

The performances were greeted with great appreciation, both for their musical calibre and for their help in fund raising efforts. St. Peters church performance, for instance, raised euro 1125 to aid in the restoration of the church organ, and according to an email correspondence from a representative at the local Kilbrogan house in Cork, it was so rare that we get a choir of such calibre here in our small town.

The groups final performance in Dublin was attended by the arranger of one of the pieces on the program, notably Dr. David Mooney, whose arrangement of the Irish Folk Song Dulaman was performed in Gaelic by the group throughout the tour. Mooney reported to the group in an email correspondence that it was an excellently chosen programme and delivered with great musicianship and style. Your group makes a really beautiful sound. I really enjoyed the whole performance.

 Performance History 

The choral ensembles debut concerts, entitled New Renaissance, were held in May 2008 in Davis and Woodland. With 15 singers, the chorus presented Renaissance motets and modern choral works. The concerts also included a classical guitar ensemble led by http://www.matthewgrasso.com Matthew Grasso. Their first year together concluded with a December concert series entitled O Nata Lux, which included Christmas pieces centering around the coming of light into darkness; the concerts included performances by the http://dolancstringquartet.com/ Dolanc String Quartet.

The groups second year included two multicultural concert sets. In May 2009 were three performances entitled Tally Ho  Music of the British Isles. Aiming to tour the United Kingdom and taste of its rich musical flavours, the performances featured celtic instrumentals from guitarist Ray Frank of Mudlark and fiddler / octave mandolinist Bob Wren, and modern English classical guitar by http://www.matthewgrasso.com Matthew Grasso. The December 2009 concert set, entitled Voyages Musicaux  Carols from Distant Lands, explored the human experience of faith, anticipation, and the celebration of new life through the music of more than twenty nations. It again featured guitarist Ray Frank of Mudlark and fiddler / octave mandolinist Bob Wren with more world instrumentals. The final performance at the Unitarian Universalist Church of Davis U.U. Church of Davis was enthusiastically received by a standingroom only crowd.

VAE is currently in its third year, presenting some novel and unique approaches to choral performance programming. In May 2010 they presented Great Beyond  Grief, Comfort, Hope, which interpreted Elisabeth KüblerRoss’ Five Stages of Grief through music with tremulous motets, spiteful madrigals, and ominous modern pieces eventually leading to songs of peace, clarity, and beauty wondrous beyond words. Praised by http://www.yolohospice.org/ Yolo Hospice, which has offered the community comfort, support, and guidance for 30 years, Great Beyond honored both the struggle of letting go and the beautiful possibilities awaiting us on the other side of acceptance.

In anticipation of the groups performance tour of Ireland that September, VAE was the featured performer at the Village Homes Performers Circle Performers Circle that July, and in August presented a onenight concert entitled VAE Visits Ireland, which previewed their tour repertoire in Davis before embarking on their tour less than two weeks later.

>In December 2010 the group presented Christmas Origins  Choral Art Through the Centuries. VAE traced medieval Christmas texts to their roots, presenting a path of musical stepping stones through the ages, honoring a cherished history of holiday song. The concert presented  various settings of texts such as Ave Maria, Bogoroditsye Devo and Es Ist Ein Ros’ Entsprungen as they were interpreted through the following ages by musicians such as Bruckner, Lauridsen, Rachmaninoff, and Praetorius.  The choir performed three concerts (one to a standingroomonly crowd) earning them praise for their level of artistry and thecomplexity in the harmonies as well as their ability to perform the entire concert from memory!

>
>In May 2011, the Vocal Art Ensemble presented Cloudburst  Songs of Nature at venues in Davis, Sacramento and Dixon. This concert painted a picture of the natural world with playful madrigals, stunning modern works, and evocative pieces that span the world’s cultures. We glimpsed birdsong at breaking dawn, whimsical frog and firefly, shimmering ocean, thundering rainstorm and quiet, earthly rest. Featuring delicate instrumentals and contemplative poetry, Cloudburst explored the wonders across our beautiful Earth. The grand finale, Eric Whitacres Cloudburst, featured the Juuliebells handbell choir of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Davis, who joined the singers in recreating the sounds of a thunderstorm.

>
>The Vocal Art Ensemble presented SOLSTICE in December of 2011.  The concert was a vocal and dance representation of the Solstice as winter’s turning point — a time to embrace both dark and light through song and timeless ritual. The rich darkness of medieval masses and modern tone clusters were enlivened by interludes of balletic dance by Ecokinesis and crowned by Barber’s luminous Agnus Dei. Audience members were encouraged to soak in the changing light with a pirouette of exquisitely intertwined voice and movement.
