Shayna offers instruction that reflects her wellrounded background, drawing from experiences in a variety of disciplines and with horses of all breeds and skill sets.  She believes in establishing a correct foundation by working methodically to achieve harmony between horse and rider.

Dressage lessons focus on the steady progression through the training pyramid and up the levels.  Shayna is devoted to helping each horse and rider achieve their goals, and as such is always happy to guide clients through any aspect of care or training.  From offering instruction on proper show turnout, to choosing appropriate supplements or tack, Vogel Training works to create owners that are not only educated riders, but wellrounded horsepeople.

Equitation lessons focus on achieving a correct position on the flat, allowing both hunters and jumpers to establish a sharp horse that performs better over fences.  Shayna uses basic dressage tenets to help H/J riders become both effective in their aids and attractive in their position.
