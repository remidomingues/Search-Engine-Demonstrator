Volleys Tennis Shop is located in downtown Davis near the intersection of 3rd Street and G Street G streets in the Court & Cedar building. Owned by two friends who purchased the shop from a group of local tennis players in November, 2012, they carry everything for tennis plus strings for badminton, racquetball, and squash. This includes clothing, tennis Shoe Stores & Repair shoes, and tennis racquet bags, as well as a wide variety of accessories.

Volleys is the exclusive Yolo County dealer of Babolat products, the topselling tennis equipment manufacturer worldwide.  Volleys carries Wilson, Prince, Dunlop, and Head tennis racquets, as well as junior racquets, balls, and shoes. There is also a demo racquet program that allows you to test out the latest models of racquets so you can decide what you want to buy. The deposit for this program is refunded if you buy a racquet.

They restring tennis, racquetball, squash, and badminton racquets, usually in 72 hours, although often much more quickly.

Come on by to check out the latest equipment you need to enjoy your time on the courts.

20061115 14:17:53 nbsp Its a cozy little shop, so you wont find a milelong rack of racquets here. But great, friendly service and good advice more than makes up for it. All tennis players, from complete beginners to tournament players, could benefit from this store. YomibitoShirazu

20080928 22:21:19 nbsp I love this store.  They can meet all of your tennis needs.  I recently dropped by for a new grip for my racket and some tennis balls.  Everyone is so friendly and helpful.  And theyll tell you about all the happenings in the world of tennis, including info on tournaments.

I highly recommend this place. Users/CurlyGirl26

20090602 17:33:18 nbsp Ive been to Volleys a few time for restringing, and every time I have been there, the employees have been extremely friendly and helpful.  Though it is a tennis shop, they restring racquetball and badmintton too (they only sell tennis strings, but you can bring in your own string).  Overall, a great store. Users/E.Liu

20090623 20:12:16 nbsp we actually do have a small assortment of badminton and squash strings (we can always special order specific strings) Users/KatherineL

20110602 17:05:05 nbsp I just went into Volleys and the service and the people who work there are really helpful and professional!! I would recommend it to anyone. Users/wilsonrocks

20110602 17:05:05 nbsp Very friendly staff, but having your racket restringed is rather expensive (paid 34$, of course depends on what kind of string you want), and they did a very bad job on my racket.  Users/adrienhoarau
