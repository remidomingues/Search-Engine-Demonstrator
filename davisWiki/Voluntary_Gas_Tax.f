The voluntary gas tax is a selfimposed and selfcollected tax established by a group of Davisites.  That is to say, they keep track of the gas they use, decide on a rate at which to tax themselves, and donate the proceeds to one of a few nonprofit organizations selected by the group.  If youd like to get involved, contact mailto://davisgastax@gmail.com davisgastax@gmail.com.  More info on the idea can be found at http://www.voluntarygastax.org/ voluntarygastax.org and at File(Davis Enterprise Column on Voluntary Gas Tax.pdf)

 Origins 
The idea for the tax was brought to Davis by a delegation from Harrisonburg, Virginia that was visiting town to look at the local bike infrastructure in the Winter of 2010.

 Past Beneficiaries 
Each quarter the group chooses a new set of beneficiaries and each member chooses the beneficiaries to which they will donate their tax money.  Previous lucky organizations have included:
 The Davis Bike Collective
