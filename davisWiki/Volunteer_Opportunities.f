Volunteering is a great way to benefit your community, meet cool people, have a cool experience, and maybe learn something new.

Volunteering differs from interning in that:
  Internships are typically of longer duration; volunteering can last for a long time too, but typically does not entail an expectation that the volunteer will continue volunteering
  Volunteering is never paid, while internships sometimes are
  Volunteering may or may not offer education, while interning is supposed to offer education

 Apartment MoveOut Waste Reduction Program needs volunteers from August 28  September 1 to work whatever hours they can (morning, afternoon or evening) to help keep the donation stations organized and sort materials. Volunteers are invited to keep any items they wish that have been donated. Every year the City of Davis Recycling Program teams up with apartment managers to encourage reuse of items and to reduce the amount of waste that happens during the yearly August moveout. Davis Recycling staff sets up donation stations at participating apartment properties, and residents donate items they no longer want or need. Local nonprofit groups and other apartment residents stop by and take the items they want. The end result is that good, usable items are kept out of the trash.
