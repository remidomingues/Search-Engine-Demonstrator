We need your help.  The Wiki Pledge drive planning pledge drive is in its final weeks, and we still need to approach a lot more businesses.  Among our Wiki Pledge Drive 2010/Events events is a silent auction which will be held at Rominger West Winery on Thursday, September 9th.  The goal there is to auction off any inkind donations (e.g. gift certificates, merchandise, and so on) we get from businesses as part of the pledge drive.  To make that happen, though, we need to approach more businesses.

We will also have additional auction items, provided by members of the wiki community, and naturally were happy to take monetary donations from businesses.

If you are willing and able to help out, please post your name and email address here.  Weve got materials and an outline of the pitch you can make to businesses, and all that good stuff.  If you arent able to help out, talk to your friends who use the wiki, and see if any of them would be willing to pitch in!
