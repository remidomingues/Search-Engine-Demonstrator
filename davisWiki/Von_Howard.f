Von Howard actually used to be a professional musician and teacher until things went all wrong.

Now he is an old drunk that resembles http://www.baramerica.com/muse/drinkers/charles_bukowski.html Charles Bukowski but with frizzier hair. Guitar in hand, he frequents Downtown, mostly on G street in front of Woodstocks Pizza Woodstocks. The odds are he has asked you for change. If you ask him to play a song, it will be well worth the dollar tossed in his direction.


20050107 19:03:10 nbsp He truly is an excellent guitar player.  Hes provided entertainment during manyanevening, especially around Little Prague.  And even though I probably wasnt helping him, Ive gladly thrown some change his way.  Hes a valueadded begger.  Most people just ask for change and tell you some lie.  This guy is honest and talented. Users/JaimeRaba

20051115 18:55:53 nbsp If this is the guy im thinking of, I gave him ten bucks so he could get his guitar fixed and he insisted on giving me a really nice 25 foot guitar amp cable in return.  Users/ThomasGray

20060823 15:52:15 nbsp He occasionally plays on the patio at Bistro33 on Saturday nights.  Call ahead to find out when, sit on the patio, have a drink, eat a little dinner, and enjoy the music. Users/RussellAnderson

20090428 12:21:57 nbsp Is this the guy thats taken to playing harmonica & guitar in front of Petes in the afternoons? It doesnt really sound like it though due to the musical ability difference between the two. Someone should snap a pic of one or both of them.  Users/MasonMurray
