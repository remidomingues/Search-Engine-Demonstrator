Voorhies Hall, designed by Gardner Action Dailey, was named for Edwin C. Voorhies address(and houses, 38.541134, 121.746660) the English department, the University Writing Program (the purveyors of the English Comp and upperdivision writing requirements), the Davis Humanities Institute, the Medieval Studies department, and a few others. It was built in 1959. Fondly called Voorhideous by some of its inhabitants. This is one of the buildings on campus that is primarily offices, not classrooms.

Voorhies Courtyard is a rose garden, with a giant tree and some benches. Not to mention the nice (though constantly leaking) fountain.

Voorhies Hall is also the home base of the Voorhies FBombs, an IM Sports Intramural Ultimate Frisbee team made up of English Graduate Students.

 

Ive had my office in Voorhies for four years, and Ive never heard the term Voorhideous. Users/TonyMagagna

Maybe if youd leave that office youd hear people call it Voorhideous.  Even I have called it that.  Ive heard just about everyone call it that. Users/NathanMilos

20090831 12:33:53 nbsp Is it true that the staircase area was designed to lock out/gas students if they tried to take over the building (in the 60s and 70s)? Users/BryceH
  Considering that it was built in 1959, that doesnt seem very plausible. Users/jsogul
