 Eligibility for Voting 
The right to vote can, like some other legal rights, be lost through judicial process (conviction of certain types of crimes, findings of mental incompetence, etc).  In many cases, the specific right to vote can be reinstated by a judge either temporarily or permanently depending on the circumstance.
