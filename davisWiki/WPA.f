The http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Works_Progress_Administration Works Progress Administration, or WPA, was a one of the largest New Deal programs instituted by President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression.  It provided jobs to unemployed workers, usually through civic improvement projects.

Davis still bears the stamp of these WPA projectsliterally.  Perhaps youve seen the WPA initials imprinted in a sidewalk while strolling through old North Davis.  These sidewalks were laid in the late 1930s with federal funding through the Works Progress Administration.  Look on the corner curbs at intersections for the most obvious stamps, especially along C Street.

Below is a gallery of WPA marks in Davis.  Add any that you find, and be sure to mention where you found it!
