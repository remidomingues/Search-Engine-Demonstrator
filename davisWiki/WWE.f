All I can remember is  it was a house show at the rec hall, and Stacy Keibler was there. (Users/benjaminrosenstein Ben Rosenstein, one other, and Daubert myself saw her before the show while we were at Teriyaki Express she ran into Ritz Camera. HHH was in attendance and had a match, so did XPac and Rick Flair. I will find the date that it was eventually, I think it was just after tough enough season one...

Does anyone know any place in town/sports bar/restraunts thats shows WWE PPVs? Users/JosephBleckman
The grad used to show them every month for 5 bucks, there were a decent turnout and wrestlemania definetly jumped off, perhaps we should try and bring that back  Users/StevenDaubert

20110407 22:52:30 nbsp The Grad is mainly doing UFC PPVs these days. But I would love if they would bring back WWE PPVs. I think we should send them some emails or something. Maybe just stick with the big PPVs like Royal Rumble, Wrestlemania, survivor series...etc. I always love it when I run into another pro wrestling buff. Users/Dozer
