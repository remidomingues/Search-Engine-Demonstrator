Wachovia no longer exists in Davis. Premier West Bank purchased two of their branches in California, one of which happened to be here. The branch is still at the same location, and all former employees were retained, its just Premier West instead, which on a side note I would stay far, far away from, mostly because they have so few branches in our area, and even fewer available ATMs.  This branch was formerly a World Savings Bank branch. Wachovia bought World Savings. The name changed over to Wachovia on October 11, 2007.

History

Citibank announced on September 29, 2008 that they were going to buy the banks owned by Wachovia for $2.16 billion. However, Wells Fargo later offered to buy all of Wachovia for $15.1 billion. Citibank eventually gave up and let Wells Fargo buy Wachovia. The Wachovia branch was across the street from Wells Fargo and Wells Fargo decided to sell the branch to Premier West Bank. There were no longer any Wachovia ATMs in Davis after the branch was sold to Premier West Bank.

After Wells Fargo bought Wachovia, Wachovia customers were able to get cash at any Wells Fargo ATM without a fee. Wells Fargo customers were also able to get cash at Wachovia ATMs without a fee.

Wells Fargo has converted all Wachovia branches to Wells Fargo.

20080602 17:43:15 nbsp Dont bank if you dont have to! I was a World Savings customer for years and am very unhappy with the merge with Wachovia The new staff is unprofessional and unfriendly and they just dont seem to care. Its very sad and disapointing to see. Their fees are outrageous and their phone customer service stinks even more than the personal experience. Users/marabella

20090725 20:33:12 nbsp I dont have the time to do a full change on this page, but I thought id make anyone reading this aware that wachovia no longer exists in Davis. Premier West Bank puchased two of their branches in California, one of which happened to be here. The branch is still at the same location, and they seem to have many of the same employees, its just Premier West instead, which on a side note I would stay far, far away from, mostly because they have so few branches in our area, and even fewer available ATMs.  Users/Oceaniax
