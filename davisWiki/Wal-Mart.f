WalMart (often called Wally World) is that other big box store that isnt considered as nice as Target and is http://www.cockeyed.com/citizen/target/walmart_versus_target01.html slightly cheaper for nonedible products.  However, in March of 2011, several new studies have shown that Target prices are now slightly cheaper than Walmart http://consumerist.com/2011/03/istargetnowcheaperthanwalmart.html link.  The Dixon WalMart was upgraded to a WalMart Supercenter in the early 2000s and now features a grocery section comparable in size to that of most grocery stores grocery chains, and seemingly cheaper than those in Davis. Its freezer section is particularly large and diverse. However, its location may make it unfavored for regular grocery runs. Generally, their prices are quite low. However, not all items are a bargain. You can find items cheaper at regular supermarkets if they are on sale.

The West Sac Walmart contains a QuickHealth QuickHealth doctors office.

If youre going to the Dixon Walmart from the Davis direction: When you take the offramp, please dont slow down to 20 mph (or even stop) on the offramp while you try to figure out which way to go. Just keep the speed up and go up and over the overpass, and youll see what to do from there. That would be great, thanks.

Northern California stores http://www.walmart.com/cservice/contextual_help_popup.gsp?modId200854 can receive anything ordered via http://www.walmart.com/ their website at no charge.  Since certain very heavy or large items can be extremely expensive to ship, Walmart may be a good place to acquire furniture or grills cheaper than many local stores.

On April Fools Day, 2006, somebody placed a Super WalMart Coming Soon sign at farm property on the corner of Pole Line and Covell.

In recent years, Walmart has begun dropping the supercenter name from their stores. They simply refer to all stores as Walmart. This makes it difficult to determine which Walmart stores have full grocery departments. Many regular nonsupercenter Walmart stores now have a small grocery section with produce and baked goods.

Generally, Walmart is known for its crowds, long lines, messy stores, and the type of people that their stores attract. Often people who have limited income flock to Walmart because they cannot afford to shop anywhere else. This often leads to a very diverse and eccentric variety of customer. Walmart is a place where people often go to people watch, or gawk, or stare, or take photos and post to PeopleOfWalmart.com.

The Pharmacy At Walmart

Please note that the Pharmacy at Walmart is somewhat separated from the rest of the store. The employees in the Pharmacy are paid much better than employees in the rest of the store. The pharmacists are paid very high salaries that are competitive with the wages at other drug stores. In addition, the pharmacy technicians are also paid competitively. Full time employees also receive health benefits and depending on their type of plan often have low or no copay for prescriptions.

The Pharmacy at Walmart has a list of medications that only cost $4. There is also a list of $10 prescriptions for a 90 day supply. The $4 and $10 medication list is often seen as a loss leader. What this means is that the store loses money on the $4 prescriptions. The profit is given away in the hopes that customers buy products in the rest of the store to make up for the loss in prescription profit. Not all medicines appear on this list. It is only a list of common generic medications.

The low price medications are actually a help to people who have limited funds and can be a life saver for those who dont have much cash. The pharmacy also price matches other pharmacies. If you find a lower price at another pharmacy, you can talk to a pharmacist and see if you can get a price match. The pharmacy does not match wholesale club stores such as Costco.


General information:
These facts are irrelevant to Davis in particular, however they are interesting and may affect your buying decision.

Across the nation, WalMart sells http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4253981.stm half a million dollars of products every single minute of every single day.
WalMart made the largest http://money.cnn.com/2005/09/13/news/fortune500/katrina_donations/ corporate donation to Hurricane Katrina relief efforts in absolute terms. Largest contributions as percentage of earnings are unknown.

Walmart Supercenters, such as found in Dixon, common in the Midwest since their inception several years ago, are now popping up all over California. New locations in the Greater Sacramento Area locations include Citrus Heights, Roseville (across Highway 65 from the Target store), and Yuba City (adjacent to Highway 20). WalMart reached a major milestone in March 2006 with its http://www.walmartfacts.com/community/article.aspx?id1742 2,000th Supercenter opening in Beaumont, CA.

Walmart sells fair trade certified coffee.  Some of it comes (or used to) from http://www.washingtonpost.com/wpdyn/content/article/2006/06/11/AR2006061100813.html Rosevaldo Jose Pereira in Brazil.

Walmart is also starting to sell many more organic products under the Wild Oats brand at a price lower than most other stores. You can often find many affordable organic products and this can save a great deal of money in the long run.



20070101 20:20:32 nbsp Walmart is not a Pictionary selling institution. Users/MattFrantz

20070310 17:55:02 nbsp Their lines arent nearly as bad as they were a few months ago, its unfair to them to say thats a problem. Also, walmart isnt the only store who has self checkout, sometimes its faster and easier. Albertsons, home depot,  what about ATM machines (ATAutomated Teller). However this is problem with the store in Dixon... on more than one occassion I have left a bag behind full of merchandise after the cashier has assured me that Ive got all my stuff. Its annoying and potentially expensive. I learned my lesson the hard way and although the savings are still well worth it, make sure you have all your stuff because its easy to leave behind a bag or two on the little round about things they use. Now I literally go through my receipt the moment its printed. Asking the cashier, is that everything? isnt enough.  Users/TonyOrozco

20070524 22:59:18 nbsp I LOVE WALMART Users/wesleywang

20071106 22:38:22 nbsp I love Walmart.  I go to the Dixon WalMart once a week.  They carry Amys organic entrees for lunch.  My husband likes the Zatarans frozen entrees.  All the items I buy for my family I can get at much lower prices than Safeway or Nugget:  cheddar cheese sticks for my kids, whole wheat pasta including lasagna noodles (which I cant find anywhere else at this price). minibagels, basmati rice & school supplies. My kids like their clothes & electronics section.  I just bought my boys new bikes they picked out (Mongoose dualsuspension mountain bike for $100 & Huffy black beach cruiser bike for $80).  Walmart does a service to those folks who cannot afford or have the brains not to overpay at CoOp or Nugget.  And if you dont like the lines, use the selfcheckout.  I let my kids do all the checking out and bagging.  They have fun & it saves me time.  The only other store in Davis with selfcheckout is the SaveMart (formerlly Albertsons).  To avoid lines I go shopping at WalMart either Sunday morning, when people are asleep or at church ,or during the dinner hour (67pm0 on weekdays.  And stop at Pedrick Produce on the way to get fresh produce.  Recently I started going to the West Sacramento WalMart Super Center which is even bigger and the grocery shelves are full.Users/musicamyl

20071107 10:05:37 nbsp Some people choose to shop at the Davis Food Coop and Nugget because they prefer to pay something close to the true cost of food and household goods, in actual cash, right away.  Instead of mortgaging part of the cost in the form of pollution, unsustainable transportation, tradedeficit labor and unethical marketing.  When you think, affordable, http://adbusters.org/metas/eco/truecosteconomics/true_cost.html think longterm. Users/MattJurach

20071108 17:59:19 nbsp Can anyone tell me whether or not the prices on groceries there are comparable to grocery outlet or winco? Users/AnnaF

20071108 20:38:41 nbsp Some people choose to shop at walmart because we dont have the money to spend to buy more expensive food and some of us choose to pollute the world with useless tshirts blaming walmart, heckling those who shop there, fighting for the removal of walmarts, and telling poor people they should not work at Walmart because it is bad while at the same time offering little to help the person without any extra income. In the end until we can make food without harming the environment as much I choose this than telling a family to foreclose on a house, be a product of malnutrition, and not having a computer to post on the wiki(oh wait they dont shop there they go to nugget and the coop). Users/Dean

20071108 21:13:51 nbsp There is a WalMart Controversy page already. I am not sure why there is a page about WalMart on a Davis Wiki in the first place, since there is no WalMart in Davis. But if you want to debate WalMart, here is the place: http://daviswiki.org/WalMart/Controversy

20071217 10:51:11 nbsp The WalMart in Vacaville and Dixon havent been carrying fenders lately for bikes. What a bummer. I guess Dixons WalMart isnt so super, now is it? Users/ChristineLim

20080328 17:27:35 nbsp You get what you expect to pay at Walmart: long lines and lost customer service representatives. Honestly when it comes to Walmart employees they cant help you find anything because they simply cant understand you or they dont know where anything is themselves. Case in point: Most recently I asked someone to show me where the Tofu was...He said, Tofu? Whats that? I proceeded to ask another employee where an on sale inad item was. They couldnt find it! One employee asked another, then proceeded to ask another. I had an entire team of Walmart employees looking for an item and they just couldnt do it.

Final words: Go to Walmart and youre on your own.  Users/senioritis

20110418 02:43:54 nbsp The Woodland location recently went through a remodeling, like many other locations I would guess. I have to say, its a marked improvement from the way it was (not that I like shopping at WalMart, but sometimes you have to). They made the isles bigger somehow, and the store just looks cleaner overall. Users/CecilioPadilla

20110929 20:38:14 nbsp WalMart is pretty evil. They are staunchly antiunion, they intentionally pay their fulltime workers wages low enough that they qualify for medicaid. They absolutely DESTROY small businesses due to the fact that they can undersell and even run at a loss to drive their competition out of business, which is technically illegal. They are one of the biggest importers from China (I dont need to explain the working conditions over there for you).

Dont shop there, there are other inexpensive options that dont destroy the community. Users/ConsciousConsumer

20120616 22:42:48 nbsp Wal Mart in Dixon is not evil. Whats EVIL are the prices in Davis for every little thing. Whats evil is the price in Davis for a mere oil change at what passes for car repair shops there. At Wal Mart in Dixon its only either $25 or $35 depending on whether or not you want the older car oil special. From where I live in whats almost West Davis, the Wal Mart store in Dixon is the same distance as Target or even closer. And the employees are always there helping me and furthermore their Pharmacy did all they could to get my prescriptions down to their $4.00 rate even including calling the doctor FARTHER DOWN THE STREET IN DOWNTOWN DIXON to ask permission to split the thing into its two constituent drugs and bottle them separately so it would be covered under their $4.00 formulary. Anyone saying anything else apparently wants to pay upwards of $77.00 OR MORE for prescription medicines? I sure dont. Im a substitute teacher and extra money like that doesnt grow on trees. I dont have health insurance or prescription coverage so Im stuck having to find low cost or free clinics and get the prescriptions filled at WalMart and this is for Blood Pressure medicine  which is, of course, from living broke for most of my adult life for reasons not WalMarts fault. But if you dont like WalMart you must be a selfmade millionaire and can afford to have your prescriptions filled elsewhere.....but not me, thanks for your opinions but no thanks.  Users/PaigeKennedy
 if youre  concerned about money, change your own oil and get your scrips over the internet. I shop at Walmart, but its not the cheapest so much as it is the easiest. users/mikeycrews

20120921 06:59:36 nbsp There is no way internet prescriptions are anywhere near the $4.00 that WalMart charges. The only option there is to shop overseas in which case theres a hell of a long wait for the thing to arrive in this country and pass through Customs at SFO. Sure, no expensive doctor visit but youre technically breaking the US drug enforcement law doing it that way. And car repair is more than oil changes. Being charged upwards of $700 for a $14.99 distributor in Davis when the problem was actually the ignition coil anyway, a mere $75 part, is way more than being ripped off on an oil change...which I hear are regularly in the $100 range in Davis anyway. And my original statement still stands. Anyone who knocks WalMart is a selfmade millionaire who wants public school substitute teachers to overpay for prescription medicines to the extent that we do without, which could be FATAL, or spend so much on the prescription that we cant do other things like EAT, pay our rent or keep our car running so that we CAN get to the job. You might as well tell me that St Lukes in San Francisco should be closed because the services are FREE and theyre a moneyloser, since thats where my doctor is and youd get me started on the same schpiel. Selfmade independently wealthy millionaire snobs. Users/PaigeKennedy
 Wow, what a rant.  By the way, an oil change at Davisville Express Lube is $27 with the coupon you can print out yourself, and last time I went it was done in under 20 mins.  I think its about $35 at Hoffmann Automotive.  If youre hearing its $100+, it might be time to doubt the honesty of your sources. Users/TomGarberson
