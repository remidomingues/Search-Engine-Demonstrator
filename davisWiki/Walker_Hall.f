Address(Walker Hall, 38.539759, 121.750810), located in the middle of Campus,  was named for Harry B Walker and used to be the engineering building. As a matter of fact, if you look at the lintel above the main entrance, you can still see the original writing. Built in 1926, it is one of the first permanent buildings on campus.  It also used to house the Design department and Design Museum, so people often simply called it the Design Building. Now however, the Design Department has moved to Cruess Hall. Additionally, the Landscape Architecture department moved from the second floor of Walker Hall to their own wing of Hunt Hall in 2009.

Walker Hall is consistently a target for vandalism, theft, and various other security problems including a homeless man living in the loft in 2009. Administration and campus police are trying to better the situation by closing the building earlier and monitoring the various entrances overnight. The building is infested with insects of all types that swarm the building at night, especially Cockroaches and Crane Fly Crane Flies.

Walker Hall is was vacated to make room for a 450seat classroom and the http://dateline.ucdavis.edu/dl_detail.php?id13573 Walker Promenade, a treelined walkway leading from the Unitrans Hutchison Bus Terminal to Shields Library. This will require Walker Hall Annex to be demolished and the Walker wings to be renovated.

There used to be numerous Temporary Buildings to the west of Walker Hall. Some formerly contained design labs, Helge B. Olsen Furniture Studio studios, faculty offices, and the woodshop. Walker Hall Annex is a temporary building located to the south of the main hall and is rather difficult to find given that it is not listed on any maps. All of the Temporary Buildings were vacated and removed by summer 2010. The former location of the temporary buildings is now the site for the new Student Community Center.
