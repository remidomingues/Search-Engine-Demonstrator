I visited the UC Davis campus when my girlfriend went to school there  dont ask how long ago  and fell in love with the area.  Ive always wanted to go to school or move to the area, but alas, never had the chance to do it.  But, the time I spent there left an impression and the Davis area will always have a place in my heart!
