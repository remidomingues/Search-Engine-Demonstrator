Around Davis (and throughout California) you can find signs with warnings about cancer and birth defects.

They are a result of http://www.oehha.ca.gov/prop65.html Prop 65 which passed in 1986. Take the time to read http://www.oehha.ca.gov/prop65/p65faq.html the FAQ if you have questions about why one of these signs might be posted.

There are also warning signs in Davis with illustrations of people getting smashed by gates and running away from a fire!

20070809 12:13:55 nbsp What is really amusing is that the signs occasionally appear on goods outside of California, which makes California look odd.  A bar conversation amongst a group (most of whom had never been to California) figured the signs arent needed elsewhere because it is generally known outside of California that drinking nail polish remover and sucking on tailpipes is bad for your health.  To a certain extent, it links California and chemical hazards (or witless dangerous behavior) in some peoples minds. Users/JabberWokky
