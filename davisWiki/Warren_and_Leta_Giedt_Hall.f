Address(Warren and Leta Giedt Hall,38.537691,121.755232) is a 650seat, singlestory classroom building located immediately north of Kemper Hall, in UC Davis UC Daviss Engineering/Physical Sciences district. With two classrooms and three lecture theaters, including the 278seat 1001 Giedt Ted and Rand Schaal Auditorium (room 1001), Giedt Hall provides a stateoftheart learning environment for students from across the campus. Engineering and geology classes receive scheduling priority for the new classrooms because two of the projects major donors are former engineering and geology professors.

Giedt Hall is named for mechanical and aeronautical engineering professor emeritus Warren Giedt and his wife, Leta. The Giedts (pronounced Geets) donated $2.5 million toward the buildings construction. (http://www.dateline.ucdavis.edu/dl_detail.lasso?id8487 Dateline Article)  There was a ceremony honoring Giedt and the construction of the hall.  Giedt attended in a wheelchair and passed away a month or two after the ceremony.

The building has WiFi as of May 2010.

The Giedt Project is a local band named after the hall.

 Demolition and Construction 

In March 2006, 18 temporary buildings on the site were demolished to make way for the new hall.  These are the first temporary buildings to ever be removed from campus. See University Construction for other campus projects.
