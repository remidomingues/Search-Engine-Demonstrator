The Wash Mill was a Laundry & Drycleaning laundromat that primarily served East Davis; they were in business for 40 years.  When they closed, the price for the washers was $1.25, and the dryers were $0.25 for six minutes  but they were pretty industrial, so it would take you about $0.75$1.00 to wash a load, depending on the load.

There was some furniture in there labeled Old Mill Stream, which is presumably a prior name for the place.

They were forced to close in January 2013 when the landlord would not renew their lease.  Goodwill wanted to move into the space formerly occupied by All Things Right and Relevant, but said that that space wasnt big enough, and wanted the adjoining space occupied by Wash Mill as well.  Some found it ironic that a company dedicated to helping lowerincome people would deprive East Davis of its only laundromat, given that many people walked to the Wash Mill.  The Vanguard wrote three articles on the subject.

20091216 17:31:52 nbsp The cheapest washer is now $1.50. Users/amovolky

20100525 11:10:08 nbsp Pretty basic place and its not in the best neighborhood in Davis (some degree of riffraff associated with the Dollar Tree next door and a couple of homeless people milling about), but its clean, inexpensive, and everything works the way it should.  MASSIVE dryers cost 25 cents for 6 minutes and they work amazingly; it only cost me 75 cents and 18 minutes to dry a standard load of laundry (jeans included!)  Probably would have gotten it done in 12.  Would definitely recommend this place if you need your laundry done fast and dont care about frills. Users/AdamV

20100820 09:03:52 nbsp Great place. Very clean. I put three loads (including jeans, sheets, and towels) into one of the big industrial dryers, and everything was dry in 30 minutes. Its also VERY cheap here; basic wash is $1.50, or the frontloaders are $2.75 (not a bad price, considering you can fit twothree times as much compared to the toploaders). Right next to a Dollar Tree, if you get bored and like lead poisoning.Users/zombiek

20111223 20:08:28 nbsp Used to come here all the time before we became fancy folk and got our own washer/dryer.  Almost every other time we were there a worker was cleaning and scrubbingits nice the owners really try to keep it clean.  The dryers get insanely hot, which is nice, in my opinion.  I got into the habit though of only putting one quarter in the dyer to start and make sure it got hot before I put in the rest as occasionally a dryer might not work and would blow cold air.  There are notes on which you can mark machines that are out of order so other patrons know.  You can also inform the owner of how much money you have lost by leaving a note and she/he will send a refund, though the owner got persnickety with me over this so thats why I started testing the dryers with one quarter before putting all my quarters in.  Theres free wifi, which is sweet!  And I havent seen this 2004 magazine bobjonesbobjones speaks of, but there is often an interesting array of reading material.  The best part is, we never ever had to wait for a machine.  There are some times that are more busier than others, but its always been great in terms of instant washing gratification.
