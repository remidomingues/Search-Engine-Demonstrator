Washington Mutual (also known as WaMu) was a savings and loan association that provided banking services. After the bank went insolvent in 2008, its assets were purchased by JPMorgan Chase, and in March 2009 all California WaMu branches and ATMs became Chase branches and ATMs, including the ones in Davis.

It had an ATMs ATM and a talking ATM at this location along with the one in the MU Games Area. They remodeled in 2007 to update their look, moving the front door from southfacing to westfacing and added a safe, indoor ATM area accessible all hours via debit card authentication. Once upon a time, WaMu had a policy of not charging for access to accounts at other banks through their ATMs.

The people there were generally very friendly, if this isnt the case at all commercial banks. WaMu set itself apart from other banks by being very customercentric and nontraditional. They prided themselves on their casual laid back branches that featured stand up teller stations rather than a traditional bank counter. Their employees were able to dress in khaki pants, polo shirts, or denim shirts instead of suits and ties. They designed their branches to be stylish and welcoming. In their ads, they used WaMu as their name and coined the term Whoo hoo! Even their ATMs featured colorful and humorous ads setting themselves apart from other boring and reserved banks. One ad featured a lava lamp and another featured a guinea pig. Even their website was decked out in bright unconventional colors and had humorous photos.

Washington Mutual did not have any branches in California, until they purchased American Savings in 1996. American Savings had a lot of bad loans and American Savings itself went insolvent in the early 1980s and had to be bailed out by the government in the amount of $1.7 billion. Washington Mutual later expanded in 1998 by buying Home Savings of America. Unfortunately, WaMu got involved with subprime loans. They approved too many risky loans and didnt know how to say no. Their bad lending practices led to their demise.

As of March 8, 2009 all WaMu credit cards have been converted to Chase cards and now online credit card access is provided through http://www.chase.com instead of http://www.wamucards.com.

20080302 08:57:35 nbsp The free ATM withdrawals are for customers only.  They also dont charge if you need to use another banks ATM. Thats what those advertisement are about. Generally this bank is great. As with all banks the Overdraft fees are huge but if you keep track of your account you wont need to worry about it. Definitely the best bank choice for students.

20090724 15:55:47 nbsp After Chase bought Wamu, a smile sort of became more expensive in this Wamu/Chase branch as well. Many of them were celebrity lookalike when they smiled (if you notice carefully, there is one JasonMraz lookalike....seriously..lol.). I wished they would give away more smiles now. Anyhow, the services are still highclass, except for one thingthey didnt let me use colorful pens....JK.  Users/superdavis
