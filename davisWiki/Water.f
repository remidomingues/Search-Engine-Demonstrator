At room temperature, wiki:WikiPedia:Water water is a clear, colorless, odorless, tasteless liquid.  In agricultural areas, farmers use it to irrigate their fields.  Some of us just drink it.  Classical chemists believed it to be one of the four (or five) elements, while modern ones regard it as a compound of hydrogen and oxygen.
