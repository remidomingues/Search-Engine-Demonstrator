Often found fighting jocks, http://www.myspace.com/waterforfree Water For Free has gained noteriety as being Davis only Ultra RockStar band.  At first we all thought it was just screamo, but it turned out that this Dixon Dixonian 4 piece had MTV2 aspirations.  Fronted by Cafe Roma Cafe Romas most welcoming employee (and ex Bunny House resident) DeanONeil Dean O Neil, Water For Free is this areas most sought after group, and when their e.p. is finally dropped on us, we will all understand the mighty beast that is this band.
