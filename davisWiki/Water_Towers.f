The town of Davis contains three water towers, what being for the dissemination of delightful tasting Tap Water Davis tap water to its residents. They also contribute to the smalltown aesthetic that makes Davis oh so very popular with the kids and geriatric alike.

Main Towers


Lefttoright, these are:

The fashionable Address(UC Davis water tower, 38.535089, 121.750894) , located by the scenic Arboretum and also some buildings.  The UC Davis Logo was added during an incidental repainting of the tower on September 21^st^ 1995.

The Address(City Water Tower, 38.550298, 121.755843); stationed suspiciously adjacent to Daviss Church of Jesus Christ of LatterDay Saints Mormon church type establishment.

The rather Address(Dairy Field Water Tower, 38.537928, 121.759280), near the cow milking facilities on campus. In Fall of 2007, it was repainted and now includes the UCDavis logo. It has also been unofficially named Touchdown Tower for its close proximity to the new Aggie Stadium (http://www.ucdavis.edu/spotlight/0807/touchdown_tower.html Spotlight article).   Prior to 2007, it was emblazoned with the Oldschool Aggie Logo.

The left and right towers above are UC Davis owned watertowers.

Other Towers

There are also some other water towers in Davis.  These other water towers are much more spooky, being operated by monsters and goblins rather than mere mortal men.

If youre talking about the one on West 8th (Which is indeed a few streets off Russell, thats the Mormon watchtower I mentioned, what with it being directly adjacent to the Mormon church. Either that or theres one much further down Russell that looks almost exactly the same. Whatever. Nice Picture though.  Users/TravisGrathwell


Took this photo my freshman year (0102) of the Old School water tower near the dairy facility.  Kinda pretty. Users/KayRide
