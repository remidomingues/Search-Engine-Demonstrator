 Use 2030% less water? 


Today (1/16/2014), watching News 10 at 9, ABC, I heard, because of the very dry Winter, new water rationing rules start today in Sacramento.

The council approved what city officials described as a “stage 2 water shortage plan,” requiring those who live and work in Sacramento to reduce their water use by between 20 percent and 30 percent.

See http://www.sacbee.com/2014/01/14/6071929/sacramentocounciltoweighwater.html this source too.

I wonder if these restrictions (will?) apply to Davis too.
