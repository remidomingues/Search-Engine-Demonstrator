According to this rather fanciful wiki:WikiPedia:Wayne_Rosing Wikipedia Article, Wayne is awesome.

He was just appointed as a Senior Fellow in mathematics and physical sciences here at UCD in May of 2005. The first one ever, in fact. We made a fellowship just for him, thats how awesome he is.

You can find more about his nebulous accomplishments in this http://www.californiaaggie.com/news/2005/05/09/FrontPage/FirstEver.Senior.Fellow.Appointed.To.Mps1320478.shtml Aggie article.

Apparently he will be working on the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, which has a rather puny sounding name when compared to something like the wiki:WikiPedia:Overwhelmingly_Large_Telescope Overwhelmingly Large Telescope. However, the telescope promises to generate an obscene amount of data. Fortunately for us, Wayne will be crucial to management of data management,

Things Wayne has done that make him a badass: (subject to verification)
  Headed the team that invented wiki:WikiPedia:Java_programming_language Java
  Helped develop the wiki:WikiPedia:Apple_Lisa Apple Lisa
  Former VP of Google
  Developed the ability to shoot laser beams out of his eyes
