20100115 14:52:03 nbsp I have seen Dr. Schrader since moving to Davis five years ago. He and his staff have always been professional and courteous, worked with me to schedule appointments at convient times and to get the most out of my vision plans. They have a large selection of frames.  Users/mnightingale

20110620 15:53:45 nbsp Dr. Schrader is very patient.  I never feel rushed.  He doesnt try to upsell me.  His staff has always been very courteous and professional.  When they say something will be done by a certain date, it is done by that date.  I have been been seeing Wayne since the seventies. Users/jbelenis
