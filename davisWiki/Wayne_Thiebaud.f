wiki:WikiPedia:Wayne_Thiebaud Wayne Thiebaud is a graduate of California State University, Sacramento, and longtime Art Department art professor at UC Davis.  He currently teaches about 1 class per year and it is very popular.

     Thiebauds paintings of food and consumer goods, which first emerged in mature form in 196162 have become such a familiar part of our art historical landscape that the risks they first posed can easily be taken for granted. As already seen, the inclination towards depictions of commonplace objects from middleclass America  decidedly blue collar subjects in the hierarchies of stilllife painting  began to emerge for Thiebaud in the mid1950s, well before the romance with similar iconographies that characterized the Pop movement. Thiebauds choices may gesture backwards to such precedents as Stuart Daviss Odol bottle, Gerald Murphys safety razor, or even Marcel Duchamps urinal, but they mostly embrace objects that happened to be close at hand and that impressed him as interesting in character or presence. Also important in this development was his experience in advertising design and, for example, his layouts of simple objects in drugstore ads.

     It was the cafeteriatype foods, of course, the cakes, pies, ice creams, hamburgers, hotdogs, canapes, club sandwiches, and other staples of the American diet  all of which have a stereotypical thiscanbefoundanywhereinthecountrybutonlyin thiscountry quality  that brought Thiebaud most of his early notoriety.
