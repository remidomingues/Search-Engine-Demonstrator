20060421 17:41:34 nbsp If you have straight Asian hair like me and want it carefully and painstakingly layered, Kim Nguyen is the best person for the job.  She is, however, quite popular so its best to call and make an appointment.  I had the best service here and it was cheaper than Zibas. Users/QuynhNhuNguyen

20060617 11:59:12 nbsp I second giving props to Kim. One of the best haircuts Ive had in Davis was one she gave me. Ive also had my hair cut by the two other stylists who work at WCH and have had good experiences. Never had a bad cut there. Users/MarisolCortez

20060715 17:17:14 nbsp I have been getting my hair cut here for 3 years and they do an adequate job for the price.  My roomates (who probably have higher standards than me) even starting going here after they got fed up with having to pay $50 at a salon to get their hair layered, and they have been happy with it too.

20061104 14:57:22 nbsp i got a nice haircut there, however when i had a conditioning treatment done, one of the stylists added apricot orange coloring WITHOUT my permission when I had SPECIFICALLY asked for clear/natural ... now my hair is orange ...  Users/AllieStevens

20061109 16:18:33 nbsp After reading the comments on Wiki I called and made an appointment with Kim. She messed up on my hair and I came back the next day to get it fixed. She rolled her eyes at me and recut it. She made it look even worse. She is completely unprofessional at cutting hair. Instead of pulling the hair away from the neck and cutting it, she lined it up with my neck and cut it. Thats not how youre suppose to cut hair!!Users/LenaLim

20061202 00:40:53 nbsp I was traded around between different stylists. I was there for four hours. They were rough with my hair (pulled it out and broke it rather than gently working on tangles). I went in for a perm and came out with NO CURL. When I was done, my hair was straighter than when I went in, only it was huge, frizzy, brittle (even after the deep conditioning treatment), and badly cut. Fortunately, the frizziness hides the fact that the person who cut my hair did an awful job. Also, I fortunately like having my head look like it is covered in mohair yarn, but I dont like how damaged my hair is now, and I dont like all the frizzies I have from where my hair was broken. This place may have once been okay for people with asian hair, but I wouldnt trust it for an instant with my hair again. Users/GillianGroszkiewicz

20070418 18:18:51 nbsp I FOUND MELA!!!I have been getting my hair done at we care hair for several years now.

20070721 23:04:09 nbsp WE CARE HAIR WAS SOLD ON APRIL 2, 2007. AND DID NOT GO OUT OF BUSINESS... Users/Debbie

20070722 00:30:27 nbsp Could someone cruise by 1321 W. Covell Blvd. and confirm that We Care Hair is indeed gone?  I think Debbie is referring to a business in Southern California. Users/GrahamFreeman

20070722 01:06:07 nbsp It is gone.  Its right next to where Blockbusters is.  We Care Hair is actually a chain of salons, (wecarehairsalons.com), and I believe the entire chain was bought by Super Cuts, which is what Debbie is talking about.  But this location wasnt turned into a Super Cuts.  Its something else now...an optometrist I think I saw, already open maybe.  Noticed in passing the other week when I went to Jamba Juice.  I mean, maybe its becoming a Super Cuts, but I could have sworn seeing something about an optometrist. Users/EdWins
