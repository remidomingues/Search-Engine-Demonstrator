If you recently moved to Davis, it is important to remember that weather is relative: everybody has different comfort levels.  Davis has what is called a wiki:wikipedia:Mediterranean climate, which exists in  few places other than near the Mediterranean Sea.  This means that we experience cool, wet winters and hot, dry summers.  The heat drives people nuts in the summer and the rain and fog drives them bananas in the winter. Thats why Californias full of fruits and nuts. Spring and fall are great, though.

 Seasonal Weather 

 Summer 
Summer in Davis Davis summers are hot.  High temperatures average in the low 90s, with many days below and many days above that.  On particularly hot days the temperature reaches into the 100s and this can last for 3  4 days; the record number of days in a row over 100F is 8. In an average summer there are 15  20 days over 100 total through the summer. Hot spells occur when a high pressure ridge builds over the Sacramento Valley or the Great Basin and remains in place for a couple of days. Typically after 2  3 days a low pressure front pushes in from the ocean and the delta breeze returns, and high temperatures drop into the mid to upper 80s. Humidity is very low when it is hot, usually in the 15  30% range. Night temperatures in the summer are usually in the upper 50s.

We almost never get summer thunderstorms and there is virtually no rain at Summer Rain all during the summer. The nicest thing about summer in Davis is the night time.  The citys light ordinance is finally appreciated, as people can now enjoy the night time night sky.  Its still warm out, pleasant for hanging out or a late barbeque, enjoying cool drinks, even outdoor activities (glow in the dark frisbees anyone?).  The average low temperature for a July night is 56°F, typically past 3 or 4am.  Although sleeping at night can be comfortable despite a very hot day, sometimes night temperatures in July are still in the low 70s at 8 or 9, even (rarely) up to 10pm.


 Fall 
Four out of five farmers agree, fall is the best season of the year.  However, early fall in Davis is only slightly cooler than summer.  Notable concomitants of the season are trees that sport leaves of brilliant red, orange, and yellow.  Pumpkins pop up in the usual locations as well; at the Outskirts outskirts of the city, at the Farmers Market, and of course, on peoples doorsteps.  This is the best time of year to arrive in Davis as a student because the weather brings everyone outdoors; student organizations are recruiting left and right; and there are lots of freshmen and transfers who are just as bewildered and disoriented as you are!



 Winter 


Davis winters can be quite chilly but does not often go below freezing. The average high in December is about 54°F and the average low is about 36°F (source: http://www.weather.com/ Weather.com).  There is often a lot of fog which warms things up a little, but winter is basically the period that it rains. It can also get very windy and, combined with the rain, that can be difficult for cyclists.  If the trees havent already lost their leaves during our brief fall season, they lose them now.
Major freezes occurred in December 1990, when temperatures dropped into the midteens (F), December 1998, and January 2007. These killed subtropical plants and damaged the citrus crop throughout Northern California.

When http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_nino El Niño is in effect, there is typically more rainfall and http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/enso/femacal9803.html snowfall due to the warming of the Pacific Ocean. The 1982 El Niño brought us one of the snowiest and wettest winters on record for the state.





 Spring 
Spring is perhaps the nicest time of year, with occasional rain and a lot of Delta Breeze to keep it from getting too hot.  The Town Flora plants are very green, and The Quad is somewhat less muddy.  Youll find many parts of Davis to explode with spring flowers.  Not surprisingly, those with Allergy Season allergy problems will begin to suffer with the coming of this season, as the central valley of California is infamous for being a death pit of allergies.

20080104 08:25:29 nbsp This has been the craziest Davis winter storm I can remember! This morning when I was going to work I thought there was NO WAY I was going to walk from my usual spot thatis a ten minute walk to GBSF.

So, I decided to park as close as possible to my building in the lot and make a run for it. This was after the parking permit machine would not take my cash; it would recognize it because it was so wet. When I got the wind knocked me back against the car.

When I made a break for it I was completely soaked by the time I ran the 50 feet to my building. The building is like a wind tunnel and as I was running, it felt like I was on a really wet and windy treadmill. My hood blew off my coffee was half gone by the time I made it inside. I also called TAPS to let them know why I did not have a permit. They were really nice and said they would get alot of calls like mine and if I was cited, to bring my citation into TAPS this afternoon and pay my $6 then.
