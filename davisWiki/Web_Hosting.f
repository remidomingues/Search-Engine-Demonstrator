Web hosting is a service that allows a website to be accessible via the World Wide Web. Several different such businesses exist in Davis offer web hosting services. Most of these places keep their servers elsewhere, usually in Sacramento (Herakles data center being one example) or in the Bay Area. A few people have servers at Omsoft, who have a datacenter on 5th St.
