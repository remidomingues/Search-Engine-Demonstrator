Comics are a widely accepted form of Procrastinating procrastination, especially by UC Davis university Undergraduate Students students wishing that Finals final exams were never invented. Webcomics are those comics posted online. They fall into a variety of categories, and the most popular tend to have a definite storyline and established characters. They can be simple graphics, spritebased (pixellated), 3D art, mostly text, mostly funny images, Flash cartoons... some artists have even quit their day jobs and spend their entire time working on their webcomics. Some comics are also published in print, such as The California Aggie/Cartoons those in the Aggie and wiki:WikiPedia:Girl_Genius Girl Genius (below).
