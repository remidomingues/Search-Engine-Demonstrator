Webers Yolo Saloon was Davisvilles first saloon. The simple oneroom building owned by George Weber 18351914 was originally located on the northeast corner that is now 1st Street First & B Streets and was later moved to the southwest corner of 2nd Street 2nd & G Streets, which has since become Davis corner of ill repute. At the time of the move around 1875, this prime location was purchased from William Fredrich Dresbach William Dresbach for $400. George Webers Yolo Saloon & Billiard Parlor was a popular retreat until Georges death, though alcohol could not be sold legally until Town History after 1911.

George Augustus Weber came to Davisville from Ohio via the overland Nevada route. Prior to the founding of Davisville, Weber worked for William Dresbach as he saved money to open his saloon. By 1869, he had become a successful businessman and property owner, including farmland at the intersection of Russell Blvd. and County Road 99W. With this to offer, he proposed marriage to the 19year old Ann Hunt that same year and the two settled at 223 C Street until 1880; a large Victorian home on the northeast corner of 2nd Street 2nd & E Streets became the family residence until 1963, when the Brinley Building was constructed on the site. Together the couple had four daughters and Ann was instrumental in establishing a religion Catholic church in Davisville.

Georges second oldest child, Harriet Elisha October 10, 1872December 14, 1961 became librarian of the Davisville Library in 1910, which was then housed in the Buena Vista Hotel; after Yolo County assumed operation of a Hattie Weber Museum newly constructed library, Miss Hattie became the towns first paid librarian and held that position until her retirement in 1955. Georges youngest daughter, Gertrude Frances Weber September 27, 1885March 14, 1961 married Al Green Sam Brinley in 1916. The relative newcomer to Davisville became a Train Station Southern Pacific agent and on his retirement in 1947, established Brinleys Real Estate & Insurance Office which was passed on to his son, John W. Brinley.
