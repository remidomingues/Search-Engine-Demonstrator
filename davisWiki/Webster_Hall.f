Webster Hall is part of Cuarto. Webster has 46 person suites in addition to a few doubles (which are like any other doubles but contain their own bathroom). Like Emerson, it is a three floor building with outdoor hallways facing a pool in the middle. 104 people live on the second and third floors, while 57 live on the first floor. Webster is also home to the Communicating, Learning, Leading Academic Theme Program on its first floor. The building also has a single elevator.

On Websters first floor you will find a small lounge with a T.V. although the T.V. is quite unnecessary as most residents keep their own sets in their suites. Also on the first floor is a Table Tennis table and a piano. There is a couch on the second floor landing as well as elevator access. The third floor common area is a 24hour study room with Internet access.

Overall, a nice intimate place to live.

As with all suite style on campus housing, residents in Webster tend to interact with each other less than in the traditional style dorms. This is due to the ability to stay confined in a suite i.e. no community bathrooms and personal living rooms.

Webster was last remodeled in the 19992000 academic year. It was closed for that academic year for the remodeling.


20060522 20:04:59 nbsp It is true that I dont live in Webster anymore, although what is considered living is debatable. It is certain that I do not sleep there. However, I did live and sleep there during Fall 2005. From what I saw, the large majority of people did not interact with people outside of their respective suites. But in all fairness, there will be antisocial people in any dorm building, its just easier to be antisocial in Cuarto. Users/TusharRawat

20060525 00:26:08 nbsp True, being antisocial is easy in Webster.  However, if you are a gregarious person it is REALLY easy to make friends! Especially when it is hot outside and everyone is at the pool. I made some really great friends here and it is really easy to have parties and to have get togethers in your suites. Also, sharing a bathroom SUCKS. What if you get food poisoning? Do you want to puke all night in a public bathroom? NO! Gross. It is important to make friends in the beginning of the year, though. People become less friendly as time goes on! Users/ValeriePeterson

20061204 23:29:53 nbsp The best way to meet people is holding parties because you have alot of space. Bring in some speakers, food, and soda and bang on random peoples doors and ask them if they are up for a party. If its a friday or saturday night and they are in their rooms it means the are looking to do something. If you host it they will come. Users/DonGibson

20090930 17:46:14 nbsp I lived here as a freshman and the room I was in was smaller than all the other rooms in the suite. Also, nobody decided to clean the smashed fly carcasses on the ceiling. Anyway, as a disgruntled former resident, I feel that I must leave this: http://www.ucdbs.com/dorms Users/hankim
