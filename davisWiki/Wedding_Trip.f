I returned to Davis for a week over the weekend of May 6th, 2011 (plus a few days in each direction) for a bridal shower (Sarah is the Matron of Honor).

I left and came back to Nashville to discover that I am now car free.  Not by intent, but hey, the timing is good, and the synchronicity amused me.  Luckily, although Nashville itself isnt great for being car free, the local neighborhood (Hillsboro Village/West End) is quite nice.



  Street photos/videos  Either a shot in each direction at each intersection of the downtown grid, or an HD video of each block (Davis Streetview!). Got enough to work with.  East Davis, too!
  Meet with a few people. Done

  XChem 194 and her old lab  Sarah wants to revisit the scene of the crime.X
  XInNOut  Really stupid, but we never got a chance to hit one last year, and its now a challenge.X

  Black Bear Diner  Looks like they serve the breakfast of cardiologists (now a maybe, as people have warned about the quality).
  I dont think Ive heard that many complaints about their breakfast... more about the nonbreakfast food.  Ive enjoyed the few breakfasts Ive had there.  Cindys is better, but the portions at Black Bear are an experience. tg
  Queen of Sheba  I love northern African cuisine.  Great lentils.
  Some Thai  which is Sarahs favorite and hard to get (decent) in places where weve been living.
     I recommend Thai Canteen, especially if you like curries... they dont serve family style, but their curries are the best in town. Users/TomGarberson

  Farmers Market, plus a picnic in Central Park (is it held on the Saturday of WEF?)
   Yes, it is! Users/DougWalter
  A Wiki Gatherings Wiki Gathering that weekend would be cool.  Saturday afternoon at 2pm
  Bay Area Rocky Horror  Of course.  Menlo Park showing, midnight on Saturday.


I would enjoy meeting you in the flesh, maybe you should plan on a certain time/ place for a wiki gathering. Users/DagonJones
  See the Wiki Gatherings picnic!
