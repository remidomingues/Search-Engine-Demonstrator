Weepel is (or was) a Weezer cover band comprised of UC Davis students.  They rocked Kleiber Hall along with some some other Davis Music Scene DMS bands of the time.  The great thing about Weepel is that everyone already knows all the lyrics and the songs, so its basically like listening to one of your favorite bands play.
