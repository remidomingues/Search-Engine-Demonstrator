Weevils are a type of beetle. Beetles are of the order Coleoptera and are distinguished by very sclerotized front pair of wings, which are called elytra. Weevils are of the family of Curculionidae, and are distinguished from most other beetles by their downward curving snout.

When asked about the nature of God, wiki:WikiPedia:J._B._S._Haldane J.B.S. Haldane stated, that God must have an inordinate fondness for beetles.

Weevils can be important agricultural pests. Species such as the Rice Water Weevil, Lissorhoptrus oryzophilus and the Alfalfa Weevil, Hypera postica cause a lot of economic damage to crops, primarily in their larval stages, where they cause root or leaf damage. They can make gardening difficult in Davis. Some weevils are also important stored product pests and can pop up in your pantry, eating away at flour and other stored bulk grains.

In Davis, weevils have been spotted in residences during winter, appearing when its raining, possibly trying to find shelter. They look like brown ladybugs and are not that fast.
