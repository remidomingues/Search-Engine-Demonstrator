Welcome Home Doula Services, Inc. (http://whds.org website) is a nonprofit organization offering Birth Doula services, childbirth education classes, pelvic health classes, continuing education for doulas, and placenta encapsulation services throughout the greater Davis/Sacramento area.

A Doula is a trained professional who provides emotional, physical, and informational support to a family during pregnancy, the birth of a child, and the postpartum period. Doulas do not perform clinical tasks, such as fetal heart tone assessment or cervical examinations.
Parents who choose to be supported by a doula during the childbearing year tend to have lower rates of medical interventions during their labors, including assisted deliveries and caesarean births. These parents also tend to feel more bonded with their newborns, and their babies tend to breastfeed longer and more exclusively.

Birth Doula Services through WHDS typically include the following:
  23 Prenatal Visits
  Oncall birth support
  Continuous doula support throughout labor and birth
  2 Postpartum Visits
  Photo/Video of the Labor and Birth

Contact Welcome Home Doula Services for current information on postpartum doula fees.
