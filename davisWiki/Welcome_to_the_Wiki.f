Welcome to the Wiki!  This is intended to be a primer to people who are new to the Wiki to get a handle on what goes on here.  Basically, were a Wiki Community community working together to create and compile anything and everything about Davis Davis, California  especially the little, enjoyable things.  Weve Wiki History been around for awhile and we like to Wiki Gatherings get together and even Davis Wiki Wacky Woo 1 have some fun now and then.

This entire site is maintained by the people who use it: anyone can edit this website.  That means that as soon as you create your (free) account, you can edit this web page or any other one on this entire site.  There are many other people all doing the same thing, all generally friendly and eager to help.  http://wikispot.org/User_Settings?new_user1&from_wikidavis We would love for you to join us.

We hope you will enjoy being a part of the wiki community. Here are some helpful hints that weve found useful for new members:

 1. If something on a page is incorrect, in a comment or not, it is helpful to clarify it in a way that fits with the rest of the page. Editing can do this better than leaving another comment. Please wiki:wikispot:Help with Editing edit if you see something wrong or unclear and help the wiki!
 1. We are all still learning how to make this the best wiki for Davis possible. Please join us in Wiki Community/General Discussion discussion.
 1. The Importance of using your RealName cannot be underestimated.
 1. When you leave a Reviews review or comment keep in mind that it will reflect on you as much as on the business or other page you are reviewing.
 1. Dont feel like you have to create a whole new entry with your first edit. Many editors contribute by doing the tiny fixes and grooming of existing entries. You too can be a Wiki Gnome.
 1. Where to get help with editing  how to use Recent Changes
 1. When editing... Please Remember to Preview
 1. The goal is not to present a Neutral Point of View (NPOV), but rather to reflect that in our community there are MPOV differing opinions and viewpoints.
 1. We tend to keep history around here  departed businesses, pictures of things that are now gone, names of people no longer involved in an organization, etc.  So, please dont delete those, at least without a very good reason.
