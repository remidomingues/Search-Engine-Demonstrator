Note from David Welker, the owner:
Hello! I have lived in Davis since 2007 and established my law office in March 2011. We specialize in bankruptcy. I often meet clients in Sacramento, but since I live in Davis, I am available to meet clients here. I am a Harvard Law graduate, but I charge very competitive prices for those who need to file bankruptcy. Please feel free to check us out!
