Named for Harry R. Wellman, 13th President of the UC System University of California, address(Wellman Hall, 38.541328, 121.751382) (WELLMN) is located on Campus campus across from the west side of The Quad, and is next to Kerr Hall and Hart Hall.  Wellman is home only to UC Davis Classrooms classrooms, featuring no labs and only a few offices. It also features a Computer_Labs computer lab in 102_Wellman room 102, which used to be a study lounge. Practically everyone ends up having classes in Wellman every quarter.  Its one of the most convenient locations to have classes because of the proximity to the Memorial Union. The largest classroom/lecture hall in Wellman is 2 Wellman.

Wellman also features WiFi Hot Spots wireless access.  There is a http://wireless.ucdavis.edu/WellmanMap.htm coverage map on http://wireless.ucdavis.edu.  This balances the fact that most cellphones get no reception in or around the rear of the building.  (At a time now past, The Pit The Pit of Wellman was notorious for this problem.)

Wellman Hall also hosts Davis Anime Club every Wednesday and Thursday from 8:00pm  10:00pm, usually in room 126.

There is a pathway from the basement of Kerr Hall to the basement of Wellman.  This pathway is usually locked from the Wellman>Kerr direction, but not the Kerr>Wellman direction.  This means if youre in Kerr, then you can always get into Wellman.  Any key that opens Kerr Halls lobby door will open the Wellman>Kerr door.

Wellman also hosts DRAGON on the top floor on fridays!

Wellman was remodeled around the year 1999. At that time, the interior decor was redone and updated. Decorative room numbers were added to the doors of the classrooms.

Originally Wellman only had one exterior staircase to the second floor, however due to heavy student traffic a new exterior stairwell was added to the West side of the building around 2000. Previously the second floor balcony was only used for watching the view.

Wellman has a number of DVD players hooked up to huge screens in various classrooms  perfect for watching a movie (provided theres no class in there). Its also possible to route a videogaming video game system through the VCRs.

20041229 16:30:44 nbsp I have some friends who, at least the first couple weeks, would go into wellman at around 9:30 pm and watch a movie. As of now the janitors have never kicked them out (though usually theyd leave by 1:00am). Users/GiladGurantz


20050124 17:37:31 nbsp Ive been in Wellman to watch movies, too.  Its pretty nice since they have the huge screens in the lecture halls.  Users/RohiniJasavala

20060922 15:27:06 nbsp Wellman is wicked for hooking up the PS2 or XBox for some multiplayer giant screen TimeSplitters or Ghost Recon. Users/JohnDudek

20061207 02:04:42 nbsp Yeah, last time I tried to watch a movie in Wellman, me and my friends got booted at 10.  The guy was a real jerk about it too. Users/NicholasKnoblauch

20061207 02:08:13 nbsp Whenever me and my posse is in Wellman past ten the janitors chastise us. It happenes every tuesday. Users/JosephBleckman

20061207 04:21:30 nbsp Anytime between 10 and 10:30. Its the suck. Users/MaxMikalonis

20061207 11:45:06 nbsp My group frequently gets told to leave even when we have the rooms reserved until 11. Users/BrentLaabs

20070410 14:10:02 nbsp yeah, but brent that is because of DRAGON Users/DevinCastellucci

20070410 14:11:00 nbsp they have since stopped doing that to some degree Users/DevinCastellucci

20070520 19:53:35 nbsp I love how they have a 007 room in the basement. Users/Jedron

20070523 02:01:14 nbsp We had our Model UN conference in here last week. Its well suited for it for the most part, but the lecture halls on the ground floor are horrible for caucusing. On the whole, I like Olson better for that purpose. I like the Wellman classrooms better for lectures and actual academics though.  Users/KevinGong

20080904 18:40:00 nbsp In my experience, janitors only try to enforce room reservation time limits during the first months of school.  After that, they just get used to however late your club stays and work around you.  So hang in there for the first few weeks, and it will work out. Users/BrentLaabs

20081207 23:55:35 nbsp they should get new chairs.. all the cusions in 002 are dead and flat. Users/alexlee333

20090122 18:36:46 nbsp The wireless page: http://daviswiki.org/WiFi_Hotspots?actionshow&redirectWireless+Internet says that Wellman has wireless internet, and I assume that this means unencrypted wireless or some wireless aside from the one requiring a student ID to get on. Can anyone confirm/deny this?
Ive never been able to get onto the network from the 2nd story. Users/MasonMurray
  Well, your assumption was wrong; that page was probably written by someone who assumes everyone has a kerberos login.  Users/BrentLaabs

20100201 17:12:34 nbsp this building smells awful (esp. downstairs)...like it flooded and they never cleaned up or something.  Users/randomstudent

20100926 18:03:11 nbsp It always seems to be open, which makes it a great place to grab a Coke on the weekends when youre stuck on campus and the Olson machines broken.  Users/HarrisonM

  Its also a great place to study on the weekends. Feel free to take an entire lecture room to yourself.
