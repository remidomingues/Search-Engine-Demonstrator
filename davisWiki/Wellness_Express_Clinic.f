This walkin clinic handled minor medical conditions and routine examinations. It opened in April 2005 and was located by the pharmacy inside Longs Drugs. At first, the clinic did not bill insurance directly but provided documentation for reimbursement. Later, if your insurance accepted them as a provider, you paid your normal copay.

The company was founded by UC Davis alum Dr. Wesley Chan. The goal wass to reduce the load on Medical Services hospitals by allowing people to receive nonurgent care without going to an emergency room.

20050804 19:27:41 nbsp We went there today; they can do camp, sports and school physicals for kids.  The service was fine, the doctor in attendance had some trouble with the computer system (purely learningcurve stuff) but successfully gave my girls their annual physicals.  They dont have a full collection of vaccines, but they usually do have the most commonly used.  Theres a special on visits for physicals this month (August), regular price $48, special is $40.  Fabulous option for uninsured new residents with kids starting school here. Users/BlancheNonken
