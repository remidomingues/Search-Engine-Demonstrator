< Yours truly on the deck at Hise Hill  Petit Jean River Valley Arkansas.  I became interested in the Davis Wiki through  a Google Search for Morning Glory Spillway funnel shaped spillways. Lake Claiborne in North Central Louisiana, my home for a few years, has a spillway of this type.  Im interested in the Wiki concept.

Heres a pic scan, old and faded, of the Lake Claiborne funnel spillway.  Not quite as artistically awesome as your Morning Glory but more user friendly.  A visitors walkway enables one to observe this spillway from closeup.  It also attracted thrill seekers from the opposite end when low water flow permitted entrance therebeen there, done that  thrilling  particularly the cottonmouth water moccasins.
