Wendys is a fast food restaurants restaurant known for their square Hamburgers burgers, frosties and fries.  They also have fairly good fast food salads. The burgers are square and are made fresh rather than from frozen patties like most other fast food burgers.   Almost all of the original burger chains founded in the early 1920s, like White Castle, serve square burgers.  Wendys burger (and original menu) is based on wiki:wikipedia:Kewpee Hamburgers, which  being founded in 1923  are typically square.  Square patties also allow better use of the grill space, as they can be tiled next to each other.

After three flips, they chuck burgers into the chili, so chili from later in the day tends to be meatier than a chili from early in the day (plus you know your burger wasnt sitting under a heat lamp).  Contrary to urban legend, they dont use burgers that fell on the floor.  The health department would frown on that.  Grab some chili with your meal, take it home and stick it in the fridge.  The next day, make some spaghetti, chop some onions and use it to make chilimac.  With loads of beans and meat, its a perfect chili for chilimac.  Drop some shredded cheddar (or sour cream if youre feeling New Englandy) atop it if you want to be fancy.

Wendys has recently introduced the new Daves Hot N Juicy which is available with 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 lb. of beef.

Its all about the 99¢ menu  99¢ nuggets, 99¢ fries, 99¢ frosties... you get the picture.

Frosties come in several flavors. The original Frosty is actually a mixture of half vanilla and half chocolate. A vanilla Frosty was later introduced. They later added Frosty Shakes which can be consumed using a straw. Wendys now has a Wild Berry Frosty Parfait and Wild Berry Frosty Shake. The parfait is made with real berries. There is also Wild Berry Tea. In addition, there is also the Caramel Apple Frosty Parfait with real apples and an Oreo Parfait.

In 2008, the parent company of Arbys bought Wendys. The merger with 2 competing restaurant brands was not profitable and Arbys was sold in Summer 2011. Wendys/Arbys Group changed names to Wendys Company since they are now only focused on Wendys restaurants. Wendys is once again independent.

The Wendys location in Davis closed and the building is now a Carls Jr.

 The Finger 

A woman claimed to have found a severed human finger http://www.sfgate.com/cgibin/article.cgi?f/n/a/2005/03/28/state/n151302S81.DTL in their chili at a Wendys in the Bay Area.  The police investigated and appear to have determined that the woman was performing a scam trying to extort money from Wendys.  After a warrant was issued to search her house, the woman has dropped all charges and she does not want to go to court.  It was revealed that she has sued other restaurants (including El Pollo Loco), a car dealership (who sold her a car whose wheel fell off), and several sexual harassment suits.

On 4/22/05, the woman was arrested in Las Vegas at her home. The finger was finally traced back to a friend of her husbands who injured himself in an industrial accident last December. DNA tests have determined that the finger is his and he has admitted that he gave the finger to her.   Here are http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7594873/ details.

On 9/9/05, the couple involved pled guilty and face ten and thirteen years in jail.  According to the court, Wendys sales have dropped two and a half million dollars due to their actions.

On 1/18/06, they were jailed for nine years each.

The Wendys in Davis will refuse to serve you if you joke about finding a finger in their chili.  While that may seem severe, consider that there have been times that they have been tormented about it via the drive through window.  They will politely ask you to leave as they are declining you service. NOTE: according to http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7594873/ msnbc.com as a result of this womans claims, sales at Wendys Northern California stores have fallen off significantly, enough so that there have been layoffs and reduced hours at some locations. No wonder they are a bit touchy about it.

 Closure 

The locations in Davis and Woodland were closed suddenly in June 2012. Currently the only comment made by the company claims it as strictly a business decision. This is curious as both locations had full employed staff and had been, to all appearances, doing well as businesses. The Sacramento Bee http://www.sacbee.com/2012/06/28/4594908/wendysrestaurantsinwoodland.html article on the subject revealed little more information. Further adding to speculation were recent events involving contractors/construction workers of some sort being housed at the nearby La Quinta hotel, as well as statements regarding opening up at different locations in the area. These, combined with the abrupt nature of the closures, may imply problems with the buildings themselves.

Both stores were corporate

Upon further investigation there are many issues involving the http://www.havredailynews.com/news/story425203.html corporation vs. franchise owners. As Franchise owners continue to try to cut cost whenever and however they may, Wendys corporate hits them hard if it costs food quality or violates any of the Wendys International policies. More closures have included:
http://www.havredailynews.com/news/story425203.html Yakima, http://www.tricityherald.com/2012/01/31/1807948/restaurantscloseinkennewick.html Kennewick, and Walla Walla Washington
http://tomsebourn.blogspot.com/2012/05/wendysclosureadstolistofchains.html Eureka, CA Made even stranger since it was the last Fast Food chain still open in Humboldt County.

There have also been closures of approximately 600 other stores in at least seven other states, including the original Wendys location in http://beta.wosu.org/capturecolumbus/originalwendyslocationoneastbroadstreet/ Columbus, Ohio (closed March, 2007) over the past 5 years.

It is quite odd since Wendys sales in their 6k plus stores exceeded those of Burger King in 2011 in their 12k plus stores for the first times in the franchises history making Wendys the number two most eaten fast food, right behind McDonalds.  Apparently, this is not enough to justify costs to the franchise owners.

A quick Google Search, specifically looking at franchiseowner related articles, indicates the majority of the closures are most likely related to the high cost of upfitting the restaurants. Every 20 years, Wendys corporate requires the upfits in their chains, and the costs average around $1.5 million per store. Since 77% of the Wendys in this country are franchised owned, the majority of them are choosing to close their lowest profit stores rather than pay the extremely high costs of the upfits. Some franchise chains, including BZB, owners of the stores in Washington and four other states, have chosen to close all of the stores and sell of the properties to the highest bidders.

Alternately  and it should be clearly understood that this is a rumor  it has been stated in local talk radio that word at a local coffee shop has it that the franchise owner was doing something related to dealing drugs out of the location(s).  If you know any facts, please edit this to confirm.

20081022 13:40:30 nbsp ummmmm. i hate to say this, but I ordered a Caesar chicken salad...i only ever order that or the chicken nuggets. but this particular time i found a bug in my salad. I dont know if it was a nat. I was so lucky that i eat slowly, right before i was going to put it in my mouth i saw something black and it as a dead bug indeed. I cannot eat there anymore i think that there are like bugs flying around in the back and they leave something that they are making for u open and boom its in there. perhaps not really their fault, but still. its a pity, i enjoyed their chicken nuggets.
