Im majoring in Biology with emphasis in Cellular and Molecular Biology. I miss the people in Kemper Hall because I am no longer majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. Programming all night just isnt what it use to be anymore.

One of the interesting things about me is that Im from wiki:la:Front Page Los Angeles. I know there are LA haters out there. Two of my own professors were talking trash about LA. Stop being jealous!

Im a remnant of the few surviving people still playing Starcraft. I might stop when Starcraft II comes out.

Im Chinese. My mom is from Gongdong and my dad is from Hong Kong, so they have different dialects of Cantonese. And Im the only child, but not spoiled.

My interests are music, computer stuff, and the occasional programming, just not hardcore programming that Ive associated with long nights of homework. Right now Im tryng to correct my weird accent and Im learning music in my free time.

20090729 01:24:05 nbsp Cool. When changes like that pop up on Recent Changes they get noticed and it is usually better to ask the person making the edits what is going on, as there may be a totally reasonable reason for it. For those other times the edit gets undone. Users/JasonAller

20090729 01:27:06 nbsp I still dont know how youre able to tell without looking at different versions of the page. I think you have a script that compares old and new updates and tells you which words are changed. Users/WengFF

20090729 01:33:46 nbsp Recent Changes shows the changes made clearly in yellow and green. Users/JasonAller

20090729 01:38:24 nbsp Its built into the wiki so everybody can watch for hijinks like somebody altering somebody elses words.  Just part of that whole open thing.  Quite a few people read the updates. wiki:gnome:Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
