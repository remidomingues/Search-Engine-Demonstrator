20111124 18:40:23 nbsp What did you order at Taste of Thai?  I only get stuff with tofu rather than meat, and they do the tofu superbly.  If you ever go back try the Pad Khee Mao.  Definitely one of the better dishes they offer.  I still prefer Thai Nakorn for curries but ToT has better noodle dishes and stir fry. Users/OliviaY

20111130 13:09:26 nbsp Wes, I am so sorry to hear about your friend.  Please accept my deepest condolences.   Users/CovertProfessor

20111130 16:01:00 nbsp I get the idea that youve had a fairly rough time of late, in terms of tragedy befalling people youve known.  My thoughts and best wishes are with you. Users/JabberWokky

20111130 16:03:47 nbsp Likewise, Wes, my condolences. Users/TomGarberson

20111211 21:37:33 nbsp Yeah, but thats part of the problem thats cropped up in the past.  I figured Id ask nicely before somebody jumped all over them.  Im also content to simply ask until theres an actual issue. Users/JabberWokky

20120101 21:08:18 nbsp Hey Wes, any thoughts on how to tie Ban the editors into the greater wiki scheme?  Maybe in Wiki Community? Users/TomGarberson

20120102 13:26:29 nbsp There are some wiki folklore entries out there.  They are a bit hard to cross link.  Some got moved into Wiki Community, while others kind of sit out there, hidden gems. Users/JabberWokky
  I like the page.  Its thoughtprovoking.  Worth linking up, imo.   Users/CovertProfessor
   I like it too. Im just saying they tend to be less obvious because they are somewhat hard to link.  Probably a good thing for some of them, too. jw

20120123 10:48:05 nbsp Wow, thats an obnoxious driver.  Back when I delivered pizzas (summer after freshman year, a very long time ago), I forgot things or brought the wrong pizza a couple of times.  Im fairly sure I always immediately drove back to the store and got what they needed, and only asked for payment when the delivery was complete.  The driver loses out on some money, since theyre making two trips while only getting paid for one (at Round Table, we got $1 per stop to cover gas/maintenance/whatever, since we used our own cars)... but its pretty unusual that its not the drivers fault.  I suppose someone might make the wrong pizza, or put the order number on the wrong box, but thats a far less likely explanation, and you should still check. Users/TomGarberson Users/TomGarberson

20120711 15:00:47 nbsp Great addition to Wendys.  I didnt realize Wendys had overtaken BK, or that it was having those troubles. Users/TomGarberson

20121114 15:54:01 nbsp Earlier today I addressed a comment to Andrew on the Talk page for 24/7 soliciting his response to your comment.  Just to prevent any confusion or doubt, I trust your word completely on the 24/7 stuff.  I phrased it the way I did in hopes that Andrew will present a nondefensive explanation so that it can be added to the page and increase the amount of information.  It wasnt intended to cast any doubt on your word or anything like that. Users/TomGarberson
