##Image(wes.jpg,thumbnail,200,right,Me after hiking up a mountain and taking a selfportrait with the wind blowing my hair hitherandyon please dont tease me about the quality of the picture or the length of this caption)
Wes Hardaker has been in Davis for far too long.  He was born here.  Ok, technically Woodland because Davis didnt have a birthing center at the time.  He did leave at one point, but somehow got sucked back.  Its the Front Page wiki that keeps him here now :)

He has a brain dump, err...  http://pontifications.hardakers.net/ blog as well.

He owns Captured On Earth Photography and spends as much time as possible taking pictures of the world at large.

20070309 15:45:10 nbsp Hey, Wes.  You would likely get much more response if you filed those bugs at http://projectsycamore.org, the software wiki.  Theres about to be a big upgrade for the Davis Wiki software, so its quite possible the things youre finding have already been fixed. Users/JabberWokky
 Didnt want to do that until I found exactly what it was.  Wes

20070309 16:57:09 nbsp It seems the bikepath closure page is indeed currently useful...  Thanks for the update. Users/DavidGrundler

20070327 16:25:31 nbsp It looks like both the second and third pictures are orb weavers. Users/DavidGrundler

  Hmm...  could be, but the second one is almost entirely black.  the patterning is about right though so I suspect youre right.

20070920 14:54:32 nbsp Hi Wes, Thanks for helping me edit my comment. I hope it wasnt too tedious. Have fun at Dos! Users/AmyLee

20070928 08:26:27 nbsp Ive tried ulng the davisbikeloopwhole.gpx file both to my own gps and to geocaching.com to see whats along the Loop, but the file doesnt seem to have any points/route info. The .kmz file works fine, however. Do you happen to have the route info still, and also would you mind if Id made the route a public one on geocaching? Users/KevinChin

20080126 09:04:21 nbsp The Yolo Bypass Wildlife Area/Talk issues you raised are the same ones I had until I realized the guy who did it knew what he was doing: check the edit log for both entries... we had lumped everything kind of together, while he split them out into two distinct things.  Im inclined to believe him that they are distinct (overlapping) entities, as he is personally/professionally attached to one. Users/JabberWokky

20080126 20:39:50 nbsp I dont see any duplication.  The writeups and photos are different... one is about the 16,000 acre Yolo Bypass Wildlife Area, the other about the ...

ah HA!  I was laboring under the impression that the Vic Fazio Yolo Wildlife Are was a subset section of the Yolo Bypass Wildlife Area.  Theres not much duplication, but if they are indeed the same area with different names (and possibly funding, etc), then youre right, they should probably be one entry with a redirect and a note on why two different names are used for the same thing.  Of course, they could also be two very distinct groups with cocaretaker roles for the same physical land, in which case two entries may make sense.   (I just woke up from a nap; I think this needs a clear head and a bit of research to work out). Users/JabberWokky

20080317 02:00:13 nbsp A buddy of mine has a portable hole, and a complete set of putters and drivers etc, you should disc sometime! Users/StevenDaubert

20080317 09:21:44 nbsp Hey, saw your post about disc golf. I played it all the time  back home, but havent found anywhere good to do so here. I would totally be up for it! Users/BrandonBarrette

20080403 11:25:30 nbsp I think the person may well be originally from WC (the whois says so), but his current information on his main website (http://jackery.com/ Jackery.com) says hes living in Davis. Users/JabberWokky

20080406 13:36:05 nbsp Have you played Disc Golf at the course in Elk Grove? I noticed Disc Golf baskets in the park while running a race a few weeks ago. Curious if its worth it to check out. I recently was in Oxford Circle Park and saw the course there... Wow, pretty sad that Davis cant have a decent course. They should be able to make a nice course on the north Covell Greenbelt, that would be amazing. Users/BrandonBarrette

20080407 18:40:57 nbsp Ok, I take that back... here is the course, http://www.yourcsd.com/parks/facts/pdf/DiscGolf.pdf, I think ours might be better, although this looks good for long distance driving practice. Users/BrandonBarrette

20080728 09:18:01 nbsp I had the same experience at Mace Market.  I couldnt believe it.  Check out my experience at http://abramnichols.com/blog/?p1310#comments.  My wife and I made a pact not to shop there again, no matter how convenient it was! Users/DannyFoster

20091120 08:08:20 nbsp Hi Wes  Don Lotter here.  I posted about developing the Realtime Developing Events discussion area on DavisWiki.  I grew up next door to your dad and Warren, copying all of Warrens collecting hobbies and trying to keep from denting your dads cars with our baseballs.  Im moving overseas in a couple of weeks, so if you think that discussion area is a good thing maybe you could pursue it. There have been a number of times I wanted to know what was going on (helicopter, sirens, explosion, gunshots etc.) but couldnt go anywhere online to find out. Maybe the discussion area could link to Twitter.  Hey, what if Neil Young showed up at a bar and started playing?
Best,
Don Lotter Users/dwlotter

20100128 21:43:19 nbsp I think its a long list of prices that are the core of the entrys content that is the problem (i.e., entries that are basically a commercial flier), not a simple mention of pricing within an entry whose focus is about the subject. Users/JabberWokky

20100302 12:57:42 nbsp Theres no Canadian Horses.  That should help you out.  Also:  Nice photos! Users/JabberWokky

20100522 10:46:11 nbsp nice job on the mystery picture, btw it turns out I know your mom Laurel.  We talked about you many months ago when we were talking about geocaching.  She told me you are yamar.  I saw her last name and asked her if she knew a Wes Hardaker, sure enough you were her son. Users/DagonJones

20100624 00:28:22 nbsp Actually, Wes Hardaker looks about my age and at the time I was born in Davis there was a birthing center at Sutters old location in West Davis. Im not disputing the fact that he was born in Woodland Im just making sure history is written correctly.   Users/MichaelJanzen

20100624 12:06:39 nbsp I am, admittedly, going on what Ive heard.  I dont have sources to site about when the birthing center appeared :/ Users/WesHardaker

20100726 22:36:44 nbsp I actually rode by the Hattie Webber museum when I was looking for your last mystery picture, I just did not check the west wall. Users/DagonJones

20100910 07:47:30 nbsp Ha!  I like the featured page! Users/JabberWokky

20110407 20:50:05 nbsp Seriously.  Im going to slat you in the face if you dont stop changing the photo as Im pointing out details.  ;)   (Edit:  Eh?  Why am I seeing three different images.  Ah, HA!!!  You are devious, Mr. H.)  Users/JabberWokky

     Wes:  This is Bob Miller (the eye doctor).  Im not sure how to get a hold of you through this Wiki link (excuse my infantile knowledge of the medium!), but Im having a problem with Wiki, and not sure how to deal with it.  Your input would be MOST appreciated!  Write me at rbmiller@ucdavis.edu OR my personal cell:  5302197575
Thanks VERY much! Users/AdvancedValleyEye

20110503 10:46:34 nbsp This might sound odd, given the subject matter  and even stranger in that I raise rodents  but thats a really beautiful photo of the snake eating the rat. Thats the kind of everyday nature scene that I love walking across and watching for awhile (the less devoury ones too).  Users/JabberWokky

20110503 16:38:09 nbsp Thought those looked familiar to me... actually shocked I guessed correctly. Users/WesP

20110515 10:52:11 nbsp I like the Highway 50 photo a lot! Users/TomGarberson

20110712 20:46:00 nbsp No, it was in response to Users/KimWong Kim Wongs Page. She had created the links for each, but since no info was available for any of them they were just random names floating in the wikispace... I created the pages with seeds so that others might actually add info to them.  Users/WesP

20120116 10:04:52 nbsp Hi Wes, I am very soon going to add some updated info about Explorit now that it functioning again in the Mace Ranch House at 3141 5th Street.  You have a photo of the 2nd Street building that has now been handed over to Explorits Lender and I wonder if you would edit your caption to say that Explorit was in this building from 2006 through 2010 but is now in Mace Ranch Community Park at 3141 5th Street.  This will  make it clear that visitors should not go to the 2nd Street location  and that the 5th Street location is still alive! Many people seem to think that Explorit has gone away completely! Many thanks, Anne Users/AnneHance
