20090427 17:22:59 nbsp I have been a patient of Dr. Honbo for about a year and a half now, and so far the experience has been great!  The staff are all really nice and he definitely knows what he is talking about and always seems to have a smile on his face!  I would definitely recommend Dr. Honbo to anyone.  He also accepts SHIP insurance, which is great! Users/LolaTorney

20100614 14:48:20 nbsp Dr. Honbo is very patient, very knowledgeable and thus far an extremely pleasant person to have my face drilled off by. Seriously, his staff are extremely courteous and understanding, and Ive been treated with nothing but the utmost respect since the moment I walked in the door for my first cleaning. The woman behind the front counter is exceedingly nice. I had a a ton of questions about using the SHIP health insurance, combining that with private insurance purchased by my father, how much I would have to pay, when I had to pay it, how I was supposed to navigate the swamp of insurance claims, what my coverage was, and she was more than happy to talk with me on the phone and in person. Not only is she helping me get my procedures paid for by both plans, shes getting preapproval from the insurance companies to make sure I can pay for the work I need done. All in all, Im really glad I chose these guys for my dentistry needs while Im attending UC Davis, they rock. EDIT: Ask Dr. Honbo about how to study for Organic Chemistry. He has secret techniques!
