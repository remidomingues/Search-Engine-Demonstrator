>__West Coast Coop Conference 2010__<
What is WestCo?
WestCo is an annual, weekendlong gathering of cooperatives and coopers on the West Coast. Local coopers host and organize the conference each year, with support from national http://www.nasco.coop North American Students of Cooperation (NASCO) staff members. The conference mostly revolves around housing coops, but can be expanded to other forms of coops as well. Coopers from up and down the West Coast get together (last year from Santa Barbara to Portland!), providing an opportunity to strengthen the cooperative community through skill share, communication, and fun. WestCo 2009 was hosted by the coops in Eugene, OR and the year before the event took place in Santa Cruz, CA. To get a sense of what its all about, check out the awesome events, workshops, and photos from Westco 09:
