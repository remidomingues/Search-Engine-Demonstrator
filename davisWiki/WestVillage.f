20110211 13:40:19 nbsp I think what William is trying to say (OK, not really) is Welcome to the Wiki.  Due to WikiSpots agreement with the IRS as a nonprofit corporation, it cannot be used for promotional purposes by businesses.  That means any information needs to be informational in nature.  The Regular Events page also really isnt the place for that.  It might be appropriate on the apartment page.  Please take some time to read over the Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner pageitll clarify things and shed light on some of the more common wiki pitfalls for business owners and representatives.

Please also have a look at the Identity page.  When you signed up for an account, it asked you to please use your RealName.  Using an organizational account name separates you from the community and gets in the way of establishing identity.  Anonymity is, I hate to say it, at the root of a lot of the problem editing that goes on here.  Even something like BobAtWestVillage would be a big improvement, although its easy enough to use your RealName and identify your affiliation on your User Page. Users/TomGarberson

20110211 13:51:08 nbsp Totally understand!  Im happy to use my name.  This is all very new to me, so I am trying to learn the rules.   Users/WestVillage
