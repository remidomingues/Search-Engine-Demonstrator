The West Davis Neighborhood Market Association is a group mentioned by David J. Thompson in his http://davisvanguard.blogspot.com/2008/01/planningcommissiondeniespetitionto.html posting on The Peoples Vanguard of Davis in January 2008. How it is organized, how one would join, whether or not theres a secret handshake, and whether they plan other manifestations on the Web are unknown at this time.

Some (all??) of the same people became involved in http://groups.dcn.org/dang Davis Advocates for Neighborhood Groceries (DANG), and they advocated against changes proposed by the landlord at Westlake Plaza. As of January 2010, there is a Westlake Market market in Westlake Plaza.
