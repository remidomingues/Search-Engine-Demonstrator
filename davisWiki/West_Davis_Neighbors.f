Describe West Davis Neighbors here.
Some Village Homes residents were members of the West Davis Neighbors group opposing the West Village project due to traffic concerns on Russell Blvd. (where the universitys project would have had all traffic enter and exit). Widening  Russell Blvd. was not feasible due to the historic walnut trees. Opposition to the project came from many residents along Russell, and after some contentious meetings the university agreed to move entrance and egress to LaRue Rd.  One of the leaders of West Davis Neighbors was Kim Stanley Robinson. There were also suggestions of making a bike and emergency vehicle only connection from West Village to Russell Boulevard, but it was also opposed even though the West Davis fire station is northwest of West Village on Arlington.
