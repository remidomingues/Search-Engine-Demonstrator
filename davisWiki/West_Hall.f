West Hall was one of the three original dorms dormitories (with North Hall and South Hall) on the Campus UC Davis campus, and was built in 1914.  It was a mens dorm. Both it and the Recreation Center occupied the current site of the Memorial Union MU until 1953, when it was razed to make way for the MU. This commemorative plaque is located at the foot of the MU courtyards west wall.

During the Postwar period, a group of students from West Hall were involved in activism to improve campus facilities that had been neglected during World War II.  They were involved in a World War II covert act of legislator education that assisted in the school receiving much needed improvements.
