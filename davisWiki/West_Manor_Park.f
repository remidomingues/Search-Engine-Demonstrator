This is the place to go if you want to have a BBQ with all your friends that live in the nearby apartment complexes. It is part of the West Manor neighborhood. It appears that the citys open container ordinance does not apply to this park.

  Im told that this park looks the way it does because it was designed by Landscape Architecture students.  Users/NickSchmalenberger
