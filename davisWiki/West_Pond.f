Address(West Pond, 38.55728, 121.782721) is a stormwater detention basin located east of Lake Blvd. and north of Arlington Blvd.  The City of Davis manages the pond to support an array of Town Fauna wildlife. It is a wonderful place to watch Herons & Egrets egrets, Canada Geese and Friends of West Pond/Birds others.   The Bike Paths bike path on the eastern edge is nice, with several decks for viewing the ponds. There are a number of benches along the path, allowing passersby to sit back and enjoy the view.  A section of the path has some large bumps.

A companion to the Northstar Ponds are the delightful West Ponds, located in west Davis. The best way to get there is to go south on Denali Drive from Covell Boulevard, and turn west on Isle Royale Lane, to where there is a small grassy park. From here, there is a path extending along the entire eastern side of the ponds. The west and north sides are not accessible. Egrets and various species of ducks are usually here. Upon occasion, in winter, hooded mergansers have been seen. One of the ponds greatest claims to fame among birders is that an eastern phoebe was found here in the winter of 1993, for a first record for the county. The Yolo Audubon Society is a cosponsor of these ponds.

 Birds Sometimes Seen Here
  Canada Geese: Youre guaranteed to see at least one of these here any day of the year.
  Ducks Mallard Duck: Commonly seen year round though not as abundant or noisy as the geese.
  Herons & Egrets:
 a) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Egret Great Egrets are longlegged longnecked white birds can get over three feet tall.
 b) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Heron Green Herons are common yet reclusive, so you feel special when you see one (plus theyre neat looking little herons). Formerly called Greenbacked Heron, they have a beautiful rusty front.
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_Duck Woodduck: Arguably the most beautiful Davis residents, these shy ducks have homes built just for them around the pond.  (Since people dont like dead trees much, few natural tree cavities exist anymore; so people now build woodduck boxes to hang in appropriate locations.)
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooded_Merganser Hooded Merganser: Several reported sightings, see photo below.  We also sometimes see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Merganser Common Merganser.
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Phoebe Eastern Phoebe: The first recorded EASTERN Phoebe in Yolo County was observed at West Pond.  We frequently, however, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Phoebe Black Phoebe.

20130114 20:32:33 nbsp The name of the Pond itself per the city map book is West Area Drainage Pond traditionally shortened to West Pond.  The pond near 113 and Covell is called Evergreen Pond. West of Lake Blvd. is Stonegate Lake (private) and the Stonegate Retention Basin.

The greenbelt name is reflected in the landscape plans as  Aspen Stonegate East Pond Edge Greenbelt and is shortened to Aspen Pond Greenbelt. West Pond is welldescribed on daviswiki. Can someone please add the Aspen Pond Greenbelt to the list of greenbelts in West Davis? Thanks! JE Ryan for the Friends of West Pond Users/JER
