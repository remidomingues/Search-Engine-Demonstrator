West Village is a campus neighborhood located on UC Davis land adjacent to the core campus in Davis, California. It is a mixeduse community that will eventually include student housing, single family homes, retail, and recreation facilities as well as a community college, the Sacramento City College Davis Center, which is part of the Los Rios Community College District. It is designed to enable faculty, campus staff staff and students to live near campus, take advantage of  transportation options, and participate in campus life.

The Developers development and implementation of UC Davis West Village is a collaboration between the university and a private developer, West Village Community Partnership LLC (WVCP), led by Carmel Partners of San Francisco with their joint venture partner Urban Villages of Denver, Colorado. The total Phase 1 cost is around $280 million, of which UC Davis invested approximately $17 million to bring utilities and infrastructure to the site. The university will recoup this investment through a surcharge placed on resident utility bills.

Students and staff began moving in to The Ramble and Viridian apartments in August 2011. Model singlefamily homes are scheduled to open in Spring 2012 and home sales will also begin in 2012.

September 2011 movein dates were delayed and residents were compensated with stays at the Hilton, Visa gift cards or free TVs. Construction is still taking place as of 11/2/2011

 History 
The West Village Master Plan was approved by the UC Regents in November, 2003. Land use map of Phase 1 can be viewed http://westvillage.ucdavis.edu/imagegallery/UCDavisWestVillageLandUse.jpg/view here.

The West Davis Neighbors neighborhood associations organization sued to stop the project. After the suit was dismissed the first time, the group appealed in 2005 with the same http://www.davisenterprise.com/articles/2005/12/06/news/025new1.txt result. Because of the Neighbors opposition, there is no direct connection with Russell Boulevard for the development, and it is much less likely for the new Westlake Market to have customers from there.

In November 2006, the Regents approved the business terms of the ground lease with West Village Community Partners and gave the goahead for the first phase of UC Davis West Village  to begin.

In August 2008, UC Davis and its development partner, West Village Community Partnership LLC (developers from San Francisco and Denver), signed the ground lease, clearing the way for the design and construction phase of West Village Footnote(UC Davis News & Information http://www.news.ucdavis.edu/search/news_detail.lasso?id8772 University, Developer Sign Ground Lease for West Village 20080905).  In December, the 113 Orchard was cut down and large pipes were installed underground, presumably as infrastructure for the development.

Groundbreaking for the project took place in August, 2009, amid some http://westvillage.ucdavis.edu/news/westvillagemediacoverage/ fanfare.

Groundbreaking for the site, which is west of Highway 113 between Hutchison Drive and Russell Boulevard, is planned for 2008, and the first occupancy could be in late 2009. That sounds extremely optimistic to me, but this is the most recent update I can find online.

20110929 20:21:47 nbsp Ok so I live in West Village and I need to rant. It is great place to live and all but it all seems like a bit of green wash to me. If they wanted a sustainable community why didnt they look at Village Homes or the Domes for inspiration? The gardens are not very well thought out in terms of water usage and plant diversity. I appreciate that it is probably reclaimed water but that doesnt mean water plants with automatic sprinklers for several hours at a time and in the hottest part of the day (to the point where the grass areas are soggy to walk, and the paths get more water than the plants do). They have mulch in some areas around plants but then not in others, where it could definitely use it. I would have LOVED it if they planted some productive trees around the place and in fact I was thinking about doing some guerrilla gardening around the place  just some perennial herbs maybe. This is something that shouldve been factored into their ‘sustainable’ design concept to begin with.
I understand that it is completely solar powered but why do ground lights around the trees need to be on 24 hours a day?
Also, when we moved in, they didnt provide recycling bins even though it seems to me that almost all of peoples waste when they are moving is cardboard boxes and other recyclables. They still havent really provided recycling bins, someone just sticky taped some cardboard on the front of 2 bins that says recycling, probably because of how much cardboard was being thrown in the 4 general waste bins they have provided. Just something that bothers me…
I would like to see composting as well if we are going to pretend to be sustainable, green and cutting edge. There is already a ton of infrastructure in Davis for it.
It just feels very corporate to me and I wish that maybe some of the environmental design departments or something at UC Davis had more involvement in the project.
There are a lot of positives about West Village. 24 hour gym and study area, a swimming pool, spa, sand volleyball court, game area, wireless internet. It’s expensive, but everything is included. The staff are super nice and helpful. The apartment is really nice but you can tell they rushed it a bit. There is still some construction going on and they start really early in the morning and sometimes work until super late at night. The apartment was dirty when I moved in, there are a few scratches on the floor, etc. as if the construction workers don’t have a clean up crew. I appreciate the effort and concept but it could be taken a few steps further. I don’t want to be too harsh on them because it is just getting off the ground and they are still getting organized but my hope is that they will start to take these things into consideration because they have a lot to live up to. I’ll certainly be doing my part to make them act more “sustainable”.

20111002 23:20:59 nbsp Ok, so a little follow up. I noticed that some of the sprinklers around my apartment were on around 12pm today and wasnt so bothered by it until I went for a walk to the study/computer area at around 11pm (dont get me started with the people printing 100 pages at a time, leaving no ink or paper for anyone else) and the sprinklers were still on! The trees they were watering were flooded and much of the water was flowing into the gutter. I mentioned before that Im sure much of it is reclaimed water but it is just unnecessary. I found the tap and turned it off anyway, which Ive done before when water was flooding the carpark, and Ill continue to do it. I want to speak to the person responsible for the garden but havent spotted them yet.
Otherwise, I want to repeat that they are great apartments, I love living here and Im at least glad that something like this is being built. Hopefully it becomes mainstream and it only gets better with time. Users/ConsciousConsumer

Did anyone go to the pep rally seriously? what a waste of rent money again! Everything was a disappointment. LIke only 20 people showed up and there was Gunrock shooting free West Village Swag/Tshirts into the grand stands. I saw everything it was quite elaborate. They got food catered from the Davis Grad, cotton candy, popcorn, a jumping house, huge big balloons (those half dome thingys), grand stands, Gunrock, the UCD dance/cheer teams. Wow, they must have spent like $10,000 or more on the entire event. I saw ENTIRE boxes of foam fingers just sitting there, unused. Even the raffle tickets were elaborate. Not the ordinary roll chunk of raffle tickets. It was high quality full color glossy 4x4 index cards. It was quite ridiculous. Those cost like $1.50 to print each. And also not to mention all the Viridian key chains and pens they were giving out. I guess the Viridian isnt selling so well, with its $1800 rents and such. I dont know where the West Village team is getting these silly ideas...wow..why cant they put their energy into solving our internet and other miscellaneous problems, instead of planning these stupid parties that no one goes to. They also spent money on a full half page AD in The Aggie.

  They could put the money they spend on stuff into reducing rents for students. I saw someone mention they are offering free rent for the rest of 2011 on craigslist for the Ramble. They must be desperate.  OS
  That sounded unlikely (especially since the Ramble is fully rented), so I checked.  Theres no such posting on Craigslist.  Theres also no posting at all on Craigslist for Veridian, although I keep hearing that Veridian is only about 40% occupied.  However, I dont know if that number is accurate.   Users/IDoNotExist
  This ad from uloop advertises 2 months (or the rest of 2011) of free rent for Viridian: http://ucdavis.uloop.com/housing/view.php/3847433/9582br1095sqftViridianApartments Users/argyle
  Ahhh...OK.  Id read the statement above as free rent, not free for two months.  :)  I think theyve been offering 2 months free at Veridian for quite a while, as they havent been able to fill the complex at the rates theyve been charging.
  My bad for the poor wording. I thought it would have been strange to have adds on craigslist. Uloop makes more sense I guess  OS

20120105 22:44:18 nbsp Anybody else have outlets failing all over the place? Im down 4 at last count... Users/ConsciousConsumer

20120416 12:21:30 nbsp I really like living here, however I kind of just moved in because it was one of the only places close to campus that still had places up for lease without a waiting list. I really love the gym, its not too crowded around 7 at night or early in the morning, which is nice. Its also great because you dont have to go all the way to the ARC and theres a vending machine and RedBox like DVD rental machine inside the gym. I had a maintainance issue that was addressed almost immediately.

My only issue is the high rent. I understand, its a pretty fancy place and I wouldnt mind paying $700 for one of the two bedrooms, but $986 is way too much, especially for an undergrad. On top of that, expecting to pay for parking is even worse. Several apartments in the area, like the Colleges, etc have free parking for their Residents. Also since their parking lot is relatively empty, I dont think offering free parking would be that much of a hindrance. I would really like to renew, but alas Im not due to the expensive rent which none of my friends are willing to pay.  Users/DeeptiNallapaneni

20120831 20:16:15 nbsp After a year of living in West Village, the best way to sum up its current state is that its all style and no substance. In other words: eyecandy. Its hard to imagine how businesses could ever be viable in such an isolated community.

I cant wait to check out the model single family homes (they ought to be really nice), whenever they get built... then Ill gawk at their price tags and joke about how (talented) UC Davis staff and faculty will never be able to afford them. Users/Roarasaurus

20130203 12:17:14 nbsp This Sac Bee article pretty much sums up my incredibly negative experience with the West Village Apartments http://www.sacbee.com/2013/02/02/5159639/westvillagecomplexhasyetto.html Users/AnnaV
  I see two references to this page in the article... interesting that the SacBee acknowledges the existence of the Davis Wiki when the Enterprise wont.  I guess what would be even better would be if West Village would read the page and make improvements!  cp

20130903 06:06:09 nbsp Dont move in here! Avoid horrible experiences. No wonder Sacramento Bee states Despite those luxuries, West Village has had a hard time keeping tenants, with about 50 percent of them declining to renew their leases in 2012, not including those who graduated. Citywide, the average renewal rate is closer to 70 percent The luxuries are only on the surface. The front door broke immediately after moving in and took the maintenance a few months before they replaced it and the new one did not even work well. Though the building just finished last year(2012), the paint are peeling off in many area and the floor is fading in addition to the window was installed wrong and it could never be shut. The worst of of all, the management is mean and deceptive. They try to squeeze extra money out of you in any way possible even if it is illegal. They advertised and assured us that the one bedroom of the 2 bedroom unit to be $776 per month including the utility and collected the deposit in June, but they waited till close to the move in time before they actually showed the rental agreement with the rent amount of $ 963. When I questioned about it, they explained that they will give 1 month free rent and $550 concession. I pointed out that it is still way more than they said it will be per month. Then they changed their story saying that there will be one and half month rent credit and $ 800 concession, but there will be fee for amortize these specials. I told them it does not need to be amortized. Then they tried to charge extra for getting 3rd floor unit when we did not ask for it. They assigned us the unit without asking our preference.( They say they cannot honor any preference.)  I pointed out that being on the 3rd floor is more troublesome for moving as we have to carry furniture up and down the stairs as they dont have elevators.  They insisted it was better because of the privacy and insisted on charging extra for it. I never heard of 3rd floor extra charge. How ridiculous can they get? Of course we decided not to renew the lease and deducted the holding deposit from the last month rent. They charged us $ 75 as late fee for not paying the full rent amount threatening legal action, though the rental agreement does not state the holding deposit becomes security deposit. When we asked to have an extra day as a new apartment is not available till September 1st, they utterly refused saying the inspection is to be done at 7 am on that day and they had to do the work before new tenants moved in. ( They did not let us move in till September 12th though they counted the full 30 days of September as rental days.)   As we had no other choice, we moved out in the morning of September 1st.  Nobody came till 10 am and it was no problem as there were a lot of other apartments to inspect. Now they are charging us $96( 3 X daily rental amount) for being half a day late moving out though the rental agreement does not state the penalty. I know it is illegal to charge rent from two different people for the same place during the same time period. They also charge $ 265 per year to park your car there and they only have very limited 2 hour parking spaces for guests. There are no street parking space available nearby, either. The apartment buildings are designed poorly and it is long walk from any parking space to apartment units and it is real pain to move in and out, especially on the 3rd floor. Buses to UC come only every half hour during weekdays and every hour on weekend and during Summer, tough they told us it comes every 15 minutes.
