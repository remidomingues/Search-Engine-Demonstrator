Thehttp://agcenter.ucdavis.edu Ag Center is a multidisciplinary research program at UC Davis that studies and promotes the health and safety of farm workers. Its administrative offices are located one mile south of campus on Old Davis Road, at the address(Center for Health and Environment, 38.519706 ,121.756443).

The center was established in 1990 by the Centers for Disease Control through cooperative agreement with the National Institute for Occupational Health and Safetyfootnote(http://agcenter.ucdavis.edu/AgDoc/NIOSHAgCenters012209.pdf) to protect and improve the health and safety of farmers, farmworkers, and consumers in California.


Projects
National Tractor Safety Project
The Ag Center conducted a social study into public perceptions of tractor safety in three California counties. Based on findings they developed recommendation for future research for the national project.
Tractor accidents are a major cause of injury in agriculture, inquiries into the public opinion led to a key understanding to educating the public in regards to tractor safety.

WOSHTEP
The Ag Center in cooperation with centers at UCLA and UC Berkeley developed the Worker Occupational Safety and Health, Training and Education Program (WOSHTEP) aimed to reduce injury and illness from occupational hazards in agriculture. This program was created in 2002 as a result of a change in workers compensation policy and is administrated by the http://www.dir.ca.gov/CHSWC/ Commission on Health, Safety and Workers Compensation Program.
