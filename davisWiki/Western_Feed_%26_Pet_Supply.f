20130418 08:52:41 nbsp This store is fantastic. The staff is exceptionally helpful and friendly, and the prices are quite good. Much better experience than PetCo. They have dog, cat and some small animal stuff. The variety of food options they have is not as great as a bigbox store because the stuff they carry is generally high quality. Users/MichaelPlotkin

20131130 11:18:22 nbsp This is a great place for pet supplies, pet food, some things like chicken feed, some horse feed, and they have some horse/livestock supplies. The staff is very helpful and is always offering to price match or order products they dont have. Ive never left here without being helped by two to three different employees. They are fantastic and their prices are fairly average. Although not necessarily cheaper than Petco, its worth a few extra bucks to help a local business where the staff actually cares about your animal and can answer questions. Also, they have the VIP clinics which are great. The vets and vet techs who come in are so nice and friendly. Users/ChardaeJones

20140319 11:08:02 nbsp They carry a pretty good selection of things that are harder to find at other pet stores (chicken supplies, etc.) and their staff is very knowledgeable and helpful (sometimes almost too helpful). The folks who work there are more than willing to answer questions about the products, and remember you when you come in. I enjoy going back there! Users/karinp

20140506 20:39:08 nbsp Have been shopping here since they came to town and I couldnt be happier.  Same price for chicken and rabbit food as I was paying in Dixon but with a super helpful staff who know their stuff and always carry bags out to my car.   Great store! Users/Arturgreensward
