Western Redbud (Cercis occidentalis) grows as a large deciduous shrub or small multitrunked tree. It blooms early in the spring, typically before the copper, heartshaped leaves appear. The beautiful magenta pealike flowers are prominent in March. In fact, Cercis occidentalis is a member of the pea family, and the flowers are edible! These native California plants can reach a mature size of 20 feet tall and 15 feet wide. They grow in the dry California foothills and valley floors. The western redbud is very droughttolerant and prefers limited summer irrigation. The bright coppery spring foliage changes by weather summer to bluegreen and clusters of flat red or brown seed pods appear amongst the leaves. Toward late fall the leaves gradually drop, exposing the remaining pods which often hang on until spring. Different parts of the tree were used by Native Americans Â— stems for baskets, leaves for incense, and roasted seed pods for food. Both the flowers and young pods were eaten. Young fall redbud branches are highly valued by Native American basket weavers for their winered coloring, while the white inner sapwood of young spring branches is equally prized as weft wood. The UC Davis Arboretum features some particularly nice plantings.
