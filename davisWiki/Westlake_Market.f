Westlake Market (formerly known as Westlake IGA) is owned and operated by the DeLano family.

The store boasts a bakery (featuring baked inhouse bread and bagels and Fluffy Donuts), deli, service deli, fresh sushi, gourmet cheeses, and extensive produce section with local growers and a high organic component.  (Is there any conventional produce available here? Answer: Yes. Westlake tries to carry both conventional and organic for each type of produce.) Now that the liquor license http://www.davisvanguard.org/index.php?optioncom_content&viewarticle&id3170:planningcommissionvotestorecommendfullalcohollicenceforwestlakeigamarket&catid53:landuseopenspace&Itemid86 has cleared, they also carry a selection of beer, wine, and liquor. If you cant find something you want, let the management know and they will make efforts to stock that product (see this http://groups.dcn.org/dang/2010gettingreadyforthegrandopening DANG interview with Denice Harrington).  The Market has a website http://www.westlakemarket.net where you can find the weekly sale ad, ask Mr. D questions, and submit requests or suggestions. You can become a fan of their http://www.facebook.com/pages/WestlakeMarket/266852036706062 Facebook page to hear about special deals, participate in contests (such as the Why I love Westlake IGA video contest they had in November to give away a $200 gift certificate), hear about fundraisers they are holding for the community, and be among the first to know about their new products.

The service deli offers a seasonal soup bar, rotating several different varieties of soups and chowders, three of which are offered each day. The price is $4.49 for 16 oz and $7.49 for 32 oz. The deli also offers a variety of sandwich options, all of which are $4.99 for medium to large sized sandwiches (some of the bread options are larger, resulting in a larger sandwich).


There is a Coinstar machine located in the store (No gift cards but it has ecertificates to places such as Amazon and iTunes). A water vending machine was added outside the store in March 2010 (35 cents per gallon).  There is a propane tank exchange service out front as well.

They bake their own french rolls ($.99) which are usually available hot in the evening or you can get a halfbaked one  anytime and cook it at home.

Westlake Market hosts a BBQ every weekend (Saturdays and Sundays). Tritip $13.99 each, 1/2 chickens $2.99 each(I bought a tritip for Easter and it was amazing. Just... amazing.  Stephanie Studebaker)

The weekly ad does not currently go out in the mail, however you can join the mailing list to receive it via email. Ask a checker instore or click Email Coupons and Updates on their website to subscribe. You can also find the ad http://www.westlakemarket.net/ad.pdf here.

The store used to double manufacturers coupons up to $1 (e.g. if you have a $1 coupon, theyll double it to $2; over $1 will be good for an additional dollar, ie: $1.50 > $2.50), up to three of the same items/coupons. However this was discontinued on February 1, 2012.

In June, the store started carrying a selection of giftcards for popular retail locations such as Home Depot, Barnes and Noble, GAP, iTunes, and others. If youre looking for a particular gift card, ask a manager about it. They have many more gift cards in back, but just didnt have space to put out everything, so they still may have just what you need.

As of mid April (2011) they have started to sell http://www.calottery.com/default.htm California Lotto goodies such as scratchers (in a dispenser) as well as the typical myriad of number picking games. You can use a winning scratcher to pay for all or a portion of your groceries (depending on how much you won of course).  California Lotto and Scratchers are no longer sold here as of December, 2013.

For Summer 2012, Westlake Market has added an Ice Cream stand, featuring Dryers Ice Cream by the scoop.  The pricing is as follows: Childs scoop, $1.00.  One (adult) scoop, $1.50.  Two scoops, $2.25.  Three scoops, $3.00.  The serving (scoop) sizes are very generous.  The stand is usually located outside the store during weekends, and moved inside by the deli during the week.


History

Westlake Market opened (as Westlake IGA) at 9am on Friday January 15, 2010.

In December 2010, the DeLano family http://www.sfgate.com/cgibin/article.cgi?f/c/a/2010/11/29/BUO61GJ0SP.DTL announced the closure of all of their DeLanos IGA stores (Castro, Geary, South VanNess, Mill Valley, San Rafael), which prompted concern from some West Davis residents (see Letter to the Editor: http://www.davisenterprise.com/story.php?id611.0 Dont Let This Great Market Die Davis Enterprise Dec 5, 2010).

West Davis is at risk of losing IGA! There will be a community meeting on Wednesday, June 1, 2011 at 7pm at Stonegate Country Club in hopes of drumming up support for the store. If the store does not get enough support it will probably, unfortunately, become another West Davis entry on the Departed Businesses list.

On September 1, 2011, Westlake IGA became Westlake Market. Please note that someone unaffiliated with the market has set up a web site using a http://westlakeiga.com/ domain name that sounds like it belongs to this market, while sneaking in some Christian proselytizing.


20100116 00:17:21 nbsp I went today! A small store, but theyve got a little of everything. Im really excited to have a store thats around the corner from my house. Plus, they give a 5% discount to students (and various public service officials of the City of Davis like firemen and police peeps) WHOO. Users/ChristyMarsden

20100116 10:06:54 nbsp Im thrilled to have a grocery store within walking distance of my home, and I was delighted to see the store packed with employees this morning, all of whom were friendly and eager to help.  I went into the store with moderate expectations, knowing that it was a small store and that selection wouldnt be as wide as at standard supermarkets, but buoyed with hope by early reviews.

That said, I have to admit I was disappointed for three reasons: price, quality of fruit, and ergonomics.  Prices were considerably higher than Nugget, especially for beverages (soy milk, orange juice, lemonade) and produce (plus, some fruit on display was actually pulpy).  Finally, Im puzzled by the teeny tiny carts; they were the right size for my fouryearold to push, not adults, and especially not tall adults.

I think this is going to be a great store if Im cooking something and need one or two ingredients, and I appreciate that the store may draw other businesses to Westlake Plaza.  I had hoped Westlake IGA would be the kind of place where I could run to stock up on basics while going to grocery stores with larger selections more infrequently.  Unfortunately, thats not going to work out for my family if this store remains priced and stocked as it does now.  Ill definitely visit again in a few weeks to see if prices have dropped, and in the spring when produce may be fresher, but its not looking like a place Ill shop regularly. Users/LeslieMadsenBrooks

20100117 14:26:55 nbsp I just shopped there today. I was impressed! The size is not an issue; if anything, a smaller sized store will force them to be very smart about what to stock. If the owners are wise, this will evolve quickly to peoples tastes. Where Im from (SF), a small grocery store is smaller than Newsbeat downtown, and yet they are a staple.

I was impressed by the meat and fish  everything looked really fresh. I havent purchased veggies from them, so I have yet to see how they compare to the Nugget or Coop. They carry LU cookies, Honest Tea (the flavors in glass containers), and good brands of milk, so they are clearly on the right track.

I cant wait to see how this great new grocery store evolves. Users/VinceBuffalo

20100201 10:43:26 nbsp I was incredibly happy to see a grocery store open here again. It has been such a pain to go up to safeway to get an onion (sometimes they would even be out). I have done the bulk of my grocery shopping here since they have opened and I enjoy it, especially since it is a short walk from my apartment. It is more expensive than most grocery stores, but the fact that it is a 2 minute walk as opposed to a 510 minute drive makes it worth it.

The shopping carts are smaller to accommodate the narrower aisles, if they were the larger carts you could not fit two to an aisle. I am about 6 ft tall and I have not had a problem. I guess they could be a hassle if you are well over 6 feet.  Users/JamesKrause

20100201 12:08:23 nbsp great, great store. very happy to finally have a local place to do my shopping. all products are fresh and of top quality. prices are indeed noticeably higher for staple items ($0.50$1), but not exorbitantly so. an independent family store doesnt have the purchasing power that a megastore like Safeway has so i dont expect rock bottom prices. plus i dont mind paying a tad more to not deal with that awful marketplace parking lot and the always woefully understaffed North Davis Safeway (3 checkers on a Sunday night! lines streaming into the aisles! 2030 min check times!) despite the small size, Westlake has everything you need, a great deli, decent beer selection, and is always well staffed (so far). i guess my only complaint is that during peak times, its a little hard to move around as the aisles are small. but i guess thats the problem you have with any busy grocery store. good for them (and for us) for being busy. i love being able to walk to the store, and the pet friendly area is also a plus as i can walk my dog there as well. (more leash hooks would be nice, though.) a welcome addition to the neighborhood. Users/KevinWan

20100201 15:55:32 nbsp Ive been many times to this new store: shopping for a weeks worth of groceries, and just picking up a few items at a time.  I have been very pleased with their variety.  The deli meat and cheese is reasonably priced and tastes great; the rotisserie chicken is a bargain and usually can feed our family of 4 twice; the sushi (crab roll) is delicious; good tasting organic apples; delicious fresh salsa (Casa Sanchez).  Thanks for carrying pies, cookies, and cream cheese that are nondairy.  I noticed some of the prices went up after opening day, but overall, the prices are similar to other grocery stores that I shop at.  I love being able to bike or walk to the grocery store!  Now if we could get items from Sugar Plum Bakery in Sacramento stocked, itd be perfect. Users/BeckyLinvill

20100206 11:01:40 nbsp Had a wonderful 15min walk to IGA the other day with our baby boy in his stroller  emphasis on the fact that we walked there (the W. Davis Pond being full of water from all the 2010 winter rains was a bonus)!  HOORAY FOR IGA!!!  I agree with other peoples rave reviews, especially with two main positives I really like: 1) Location serving 1000s of people & 2) Choice to sell lots of quality, organic products . . . Favorites so far: Environmentallyconscious (free) bags!  Sushi!  Il Fornaio bread loaves!  Nice design!  Also, it was impressive that the store sponsored the $1 hot dog fundraiser for the Davis Schools Foundation last week, too  KUDOS all around! Users/JasonBundy

20100302 14:51:59 nbsp Im very pleased after FINALLY having a market. They are a wonderfully serviced and stocked. My only complaints as a regular and loyal customer is that the majority of the hot deli food is packaged while too piping hot and is sold very soggy in warm plastic. Safeway has those square metal trays in the deli case were the food stays heated and I wish IGA had something like that. I hope that they start to carry organic ice cream, frozen Acai, a larger selection of organic and Greek Yoghurts. Other than that, a PERFECT STORE! Users/MaryCarroll

20100408 01:10:19 nbsp Kind of bummed they dont have hotter girls here. Only 2 girls are hot, a blonde and a brunette. I pretty much only go in and shop because of them, as shallow as that sounds. I like their products in the store and the 5% discount for students, but the 2 girls arent bad to look at either. Seems like a fun place to work, staff is friendly too. Havent had their BBQ but I have heard great things.  Users/tylergrant
  College towns, drawing creepy shoppers since 1802... Users/TomGarberson P.S. was this meant to be tongue in cheek?  I hope so.

20100625 12:43:37 nbsp I went here for the first time today for my lunch break.  I got a grilled panini style BBQ tritip sandwich.  It was delicious!!  And very reasonably priced for $5.99.  I think it might even be a $1 or more cheaper than a nugget sandwich.  Also it was nice that I could check out at the deli section.  If you were on a short lunch break this would be great and make it easy to get in and out.  I also noticed just from walking around that the prices seem really reasonable and cheaper than a lot of other stores.  The organic peaches were cheaper than savemart.

Great store and friendly helpful staff!!  Users/JessicaAdams

20100907 10:08:23 nbsp Im 100% retracting the comment I made after they first opened. This store is ridiculously over priced (the Tri Tip went from 10.99 to about 13.99 in matter of two weeks without changing weight) and with the exception of Jeanette, the majority of the checkers are catty snide, sullen and annoyingly poor at customer service. The front end staff is too young. The produce, deli and sushi people are always polite but why they have these dour and sullen people checking is beyond me. Im going back to COOP and eventually TJs. later days, Westlake. Users/MaryCarroll

20100910 22:05:58 nbsp IGA is a few cents and sometimes a dollar more than chain stores, I dont mind because I like supporting small businesses/family owned. IGA carries about everything that you need to fill up your fridge. The service is very friendly! and I love how they give out reusable bags that look super kool! Users/RyanaLove

20100921 13:32:06 nbsp My comment is about the deli. I go to the deli to get sandwiches about once a week. The blonde lady always does a really good job. I went today and the dark haired, young guy completely messed up my order (I was the only customer at the deli). I took the sandwich back to get it remade and he asked if he could just scrape off the part that was wrong!? When I said no, he acted like I was being a jerk. There was no apology and the remade sandwich wasnt even that good compared to the ones the other lady usually makes. If I even go back, I wont get a sandwich from him again. Users/AmandaCarpenter

20101010 11:06:35 nbsp am very impressed how this store is.... omg.... this store is so nice specially that people that work there, meat department is always nice and clean, cashiers are so friendly, deli makes some tri tip sandwiches that are bomb!! I like everyone in deli specially mark anthony when her make my sandwiches.... overall excellent store, great service and very clean and nice to it size.... going back for sure everyday Users/emilyjackson

20101130 00:25:25 nbsp According to this SF Gate article http://www.sfgate.com/cgibin/article.cgi?f/c/a/2010/11/29/BUO61GJ0SP.DTL, Delano may close some of their stores due to low customer turnout and struggling economy. Economy did not say which stores will close but stay tune. Users/SimonFung

20101201 11:31:37 nbsp Westlake IGA and Fairfax IGA are separate business/legal entities from Delanos IGA. There are no plans to close Westlake or Fairfax, currently. Users/StephanieStudebaker

20110201 22:22:40 nbsp Its pretty awesome that a store of this size is able to stay open til midnight. Very convenient. Ive also gotten some really good deals on chicken here. Milk is way overpriced, as is a lot of what they carry. However, their generic brand items are significantly cheaper than the generic brand at other Davis grocery stores. For example, I paid $0.88 for a can of peas. That would be like $1.65 at Safeway. All in all, Im happy to have Westlake IGA up the street, but I can only afford to do some of my shopping there. Users/jsogul

20110328 14:36:59 nbsp By far the best thing about Westlake is its location. Having an easily accessible market in West Davis is super convenient, and the fact that they offer a student discount makes them even better! I also love that they are open late (11pm now?), because as a student, Im doing a lot of my cooking later at night, and I often find myself running to the store right before they close.
My only problem with this market is the extrahigh prices you pay for the same stuff you could buy much cheaper at Safeway. Basically, youre paying for the convenience of a closetohome shop, but clearly I dont mind paying it, haha.
Id say if you need to stock up, take the extra time and go to Safeway, if you need a few items, hop on over to Westlake. Users/Morganna

20110502 21:21:46 nbsp I love this store! The prices may be high but it is convenient for residents in West Davis. Nice management, nice workers, etc.!  Users/michellemt

20110603 22:06:15 nbsp West Davis is at risk of losing the IGA market.  If we lose this treasure of a grocery store, West Davis residents will no longer be able to go grab a quick and healthy bite (on the cheap) or that missing ingredient.  Part of the problem is that it seems like many people just buy a few items here and do most shopping elsewhere.  Although I am on a tight budget, I for one am going to start dedicating most of my shopping to Westlake IGA marketthey are a family run business supporting local farmers and keeping our dollars local. I hope other residents of the area will start shopping by the cartload instead of the basketload here and keep this wonderful market in our area. Lets rejuvenate this shopping center and think of other ways to keep the quality of life we are enjoying now that the market is here.  The staff are amazing and friendly!  Great selection, great produce! THANKS so much!!! I heart IGA! Users/TivaLasiter

20110624 21:04:48 nbsp I would be so sad to see the IGA go; it was the reason we chose to live the apartment complex we did. Their sale prices are excellent, and they have everything we need. And there isnt a more friendly or helpful grocer in Davis. I certainly hope people are not discouraged from shopping there because some items are a few cents more expensive After all, People dont shop at the Food Coop for their rock bottom prices. The IGA has quality food, lots of vegan and vegetarian options, its ridiculous convenient, and the staff is amazing. Weve made the decision to do all our grocery shopping at the IGA. Users/KimberlyWarren

20110627 21:04:48 nbsp I too hope they stay but prices are getting out of control. The Orgain organic meal replacement shake went from 2.79 to 3.59!! The steak on weekends that they BBQ is still 13.99 but is literally 2/3s smaller than it was a few months agoyes 2/3s! I shop there almost exclusively and they have the best staff but now no more sushi, sour dough bread, acai etc and Id getting concerned. I WILL KEEP SHOPPING THERE THOUGH!!Users/MaryCarroll



20110808 11:38:52 nbsp Love this store.  I remember when the original Farmtown Market opened back in the late 80s, with the owners pouring champagne and locals packing the store.  Of course, back then it was a full sized store... it occupied all the (likefacing) adjacent areas to the existing store, and was a full size grocery store.  As is well documented on this site, the fanfare didnt last... poor design, local competition (Safeway at Marketplace) and questionable location led to several successive failures at this site.  Also, since the old store hired nonunion staff, it was picketed constantly.  History being what it was, the existing store is great.  Never too crowded of course, very quiet neighborhood  atmosphere, and a pretty decent selection of merchandise.  Great, friendly, helpful staff as well.  I sure hope they stick around. Users/OldDavis73

20110910 21:46:48 nbsp My family and I love Westlake IGA.  We go almost every day.  I dont know what someone was talking about when they said the checkers were catty and snide.  I have never had a bad experience with any Westlake IGA employee.  On the contrary, most employees know me and my daughter by name, and always go out of their way to be helpful and friendly.  We feel like the store is a big family, and were a part of it.  Its worth slightly higher prices to not have to drive across town, to invest in our local economy (and they make an effort to sell local organic produce.  I havent found better produce anywhere in Davis, including the farmers market), and to have a friendly, old fashioned store where they know my name and what kind of apples my daughter prefers! Users/SarahHughes

20111124 01:45:58 nbsp Westlake Market is a fun place to shope. Friendly checkers and a very clean store. The prices are high there is no doubt, but its great for west davis convenience.  Users/JakeJames
  I like to shope there too :) Users/jsbmeb

20120104 11:39:40 nbsp The TriTip here is really great. Staff is also really friendly and go out of the way to make sure youre taken care of.  Users/sba

20120110 21:49:53 nbsp Im hooked on Westlake Markets freshly baked French bread. It has a thin crispy crust, is shaped like a baguette and is usually still warm from the oven...99cents!  It makes great sandwiches, good with soup/coffee/breakfast, but I usually cant wait and start eating it on my way home from the market.  Very friendly crew, nice selection of groceries, warm and inviting atmosphere (and only a 5min walk from my apartment).  Campus Staff UC Davis staff also get the 5% discount, by the way! Users/DukeMcAdow

20120117 17:21:56 nbsp This place is great. Folks always are willing to help you and at the bare minimum will give you a smile and ask how your day is. 5% discount is great; and they have a lot for their location, even if they might be lacking that one ingredient. All the same, shopping here is always a pleasure and Im going to continue to shop here. Users/DanTee

20120119 16:43:16 nbsp I have lived in this neighborhood for years. I love this market! Mary Carrol I am shocked that you had a bad experience with store employees! They bend over backwards to please their customers. Maybe you could try again? Users/ashleyinthemist
  I think you misread her comment.  She complained about the prices, not the employees.  She said, they have the best staff.  Wait  I take that back.  She has three comments on this page.  In one of them, she criticizes the staff, but in a later one (the one I quoted) she praises them. Users/CovertProfessor

20120119 22:06:42 nbsp I like Westlake, but I rarely shop there.  Its about the same distance from my place as Safeway, but its a LOT more expensive.  I havent done any thorough comparisons, but my impression is that a typical shopping list is around 2025% pricier at Westlake.  If Ive got the time, Id much rather go to Nugget.  Its got the great service of Westlake without the hugely elevated prices. Users/TomGarberson

20120301 19:12:02 nbsp The hot french bread they make  is great and its only 99 cents. They make em 6 at a time throughout the day so theyre never sitting around for very long. If you dont see any, ask them and theyll either put it in or take it out of the oven for you. Users/MikeyCrews


20120715 14:47:15 nbsp Great place. I dont shop here regularly but I come here for the ACME bread. BEST BREAD EVER! My boyfriend is a bit snobby about the quality of his bread for things like homemade garlic bread, cheese fondue, cheese & bread for lunch, etc. and when we eat together, he will request or get the ACME bread. They also have a pretty good selection of craft beers for a small store (and I like the selection here a lot better than Safeways). The prices arent too much more than Safeway, and the selection is pretty good for a small store. I LOVE LOVE LOVE that they are open from 7 am  11PM EVERY day! Overall, not my pick for an every day, buyinggroceriesfortheweek store, but I do love it for shopping occasionally. And its not far at all from my apartment, so its extremely convenient. :) Users/kimmisan

20120808 14:48:58 nbsp I recently moved quite a bit closer to Westlake Market, and Ive got to say its nice having it around.  I was disappointed the other day, though, to realize just how poor their seafood department is.  From memory, there were a few packages each of red snapper, tuna, two varieties of shrimp, oysters, and fake crab.  There mightve been one or two others that Ive forgotten, but it was extremely sparse.  It doesnt help that the fish looked pretty old.

Anyway, that said, Ill be going here a lotjust not for seafood.  Theyve got nice produce and the dollar loaves of french bread are handy!  The meat department looked decent, although I didnt peruse it closely. Users/TomGarberson

20121120 22:44:03 nbsp The prices tend to be a bit higher than other places around Davis, but the staff is generally very nice and I enjoy being able to casually walk to the market from my residence. The best part of it is without a doubt the dollar loaves of bread I frequently go to the market with the primary intention of purchasing the bread. The bread is so good. Users/ThomasReeder

20130331 21:37:18 nbsp The roast halfchicken (Rockys) tastes great and is real bargain. That, with a salad and some of their freshbaked bread makes a really nice dinner. Users/DukeMcAdow

20130905 nbsp I think Im going to need to wear a jacket every time I want to go shopping in here, because the moment I walked in through the doors, I felt like I just stepped into a freezer. I could barely go through the aisles without shivering.

I wish their Asian food selection was bigger, though. I see more Asian food selection over at Savemart than here.

20140313 14:16:17 nbsp They make some pretty cool sandwiches, too bad they forget the meat or some other ingredient half the time and then treat you like a child when you bring it up. Users/MaxwellKappes

20140406 14:52:32 nbsp Ughhh to anyone who reads this, your better off getting grocery produce from safeway or costco. This place is RIDICULOUSLY expensive and the quality is HORRIBLE. They SKIMP OUT on your meat when you order sandwiches, which are below average at best (GO TO SUBWAY). Not to mention the workers are very slow and roll your eyes whenever your ask for one If you feel like chips, crackers, or soda, your better of going to the store next door (Family Dollar). Chances are if you can find it at this supermarket, itll be at Family Dollar for $1. Would NOT recommend.  Users/Andyy
