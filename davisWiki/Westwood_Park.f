I delivered papers in this neighborhood for 3 years, and my favorite times were Sunday mornings. It was really neat to ride my bike across the park and leave a track in the frost, and it was really beautiful in the pouring rain also. Users/NickSchmalenberger

This park was around before most every house in the area (North  of the park) was built, even before Emerson Junior High School was built in 1980. Users/OldDavis73
