The climbing/sliding apparatus certainly appropriate for ages 5 & up with handsoff supervision; also fine for younger children with handson supervision. Two tot swings and two standard swings. Small sand pit. Equipment is in excellent condition and park is wellmaintained. It appears that the citys open container ordinance does not apply to this park.
