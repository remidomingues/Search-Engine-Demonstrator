SOPA and PROTECTIP are Congressional bills supported by large media companies that threaten to make sites with user contributed content (like the Davis Wiki) impossible.



Please take a moment to http://boingboing.net/2011/11/11/stopsopasavetheinternet.html watch this video on the horrible PROTECTIP act.  If it passes  and it looks like it has a very good chance of passing  sites like DavisWiki may have to be shut down due to extraordinary legal costs.

Please https://wfc2.wiredforchange.com/o/9042/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY8173 sign this petition to help stop the bill.

These bills, it can be said without cynicism, were drafted by noninternet experts who were only concerned with clamping down on piracy of intellectual property like music, movies and other copyrighted material. The bills are dangerous because they werent vetted so that they wouldnt tamper with the infrastructure of the world wide web, like the DNSDomain Name System. Also very serious consequences could result from linking to copyrighted websites, which is an established norm for collaborative efforts such as the Davis Wiki.

The Davis Wiki joined online protests November 16, 2011 (American Censorship Day) and on January 18, 2012.

  Heh.  I wish it were, alas, this is the real world, so we wont be able to discover that the entire season was a dream. jw

20120117 11:21:20 nbsp Has Davis Wiki discussed blacking out tomorrow in protest of SOPA? Users/justincox22

20120117 15:38:08 nbsp Yes.  The conversation to establish support is on Wiki Community/SOPA PIPA blackout proposal, and a couple proposed text are at Wiki Community/SOPA PIPA blackout text. Users/JabberWokky

20120119 13:04:18 nbsp I participated in the blackout on the 18th.  By reading http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CongressLookup?newyes Wikipedias followup it can be seen that the protest had a big impact.  But the battle isnt over yet.  The sponsors of the legislation will probably modify it to make it palatable enough to pass a vote.  Its fundamental flaws arent being recognized or understood.  After reading up on it some more, I would like to telephone my representatives and maybe others.  I understand that talking to people is the most effective action.
 Now that Ive read some more about it, Im greatly relieved that theres been quite a pushback for these bills, including the timeline toward adopting them.  Users/BruceHansen
