Whimsy Cupcakes was a madetoorder cupcake catering service based in Davis. All cupcakes were made by owner/cupcake designer Emily Ringelman.

The final website menu had 14 flavors (one vegan) and seasonal offerings. Custom/vegan/gluten free requests were accepted. A notable facet of Whimsy Cupcakes was the beautiful decorations. Most cupcakes were decorated in a whimsical way with edible items, like the marshmallow shark fins on the Shark Attack! cupcakes, and the chocolate electric guitar on the Rockstar cupcakes. Other cupcakes were decorated in a more traditional fashion, using multiple frosting varieties, drizzled chocolate, nuts, and more. Whimsy Cupcakes had varieties suitable for children (like Birthday Wishes) and adults (Margaritaville) alike, including those adults that are children at heart (Root Beer Float).

The cupcakes were all handmade in small batches using the best ingredients. In an effort to be as environmentally responsible as possible, Whimsy Cupcakes used many local and organic ingredients. Cupcakes came packaged in recyclable brown kraft paper boxes.


20091019 11:18:57 nbsp Emilys cupcakes are amazing.  Ive been able to try many flavors in various stages of development and they are always delicious.  My favorite are the Root Beer Float cupcakes, with a close second being the Rockstar cupcakes.  The seasonal pumpkin cupcakes are also great.  You should pretty much order some right now, what are you waiting for?!? Users/elsie22

20091019 14:01:39 nbsp Whimsy Cupcakes are so delicious and fun!  The caramelized mango buttercream on The Escape is to die for.  The Sunflower Fields is a Whimsy classic.  Do you deliver to San Diego?  :) Users/lkls

20091019 17:58:20 nbsp These cupcakes are almost too exquisite to eat. Owner Emily Ringelman is constantly experimenting and coming up with new flavors and decorations and is always open to suggestions and requests! Users/wilkml

20091022 12:03:35 nbsp I am not known for having a sweet tooth, and these cupcakes blow my mind! The cake part is so moist and the frostings so creamy, I cant resist. Ive even almost gotten into a fistfight with someone who tried to steal my margaritaville cupcake at a bbq (YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE!!). The shark attack is very cool and tasty but my favorite hands down is the margarita. Users/Buck

20091025 19:29:21 nbsp I was able to taste Emilys Malted cupcakes and they just melt in your mouth!  The cake is tasty, moist and doesnt crumble like some cakes do.  The frosting was unbelievable!  I highly recommend these cupcakes!  They are great as a treat but would be fun and gorgeous at a wedding, graduation, shower, etc.  Yummy!   Users/Sparrott

20091101 11:03:29 nbsp I even created a wiki profile just so that I could make this comment. I recently received a dozen Rockstar cupcakes from Whimsy Cupcakes for my birthday. I understand that the owner, Emily Ringelman, went the extra mile to help make the order happen. The cupcakes were tasty, lovely, and remained fresh several days after their delivery. And believe me, when you receive a dozen cupcakes, how long they can stay fresh is really important! Ive sampled the cupcake options available in Davis, and these might just be the best, considering tastiness, presentation, and freshness. :) Users/RMG
