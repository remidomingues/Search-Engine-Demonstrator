20090624 22:04:11 nbsp Very professional work done to get my macbook back up and running, not to mention in the span of about 2 days.  He points out any problems in your presence associated with the computer in question and gives you an idea of what he will do, then gets to work.  Upfront and honest, no bull, especially with logistics.  Pricing is very reasonable and he works efficiently.

I would easily recommend going to the Mac Paramedic over an Apple Store due to his availability and extremely flexible work hours.
In short, this IS the person to take your mac to when you have problems or perhaps questions.

Thanks Larry!! Users/ecj

20091008 11:06:23 nbsp Ive met Larry, and I think he is awesome. I would send any problem with an Apple I couldnt fix myself to him without hesitation. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20091011 19:49:10 nbsp Larry has been helping me setup, upgrade, troubleshoot, connect to DSL, fix my MacIntosh computers since 2001.  He promptly responds to emails/phone calls and is usually available within 2448 hours to work on the computer.  He is EXTREMELY competent and wellversed in his computer knowledge.  He is my one stop shop answer to all MacIntosh related matters!  Its great to have a good doctor . . . a good auto mechanic . . . and a good computer technician!   Users/cregross

20091023 20:40:02 nbsp Efficient, friendly, reasonably priced, and best of all, effective. It really was a pleasure to work with Larry, who returned my call right away, met me at home the next morning despite a busy schedule, and had my Macbook up and running within 24 hours. And the paramedic title is completely apt; he assessed my computers vitals with the mark of a pro. If I have any problems again with my Mac, my consolation will be working with Larry again!

20100903 01:08:15 nbsp Mac Paramedic, is the place to go for apple assistance in Davis.  Larry understands all the new stuff coming out, and can explain how they work, not just with apple also with PC as well.  As more and more of us pc users purchase ipods and ipads it is complex how they connect, and when problems happen it is wonderful to be able to get assistance from a respected business in Davis. I appreciate all your help with my ipod/ pc interactions, I would be lost without your assistance.  jamie    Users/Jamie523

20101117 10:48:32 nbsp Larry Dietrich has helped me several times with my Macbook and has been able to do this very soon after I called for help. He can fix anything! and he manages to do it without making you feel stupid. This is a big plus. Larry is extremely honest and helpful. I would never go anywhere else with my Mac problems. Thank you Larry for helping me enjoy and learn about my computer! Users/AnneSyer

20101217 13:33:31 nbsp I would highly recommend Larry for any of your Mac repair needs. Right from the getgo, when I spoke to him on the phone he was very accommodating, offering to either make a house call or for me to come to his workshop. He was able to calmly diagnose the problem with my laptop, and his pricing is very reasonable.

The nearest Mac store is in Arden Fair, Sacramento and its usually overrun with people. Larry was able to see me in Davis the same day I contacted him, and so I avoided the inconvenience of the commute to Sac and waiting in a crowded store. I will definitely be calling him the next time I have a problem with my Mac, and you should do the same! Users/SoniaFerrandiz

20110303 13:41:53 nbsp Larry came over to our house and then found and fixed our Mac problem in about 2 minutes.  I highly recommend him! Users/TeresaKing

20110405 14:17:09 nbsp Recently my Mac Workbook started clicking at start up and showing only a gray screen with a folder and question mark blinking in the middle.  Uh oh.  I consulted Davis Wiki and found the Mac Paramedic.  I called him late on a Saturday morning.  He made an appointment to come to my house and diagnose the problem for the middle of that afternoon.  The news was bad  new hard drive needed.  He took the computer, replaced the hard drive, and recovered my data, and had the computer back to me by that same evening.  Wow!  Great service, reasonable rates.  He has a lot of parts at his shop so in many cases you can get even complex jobs back very quickly.  Most highly recommended. Users/Dora5

20110504 09:20:13 nbsp I highly recommend The Mac Paramedic!
After accidentally downloading a fake antivirus software on my MacBook Pro I called Larry. He had heard of the virus, and was able to guide me through each step to get rid of it right over the phone. I expected to spend the day dealing with this problem but Larry was able to help me in just a few minutes without even leaving my home.
Thank you so much Larry!

20130109 13:32:14 nbsp I highly recommend Larry. He is active on the listserv for the Davis Mac Users Group. Last weekend he replied within two hours to my voicemail, and he solved the problem with my iMac over the phone in under 15 minutes. I would use his services again. Users/SylviaWright

20131101 12:10:44 nbsp I emailed the company and Andrew helped me out.  I was just asking for a consultation on an issue that I thought I had and they confirmed it in a very professional and courteous manner!
