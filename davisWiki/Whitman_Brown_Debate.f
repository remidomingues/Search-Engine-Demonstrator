UC Davis hosted the first of three debates in the race for governor on Sept. 28, 2010. Democratic Party Democratic candidate Jerry Brown and Republican Party Republican candidate Meg Whitman came together on stage at the Mondavi Center for an hourlong event that was broadcast live on TV, radio and internet feeds. Tickets were made available to local attendees via a lottery.

Due to the large number of press attendees, from 4pm to 12pm midnight, Mrak Hall Drive (between old Davis Road and Mrak Hall) and Alumni Lane (on the north and east sides of Vanderhoef Quad, in front of the Mondavi Center) were closed.

The afternoon before the debate, Jerry Brown took some time to run a few laps around the track at the ARC.

Both Brown and Whitman supporters were demonstrating outside the Mondavi before and during the event.

One of the questions was from an unidentified UC Davis student (posed by Capital Public Radioâ€™s Marianne Russ), asking whether the candidates would roll back UC Davis Budget Cuts funding cuts to the UC, CSU, and community colleges from recent years.

 Browns reply: Not in my first year, with a 19 billion dollar deficit.  We have to get real here.  I certainly dont want to see them go up...Ill hold down the fees the best I can, but were in a tough plight, and were all going to have to sacrifice. But Id say those at the top, those at the commanding heights of our economy, should tuck in their belts first...Look Id love to roll back the fees. Id love to have a freeze, but that would require either the university becoming a lot more efficient than it is or the state finding billions of dollars that it doesnt yet have. One way or the other, were going to protect UC.

 Whitmans reply: I want to reduce costs of this government and take a billion dollars and put it back in the UC system... Every day I talk to children who are at UC who have to take the semester off. I ran into a young man the other day who couldnt go back to UC Berkeley because fees had gone up by 32 percent and his father had lost his job... We have got to reform our pension program.  We have to reform our welfare program... Ive got some very specific plans to reform welfare; take some of that savings and put it back into higher education. She promised a billion dollars for higher education over the next two or three years, but would leave it to the Chancellors to determine how to best spend the money (on faculty, research, reducing fees, etc.).

  Evidently, Whitman thinks that the people attending college are children...
