Ought not there be a place for Davisites to ask questions? This is the place to ATTEMPT to find answers to those Davisrelated things you REALLY want to know.


  If you have other questions questions, ask the wiki!



(see also Where Can I ...)



  What is the deal with the birds around Anderson & LaRue ? Are these crows ? Why are they there ? You only need to drive a 100 yards in each direction and you dont see them anymore.
  What on earth is that very annoying buzzing sound that Ive been hearing around town lately? I only hear it in some places, and its never been present before. I hear it on Anderson Road and also behind Wright Hall as I cross the arboretum bridge to Wyatt. The noise sounds like an electrical charge, but I see no source, so I cant be sure that its not some kind of critter making  the sound. All I know is that it is infuriating and I want it to stop. Can anyone answer my question?

   You might be talking about wiki:WikiPedia:Cicadas, theyre bugs that make a pretty loud buzzing sound.. and they usually come out about this time of year.  I know Ive just noticed hearing them a lot around town recently. Users/JevanGray

   I thought of cicadas, but I have never heard any this loud before. I didnt know their buzzing was so sustained, either. Also, because Ive never heard them like this in Davis before, I cant say for certain if it is the cicadas or not. I appreciate your help in this investigation, though, so thanks! Youre probably right...I just cant imagine how they can be so loud! Users/EliseKane

  Does anyone know where the Butera House is? And what is its significance in Davis?

  Is there any kind of city ordinance that illegalizes or tries to prevent buskers (street musicians)?
   It is a stretch, but Davis Municipal Code/26.01.010 could be applied in some cases. Still looking for a stronger citation. You cant do it close to an ATM machine: http://www.city.davis.ca.us/cmo/citycode/detail.cfm?p26&q2488 26.01.140.  Users/JasonAller
    Ok then, assuming that Im not hassling people, so far Im ok?
    Loitering laws maybe?

  Who is that gentleman who is often at Campus Roma reading a book but always looking up from his reading from behind his glasses and staring at people? He has a white moustache and wears jeans and tshirts...I am just curious as to his identity.

  In the tall parking structure on fourth street downtown there is (were? its been a while since I was in there) a chainlink cage that houses two bicycles (quadcycles actually) built for four. Does anyone know who these belong to? Are they available for rent? Anyone? How about you?
   I think I once saw a picture of Ken Wagstaff riding one of these, so I assume they are part of the city motor pool, instead of limousines.  Users/NickSchmalenberger

  A front bicycle light is required by california law. Ive been told a rear light is required by the city of davis, but was unable to find anything in the muni code. is this bullshit?  Users/ArlenAbraham
      Only a rear reflector is required, not a light. Peter Anselmo

  What coffee shop in Davis has baristas who know and care about straight espresso? Do they use a Semiautomatic machine? (as opposed to a super automatic like Charbucks) Do they clean the group head frequently? Is anyone using a naked portafilter? If the answer is yes to two or more my questions Ill assume that the fresh bean is ground immediatly before dosing/tamping.


gotta know, are there bats under the bridge off covell by the high school?
  Bats Yes.


Does anyone know where I can buy a cheap, fulllength mirror?
   If you mean a back of the door style one, box stores and some pharmacies carry them during the fall for dorm rooms. jw
    Ikea and Target, of course. Probably Ace Hardware (or Housewares) store. :)


20090629 19:34:23 nbsp Where can I pick my own fruits? Not looking to pick wild fruits at the arboretum and such. Im looking towards farms and local places that allows customers to pick their own fruit and weigh them for a price. Any fruits, especially berries (cherries, strawberries, blueberries, etc) would be great. I have tried looking on yelp and daviswiki but only found one place thus far. Any locals know of a good place?

Please name address and/or directions. Note: I have a car so Im definitely willing to drive withing 30 mile radius of Davis (ie Dixon, Winters, Sac, etc) Users/KimN.
   There are several places like Impossible Acres, but I think theres no index or list of them.  If you browse through the farms farm pages and places on the outskirts, you can find some.  I know there are more than just Impossible Acres. jw
   Yes, Impossible Acres was the one that I found. But I keep hearing that there are more around this area but no straight answers yet. I was hoping the locals would know the good ones. What Im really looking for are blueberries. Man, if I found a farm that lets me pick these for a reasonable price... ). Strawberries and cherries make me happy too.

20090826 19:05:55 nbsp Question about a house that was demolished about three years ago.  I used to live in an old ranch style house on West Covell.  It was across Covell from what is now the Retirement Center.  And it was across from Sutter Davis Hospital as well, west of the hospital.  Ive been directed to ask the city for records and such, but this seems like an interesting shot in the meantime. Does anyone know anything about the history of this house?  It was 39664 West Covell, and its now just a field.  Some guy was growing sugar cane out there in the back forty a couple of years ago.  Any info would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks, AirporterDriverPete  Users/AirporterDriverPete

20090913 00:39:08 nbsp Can I dye fabric (100% cotton, or a polyester blend) from a dark color to a lighter one and viseversa? Also, could a dark color, such as black, be dyed into another dark color, such as dark green? Or a light color into an other color that is dark, like olive into dark green? Users/Rogue2

20090924 15:05:40 nbsp Since there appears to be no Bicycle Registration page...

Is it MANDATORY to register my bike (e.g. pay the $10? fee)? Thoughts/ideas? Thanks in advance! Users/H4rry

   Bicycle License.  I think the answer is yes on the UCD campus.
technically, it is not mandatory and TAPS is not really going to do anything unless you park it in a really bad place. however, if your bike is stolen, it could help

20100307 07:12:31 nbsp How do you deal with a user who keeps http://daviswiki.org/Users/vlam?actiondiff&version234&version133 making http://daviswiki.org/Davis_Wiki_Oracle?actiondiff&version257&version156 the http://daviswiki.org/Users/WoThere?actiondiff&version218&version117 same http://daviswiki.org/Yolo_County_Library__Mary_L._Stephens_Branch?actiondiff&version2158&version1157 alterations http://daviswiki.org/The_Peoples_Vanguard_of_Davis?actiondiff&version2168&version1166 and http://daviswiki.org/Users/JasonAller/Archive?actiondiff&version210&version19 deletions of others comments?  Users/TomGarberson
   20100307 10:38:24 nbsp I think at some point; let him.  Sometimes things are being kept for the sake of being stubborn.  Modify it to work as a compromise. If the information is important, it can often be integrated into the page.  If its something silly like being called a ferret in jest in another page, its not that important to keep.   On the guns on campus page, I was able to delete 5 or 6 of his comments that had no response or followup  theres no reason another editor couldnt have taken 10 seconds to check and do that.   A little bit of compromise is always the answer, imo .   Users/EdWins
      As a (lateadded) disclaimer, this comment isnt directed at Tom specifically but more as a general wikiphilosophy.  I wrote it thinking of multiple editors responses this last week or two, even a gnome. users/edwins ES
   (Assuming he ever finds this page via whats linked to him, watch as he goes editing TomGarbersons comment, too :P) At any rate, its best not to get too frustrated about it.  Hes trolling.  Your reaction is what he wants.   Users/AlexanderHo
   Letting it go works.  Bring up a ban is another option (I just got a message regarding that).  But Im guessing that theres opposition to that, given that hes not doing anything that actually damages the wiki, and incredibly annoying and perverse just to tick people off generally doesnt get community consensus, let alone strong consensus. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20100307 10:51:13 nbsp Its http://daviswiki.org/Users/AlexanderHo?actioninfo&links1 very easy to find the links.  Thats why I tried those test edits  I undid the wikilink but replaced it with an external link, and I also seem to have accidentally typod his name to prevent a search for it.   With only 7 or so links left to him, I didntt expect him to be fooled, but I thought it was worth a try.  Users/EdWins

20100707 14:40:39 nbsp Where did Shals Halal food go? I know they must have moved to another part of campus since I see holding brown bags with a water bottle, but the corner where Shals Halal use to be is isolated for construction thanks. Users/WengFF

20100720 00:28:43 nbsp Where can I do some welding in Davis? I have a car chassis that I want to seam weld. (I am a student so if I can pull any strings with the metal shop in Bainer or something like that let me know) Users/David.Tran

20100806 14:18:24 nbsp First,What are the small burrowing mammals that live in the research agricultural fields along Russell Blvd? They dont look like gophers but perhaps like a cross between a squirrel and a gopher. Are they chipmunks?
           Are they just Squirrels ground squirrels?  Spend a lot of time on their hindlegs, lack of bushy tails.


Second, I think your questions and answer page should be promoted! Make it a link on the DavisWiki front page. I think it should be like the Yahoo Answers page, but for Davis of course. Invite local experts to weigh in to answer questions, if necessary. Allow build in a tool to allow questions to be categorized.  Users/AnnieSirrah

20101216 10:06:16 nbsp Anyone know where I can learn how to DJ as a beginner to just try out and whatnot? Users/ClarenceL

 The Experimental College on campus offers a course, and you can also contact KDVS for tons of opportunities (both live DJing and radio DJing). Users/EliseKane

20101227 18:19:14 nbsp Can I get my macbook fixed at the tech hub or do I have to go to arden to get it fixed. Its still under apple warranty. Users/David.Tran
  Yes, Tech Hub can do Apple Inc. Mac repairs, including repairs under warranty.  See http://ucdavisbookstore.com/SiteText.aspx?id7031 this page for information.   Users/CovertProfessor

20110214 13:38:06 nbsp Where is an appropriate place to post a message in hopes that the asshole who committed a hitandrun around 10:55 a.m. today outside the ARC will see it? Im so angry I would love to post something nasty in huge letters at the top of the front page, but I dont want to wear out my welcome here... Users/MeggoWaffle
  Im not sure the wiki is the appropriate forum for that...I dont know how likely it is that the person would see it, even if they used the wiki. Maybe try going back at that same time next week, or the week after? at that time of day, you can probably assume they are a student or someone who doesnt have a regular work schedule, so they probably go at a specific time every week. I assume you talked to the police? Users/JoePomidor
      It was my friend, he was only banged up a bit, and didnt catch the license plate or even make/model so he figured it wasnt worth it to call the police since he didnt have any useful info. Im not expecting to catch them, but I would at least like them to feel bad about what they did speeding off like that. For all they knew he could have been seriously injured. I thought almost everybody in town uses the wiki at least once a week, but I was kidding about posting it on the front page. Maybe Ill just go edit the cars page to make it clear that its a crime to leave the scene of an accident. Users/MeggoWaffle

20110215 11:12:21 nbsp Graduated from UCD years ago; is there a way to look up my old student ID card #? Users/EdWins

20140215 16:40:16 nbsp Users/Katelynn113, Ive moved your question about your toddlers teeth over to Dental Questions so it can be seen by people with actual dental experience.  I think its going to be lost over here.  Did this happen at a dentist in Davis? Users/JudithTruman

20140511 20:15:16 nbsp About 3 years ago, I had intermittent pain & sensitivity to hot/cold on #30 tooth.  Xrays showed nothing, but dentist determined it could be a cracked tooth, even though a crack could not be seen, and suggested a crown.  The crown was placed, and I have still always had had the intermittent pain, more like an ache since then.  The only thing it alleviated was the hot/cold sensitivity. So I have just lived with the occasional ache/pain which would happen when chewing on that side, and taking ibuprofen when needed. About six weeks ago, during a routine cleaning, I happened to mention it since it had just been acting up, (this is not the same dentist who did the original crown) and an xray was taken of the gum area, and there was an abscess. The dentist suggested I see an endodontist who would determine whether a root canal could be done or, if the crack was too deep, if extraction was necessary.  One week later, the endodontist did a root canal, so I assumed he had determined the tooth was savable.  About 7 to 10 days after that, the tooth was achy and I had the funny taste in my mouth and my jaw was still a bit swollen.  Just to be safe, he prescribed 500mg of Amoxcil for 9 days.  Its been 10 days since I finished.  Three days ago, the tooth again became sensitive when I brush my teeth.  I shouldnt be feeling anything on that tooth, right?  Also, these last couple days, I have that funny taste in my mouth, and Im quite sure the infection is still there and getting worse.  Im scheduled to go back to my dentist on Thursday to have the permanent crown/filling done, but I am going to see if I can get in tomorrow due to the suspected infection. Im afraid hes going to suggest a redo on the root canal, or an apecitomy (sp?).  Would another round of antibiotics fix the problem?  If not, Id rather have the tooth pulled, since the more I read about cracked teeth and root canals, there are no guarantees. If I do get the tooth pulled, that should cure the infection, right?  After 3 years of constantly be aware of this tooth, Id like to just get rid of it. Im 62 and have had the same tooth missing on the other side for 30+ years and have not missed it.  And as others have said, thank you so much for the information you share with everyone.  I have learned so much from reading all the posts here this evening. Users/SueDen
