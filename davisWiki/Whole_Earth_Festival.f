The Whole Earth Festival (WEF), an ASUCD unit, is a huge, FREE, ecofriendly threeday music, dance, arts, crafts and education festival which takes place in Spring during Mothers Day Weekend.  Its the closest thing to Woodstock we have. Its a mustsee Davis event. Tons of folks who are committed to sustainable living and environmental harmony make a pilgrimage to Davis for the WEF, and the UC Davis The Quad Quad area is lined with art & craft tents, music acts, massage tables, food and a child care area. Various workshops occur throughout the weekend as well. Of all the festivals that take place on campus, this is one of the most organized. Volunteering is quite the experience, plus you get a free shirt if you do.


The WEF uses hundreds of volunteers (known as Karma Patrol) for the festival. If you want to eat some good food from our garden mixed up by the CoHo and get a dank shirt for free, you should come out to the volunteer meetings. They are held every Wednesday of Spring Quarter up on the second floor of the Memorial Union. They are workshop/info/community oriented with free food and a knowledge sharing from all ends...

If you want a booth or your band wants to play, January is the month to contact the WEF. The WEF office is located in 260 South Silo and shares an office with the Experimental College.

A little known fact is that Whole Earth Festival is one of the few ASUCD units that receives no subsidy. To put it in perspective, Picnic Day (another annual UCD event) receives over $20,000 a year in funding from student fees. WEF is selfsufficient.

Many people partake of Marijuana at this event. If you wish to use mindaltering substances at this event, please refrain from drinking alcohol. You see, the stoned swagger and the drunken swagger are opposites of each other. If you get drunk while others are stoned, youll run into people and nobody will be happy. If everyone tokes up, everyone swaggers the same way and collisions are avoided!  In the words of the prophet Dylan, everybody must get stoned!.

In reality, all kind of mind altering substances are taken, and a good portion of the crowd are wandering around just enjoying the event sober.  Some of the activities and information being imparted are worth enjoying and taking in with an alert mind.


Some cool history is http://asucd.ucdavis.edu/wholeearthfestival/ here, and over 30 years of photos are online at the http://wef.ucdavis.edu/old/wefhistory/wefhistory.htm WEF photo archive.

 Unique things to check out 
  Every year a man comes with a cart full of Peace pendants that he gives out for free (suggested donation minimum $1). He never stays in the same place at the festival. He makes hundreds of pendants each year and hes expanded his collection to include the word Peace in other languages. Keep an eye out for him.
    The man can be sighted elsewhere too.  From Humboldt to Gay Pride in SF.  I make a habit of giving one back to him whenever I see him and taking a new one. Users/ChristopherMckenzie
  Chocolate covered frozen fruit. Enough said.
  Beach Hair Accessories; theres a woman that collects metal beach trash and makes it into fine jewelry and hair accessories. A little pricey, but well worth the lifetime warranty. If you break anything that you buy from her, all you have to do is send it back and shell weld it again for you!
  The Recycling and compost Composting effort is very successful. In 2004, only 420lb (3.5%) of  the festivals waste went to the landfill. The rest was recycled or composted.
  Most people do not realize that every item that is thrown away at WEF is eventually dumped onto a large table and sorted by a volunteer. While this may not sound like an appealing idea at first, it is actually one of the most entertaining and coveted volunteer positions. Try it out, you might even find a Groundscore groundscore. Its amazing what some people throw away.
  The dish system is like no other. When you buy food, you pay an extra dollar for the plate. To get you dollar back, you return the dish to one of the 2 dish return sites on either side of the quad.
  The Whole Earth Reusables Cooperative (WERC) runs the dish program for the weekend. It is one of only a few of its kind, and in some aspects is making waves on the campus, and in the festival / event world. Everyone from those damn hoopies to Camtroller and the 3rd floor ASUCDers are using the plates...
  Have a seat on the Whole Earth Bench bench that was made during the 2004 Whole Earth Festival.
  The Students for an Orwellian Society attended in 2004, attempting to convince everyone at the Festival that they should avoid drugcrime and sexcrime.  As expected, the response was less than enthusiastic.  However, its quite amusing to see an Orwellian trying to convince a hippie that fascism is the way to go for more than half an hour.
  In 2004, KDRT broadcasted live from the festival for the first time, a tradition that will assuredly continue into the future.
  There is a drum circle of epic proportions.
  Watch for an wiki:wikipedia:Ananda_Marga booth!




 Things lost to time 


  In the pit of Wellman Hall there was a DJ Stage that played all day and til 10pm at night... Known as the Sunken Garden some years and other years simply as the pit, it has some kind sound down there.  Alas, in 2011, there was a reported beating, sexual assault of a 14 year old and rape of a 16 year old. UC Davis http://blogs.sacbee.com/crime/archives/2011/05/ucdavistoshu.html decided to close the doors on the DJ stage before the investigation was even complete. Fred Wood, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs wrote in a public statement, we are sending message that people cannot come to our campus and behave this way.


20041211 19:12:53 nbsp The WEF was originally an art class project. They used to have a LOT of free stuff going on in the booths during the Seventies, but now its devolved into more or less a holistic arts and crafts fair, where most booths are about making a profit. That said, its still a fun festival (often held on Mothers Day weekend) and students and nonstudents alike should attend at least once.  Users/CentralDavisite

  While WEF has evolved over time, Whole Earth Festival is THE best festival to go to in Davis. While the outer ring of the festival is largely dedicated to arts, crafts and food vendors of a sustainable nature; the INNER ring of the festival is all about FREEdom and fun. A few of us realized in 2006 after participating in Davis Art and Revolution, that there is seemingly two festivals going on at once, one outer about commerce which we all need and one inner about exploring oneself and finding a truer meaning to life that does not require money. Users/MorganTorngrenTatman

20041219 16:07:43 nbsp WEF is actually a Non Profit itself. The booths do make a bit of cash, but the folks who are selling the crafts are mostly families who need such income to support themselves, as this is all they do. This is completely different than any usual holistic arts and crafts faire. For many, this is the first festival of the spring and a lot of these folks have been strapped for income for months by the time they get out to the UCD quad. I would think it is more of an educational event, educating all on an alternative lifestyle with a  focus on lessening our communal impact on the earth in a variety of ways through our everyday actions...   Users/MikeyNolan

  While I agree with Mikey that the goal of the event is education about life alternatives for folks, the reality for the casual participant is a big arts and crafts fair.  Which is nice enough, but not the spirituallifechangingevent that some would like it to be.  Users/Rocksanddirt

20050121 11:18:00 nbsp Witnessing the orwellians at last years WEF gave me a whole new respect for the organization as well as a strengthened sense of irony. Users/DanMasiel

  Personal faves: Soular Dance Stage, talk with crafters, hug a KPer, play (disc/sack/juggle/your choice) while listening to a band.
  My fave:  join the KARMA PATROL and help make the Festival happen!

20080509 19:23:19 nbsp Oh why, oh why do I have to work during all the cool events? Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080510 15:13:38 nbsp I heard that they are forcing vendors to close at 6pm with threat to fine them if they dont.  Seems sorta lame to close up so early when people are still out there... Users/SunjeetBaadkar
  Dont believe everything you hear. In this case, it was true about closing craft and education booths at 6 PM (probably will be in 2009, too), but fines? Ha! The idea (I believe) is that as the focus shifts to the stages, its pretty hard to keep the chaos controlled and any security going if vending is still going on. If the booths shut, then the Karma Patrol can concentrate on stages & keeping the crowd happy. It probably does quash a few sales, but makes the event as a whole more manageable. Users/DougWalter

20080510 16:43:41 nbsp we went late morning/early afternoon, and it didnt seem nearly as busy or patronized as it has in years past. There were significantly less vendors there than I remembered, and the crowds werent very big.  Users/ElleWeber

20090125 20:44:01 nbsp The first one was called Whole Earth Week and like the name says, lasted a whole week. I went there every day and even got out of my 6th grade class for one whole day of it to participate and be part of a parade that went someplace downtownmaybe on 3rd Streetand back to the quad. The article calls it the closest thing to Woodstock Davis has which is accurate enough in common parlance but I think its fun to note that Whole Earth Week actually predates Woodstock by four or five months! I recently saw a Peter Max poster for the 1970 Whole Earth Week for sale on the internet. Its pretty cool. Whole Earth continued as a weeklong event for at least a couple of years and changed flavor very distinctly yearbyyear, reflecting changes in popular culture in interesting ways. Back then I was sure that soon we would all be living in geodesic domes; in harmony with the earth and each other. It seemed so obvious. Users/JohnBaker

20090511 18:41:19 nbsp I was playing saxophone with another saxophonist and a flautist in a drum circle at the 2009 festival. If anyone has any pictures, they would be much appreciated, since I didnt bring my camera to the festival. Email is amsamson@ucdavis.edu

  Thanks! Users/AaronSamson

20100419 07:47:27 nbsp While I can respect and even admire some of the things the majority seem to stand for in this event, I can not understand why they have no respect or understanding of others needs and others personal space during it. The scent of funk is everywhere and, as much as they desire a clean environment, they seem to do more to harm it than to help it on each visit. This accompanied by the rapid increase in theft and other crime in town make me believe it would be better to not have this celebration at all. Users/WesOne
  I like how they decide that the event is environmentally friendly because of the small amount of waste going to landfills when http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling#Criticism recycling pollutes as well. Theres nothing wrong with going out and having fun, but people should know that just having fun usually means there will be environmental damage. Of course, I really enjoy the nice and quiet aspect of Davis, so would not mind being without Picnic Day or Whole Earth Festival. Users/hankim
  There is no free lunch.  There is a cost to everything and recycling does require energy, etc.  However, it costs energy and resources to make a new cup just like it costs to recycle said cup.  Recycling is (99% of the time) more environmental friendly than throwing things away. Users/DagonJones
  WesOne refers to the rapid increase in theft and other crime in town. Please cite your sources. There is always a postevent meeting with all the folks involved in organizing WEF (including City and UCD police), and I havent heard reports from them about any WEFrelated crime wave.  There are usually a few drunks arrested during the 3day event, but not much else.  (And Id expect that of any large/rock concert.)  Thanks. LoisRichter

20110411 21:51:05 nbsp The organizing committee would like to know about any off site problems during that weekend.
We are aware that we have a social as well as an ecological footprint.  Bringing more people into town has an effect.
We can weigh the refuse that goes in various directions and meter the amps that we use to measure the ecological footprint.
But to gauge the off site impact of having a festival, the staff has to hope that people who are bothered that weekend complain to us. Hopefully with something specific. Users/MichaelErickson

20110505 16:55:47 nbsp I had a lovely time at the Whole Earth Festival last year, and I cant wait to attend again this weekend!  I thoroughly enjoyed the frozen chocolate bananas from Joy & Taylors Raw Chocolates, and I even bought some really nice  and handmade!  jewelry for my mother for Mothers Day.  If youre on the fence, definitely go.  The spectacle alone is worth it. Users/LilyRosamond

20130512 16:28:54 nbsp Honestly some of it is kind of creepy. People get wasted and high, the food is ridiculously expensive, and theres very little regulation and security. Its a very spiritual festival with people claiming they can solve your problems with a crystal (true story) or that if you drink this elixer you will be all better. Some of the activities are orgylike.  Users/AnBan
