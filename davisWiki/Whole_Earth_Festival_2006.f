20060514 14:34:00 nbsp The prices did seem high, and the organic rootbeer was no good. But that organic corndog; best corndog Ive ever had, seriously. The giant earth ball was awesome, too. Users/JohnDudek

20060514 15:56:17 nbsp If Hippies are so open and loving why do I get nasty looks for walking through wearing khakis and a polo. I smell hypocrisy! And dirty feet.... Users/JonathanNasca

20060514 17:31:22 nbsp Try walking around with a popped collar and aviators. Users/AdamBarr

20060514 21:12:15 nbsp You wont get nasty looks if you dress in hippydrag (tiedye, lots of beads, unwashed hair).  I twirled around in the most pit with a friend while wearing wornout cords and my grungiest tshirt, and no one suspected a thing.  Users/AnnaHamilton

20060515 08:47:19 nbsp so, was there any sort of educational/inspiration presentation?  or has it become the dixon may fair for neohippies? Users/BorregoJohn

20060516 11:53:14 nbsp Fucking hippies.  First a guy sitting on my lawn with his puppy tells me We dont let people touch our puppy, or else it will turn into a goofball dog.  Yeah, well I dont let stoner freaks who dont know how to take care of animals sit on my lawn.  Then after the days festivities I find an Odwalla veggie power bar wrapper and sierra nevada bottle on my lawn.  Fucking hippies.  More like the Lets get stoned and preach to others about crap we dont even pactice Festival. Users/JeffSpeckles

20070518 22:13:54 nbsp For your information, of the 13,000 pounds of garbage produced at the festival, only 360 pounds actually went to the landfill. The rest (over 97%) of it was recycled or composted by the volunteers of the festival.   Users/DerekDowney
