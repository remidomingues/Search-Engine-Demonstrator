20080510 16:45:02 nbsp we went late morning/early afternoon, and it didnt seem nearly as busy or patronized as it has in years past. There were significantly less vendors there than I remembered, and the crowds werent very big. Users/ElleWeber

20080510 19:17:04 nbsp I was there at about 2 pm on Saturday and it was busy as all heck. Lines everywhere and really hard to move around through the vendors shops. I was impressed at the amount of people and how well it was planned :) Users/BrandonBarrette
