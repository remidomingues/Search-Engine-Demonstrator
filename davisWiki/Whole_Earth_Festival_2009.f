The 40th annual Whole Earth Festival on the UC Davis Quad happened on May 8, 9 and 10 (Mothers Day Weekend) of the year 2009. This years theme, Sustainalovability, pervaded the psycosphere around the Quad, infusing minds with thoughts of love, ability and sustaining our planet while we celebrate spring on this part of Earth.
