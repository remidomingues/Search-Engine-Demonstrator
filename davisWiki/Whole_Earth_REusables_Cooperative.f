The Whole Earth REusables Cooperative is a wonderful program that supplies reusable dishes free of charge in order to reduce waste.

Its affiliated with lots of different environmental organizations on campus. These include but are not limited to: R4 Recycling, Project Compost and the Whole Earth Festival.
