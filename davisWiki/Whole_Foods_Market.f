Whole Foods Market is located at the former Borders site in Davis Commons.

They have a monthly events calendar, coincidentally similar to what Borders had.

Whole Foods actively purports to practice corporate responsibility. It prioritizes local and organic products, actively supports GMO labeling and does not use GMOs in its private label products, has a national goal to reach zero waste (supported by reusable deli ware and postconsumer composting in its store), and has a Whole Planet Foundation that supports social, economic and environmental efforts around the world (including a new microfinance fund focused on supplier communities).  Additionally, Whole Foods employees, like those at several other Supermarkets & Grocery Stores Davis supermarkets, are paid above minimum wage, the top earner is restricted to http://www2.wholefoodsmarket.com/blogs/jmackey/2006/11/02/compensationatwholefoodsmarket/ 19X the lowest paid salary (compare this to the average CEO at 400X the lowest salary) and the company has been placed in the top 100 to work for by Fortune magazine (only 15 places below Nugget Market on the http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/bestcompanies/2011/full_list/ 2011 list!) for over two decadesoften listed in the top 10.

Their cofounder and current CEO, John Mackey, is said to be to antiunion and antistate health insurance. In 2009, he wrote a http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204251404574342170072865070.html controversial editorial against the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health_insurance_option public health insurance option.  He eventually resigned as chairman of the board, largely due to public pressures surrounding the editorial.  Mackey maintains the position of coCEO with Walter Robb, a longtime veteran of the company. In a recent interview (1/16/2013) he compared the new health care laws to fascism.  He also refuses to accept the scientific consensus on climate change.

They carry Daviss own BRÜBAR Energy Bars and many other local and regional products.

The store recently expanded into the former Jamba Juice location and has seating and tables for eating and working. Whole Foods offers free Wifi in two hour increments contingent on a minimum $5 purchase. You have to ask a cashier for a code and show your receipt if you did not get the code during your purchase. Fortunately, some other unrestricted Wifi networks are accessilble, so one need not depend on the exiguous largesse of Whole Foods.

 Construction and Opening Timeline 

Construction Management & Builders, Inc. was the general contractor for the project.

Anticipated construction start: April 16, 2012. Target completion: September 28, 2012. Grand opening October 24, 2012.

 Store snapshot 

According to a http://www.davisenterprise.com/localnews/wholefoodsconfirmsleaseatdaviscommons/ Davis Enterprise article and store visits:

 Store features a good sized produce department, compact but comprehensive bulk, comprehensive grocery (shelf stable, refrig, frozen), specialty cheese, butcher with custom cuts, seafood (all with good ratings from Marine Stewardship Council), extensive wine and beer, body care/wellness, and more...and the best chocolate selection in Davis (lots of organic and ethically traded, at the best prices in Davis).
 The store features a large prepared foods area and lots of grabandgo items. The deli has groovy sign fixtures made from old bike parts. The salad/hot bar selections are extensive and they have reusable eat ware for those who want to dine alfresco at the Davis Commons. From 79 AM, they have an early bird discount for the hot bar.
 Theyre excited to take advantage of the large grassy area out in front with the seating thats already there, and the side patio with Arboretum plants.  They want to increase the amount of bike parking, and potentially do bicycle delivery, which they already do in some of their other locations.
 This is a smaller store for Whole Foods. They are expecting to have their share of the market, but they dont need it to be dominant in the market.  They think there’s enough pie to go around, and hope to turn some of the shoppers who arent currently natural food shoppers into natural food shoppers, which would help other natural grocers.
 Prices are competitive with other local natural foods stores (as of Nov. 2012). They have many unadvertised sale prices and a monthly coupon guide; you can sign up for online delivery to save trees.
 They donate five cents to a community organization, such as the UC Davis Arboretum, for each reusable bag customer use  so brings bags to support good causes.

 The Question of Genetically Modified Organisms GMOs 

Whole Foods announced that it will require labeling of products with GMOs by 2018. They have not stated http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/blog/gmolabelingcomingwholefoodsmarket how they will verify supplier claims, however.  Also, Whole Foods has signed on to the http://www.foe.org/gefreeseafood Friends of the Earth Pledge for GEFree Seafood, which asks grocers to commit to the following: It is our policy to not knowingly purchase or sell GMOs genetically engineered (GE) salmon or other GE seafood, should it come to market.

Although the Whole Foods model is to sell food that is natural and/or organic, and they do not use GMOs in their private label products, they http://foodfreedom.wordpress.com/2011/01/27/organicelitesurrenderstomonsanto/ effectively condoned the USDAs “conditional deregulation” of Monsanto’s genetically engineered, herbicideresistant alfalfa.  Whole Foods has http://blog.wholefoodsmarket.com/2011/01/noregulationsgealfalfa/ defended their decision as the only alternative to complete deregulation.  This never meant Whole Foods endorsed GMOs GE foods or was planning to stock the alfalfa.

Whole Foods, along with every other food store in town such as  Safeway, Nugget, SaveMart, Trader Joes, and the Davis Food Coop, does carry select GM foods, since all carry conventionallygrown soy, corn and canola products. Some processed foods are http://www.nongmoproject.org/productverification/searchparticipatingproducts/ certified to be NonGMO, but these are the exception as, http://www.ers.usda.gov/Data/BiotechCrops/ 6095% of the crops grown in the US are GM.  The only way to avoid that is to stop consuming these products entirely and buy organic foods. While consumers can make that choice, few retail grocery stores have adopted http://thebigcarrot.ca/index.php?id227 that policy due to the high volume of goods containing soy/corn/canola.


20111029 11:13:53 nbsp Seems like it would be a small space for a Whole Foods... theyre usually pretty large. And parking would be a nightmare.  Users/CovertProfessor
  A friend suggested it might be like their smaller http://wholefoodsmarket.com/stores/petaluma/ Petaluma store. The person who signed the lease may not have tried driving to and parking in the Davis Commons lot. Of course, not everyone drives to a food market. Users/DougWalter
   True, but I dont tend to see a lot of bikes at Davis Commons.  I think most either drive or are walking over from someplace else downtown.   Users/CovertProfessor
     Oh uh.. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v2UFc1pr2yUU its getting real in the Whole Foods parking lot.

20111029 16:14:33 nbsp yes please! Users/OliviaY

20111031 11:53:12 nbsp Seriously??!? This is such a bad idea. Parking is so bad there, and arent there already a bunch of grocery stores downtown? They shouldve put in an Urban Outfitters. Users/kristineg

20111031 13:05:02 nbsp Regardless of the parking, I think this would be great! They sell a lot of (good) gluten free items I just cant get anywhere else, and I hate treking to Sac for it. I have to say, I stopped parking in that lot a long time ago, but still frequent the businesses there. Ive committed to just parking at the northwest corner of downtown and making the 5 minute walk. Plus, I never buy enough at WF to not be able to carry my groceries that far.  Users/AmLin

20111101 00:52:00 nbsp Im just glad its not a clothing store. If this puts the Coop out of business, I for one wont cry. I could never afford to pay $6 for a jar of peanut butter anyway. If Whole Foods is even moderately affordable Ill be happy. Users/ScottMeehleib

20111101 08:08:22 nbsp Hah! I had never set foot in a Whole Foods until just a couple months ago. I was shocked at the prices. The CoOp is a tad less expensive, but not by much. Im really surprised there hasnt been any oposition from the CoOp on this, or is there? I agree, parking would be a nightmare too. Im sure Plutos wont like this too because Whole Foods has similar items at their takeaway/buffet section. Users/jsbmeb
 Im not clear if prices are lower or higher. Users/BruceHansen
  Well, the store does have the nickname Whole Paycheck.  However, some people claim that if you buy the Whole Foods brand (with the name 365), the prices are actually pretty good.  I havent shopped at Whole Foods often enough to know if that is true or not.   Users/CovertProfessor
   Perhaps because the Whole Foods brand sources many of its organic products from China:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?featureplayer_embedded&vMBiI9KcJ9UY Users/clester

20111102 06:30:25 nbsp Yes parking is a problem.  It seems to me that with the upcoming 5th Street redesign narrowing of Fifth Street for cars it will become more of a parking lot, but not for long enough to allow people to shop at the Davis Food Coop Food Coop or the further away WFM.  Users/BruceHansen

20111102 09:43:31 nbsp The fact of being a cooperative is a far better advantage to the Davis Food Coop for me than whether their food is organic or not, or gmo or not. In my opinion, (anti)gmo and organic are hype and Whole Foods is built on that hype. The true advantage of food sold at farmers markets is better quality control because of a smaller supply chain and fewer workers in smaller farms. These advantages just arent available at a corporate octopus chain like Whole Foods like they are at the CoOp and the Farmers Market. Chains like Safeway and Savemart have economies of scale which is why I shop at those stores (in addition to not living by the CoOp anymore :( ), but Whole Foods doesnt provide this either. Dont believe the hype! Users/NickSchmalenberger

20111102 23:18:22 nbsp Whole Foods definitely runs on the expensive side.  To support that, they only place their stores in neighborhoods with an average income of at least $50,000 a year.  (Or at least that used to be the case.  I dont know if this is still true, and given that undergrads (half the population of Davis) have an income much lower than that, it might not be true at all any more.)  The Borders space really does seem too small for a store like that.  Maybe if they took over one or two of the neighboring spaces too? Users/IDoNotExist

20111102 23:19:39 nbsp Actually their policy isnt based on income, but the percentage of the population in a city that are college graduates. Users/OliviaY

20111103 11:54:34 nbsp If you really think you need this, then you dont realize what you already have for choices. Seriously, theres nothing you cant already get at the CoOp, Nugget, and Traders and for cheaper than what you can get at the properly termed Whole Paycheck. Between Traders and the CoOp, there are more good GF options than you can find at Whole Foods, believe me Ive compared. Plus the CoOp test kitchen has classes on making the hard things like GF breads and cakes. All youre going to get with this are outoftowners that want to go to a BIG LABEL store, filling up what is already a congested intersection. I came from an area where Whole Foods and Safeway were our only options, I had to drive an hour just to get to SF Rainbow CoOp where things were cheaper than whole paycheck... Ive been soo happy to be back near Davis where there are more options. Im sad this seemed like the best option for Davis Commons... Youve got some good storefronts/restaurants there already, I dont think this will complement. Users/elizabethweitzel
  I agree the location seems horrible, but there are a LOT of things I cant find anywhere but whole foods.  Specifically specialty baked good items and whole chunk chocolate for baking.  Ive looked in every store in town for certain items and the only places Ive ever gotten them were WF.oy

   My opinion is that you wont find them at this smaller store, once it opens.  They will not have an onsite Bakery, and are unlikely to haul specialty baked goods from a central one for the two GF cakes per month they will sell.  rocksanddirt

20111103 21:54:12 nbsp I dont understand how Davis is going to support another grocery store ... and especially one thats downtown where shopping and eating in restaurants takes place. I wouldnt ever go to Davis Commons just for Whole Foods  parking is awful and its too far of a bike ride from anyplace I would live. The only way I can see using this place is if I dont feel up to Plutos or some other Davis eatery, but it doesnt sound like the prices would justify Whole Foods over a decent Davis meal. We have great, highend grocery stores already. IN ANY CASE  they can try, and if it fails, well no loss here.  Users/ChristyMarsden
  Theres a good chance that this additional competition will lead to the closing of one or two grocery stores in Davis. Its unlikely that WF will be the first: they are a very successful chain and have lots of money. They have closed 16 stores in the past three years, but have started 51 http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/company/pdfs/2010_10k.pdf according to their SEC 10K report for 2010.

20111122 15:04:09 nbsp to the person about the whole chunk chocolate, I saw some at nuggets on covell, the one near the carls jr and CVS. :) Users/SherrineLau
  They carry during the holiday season but not any other time of the year.  Thanks though. oy
   I saw chunks of white chocolate at the food coop when I was there yesterday. I wasnt looking for it, but from that I would assume that they also carry chunk milk and/or dark chocolate. Users/knaggers

20121025 11:46:06 nbsp This morning my wife and I decided to survey the new Whole Foods.  Its easy to determine the targeted demographic of a business by the canned music they play.  Today I heard Jackson Brown, Savoy Brown, The Beatles, etc.  It sounded good to me, and as someone who attended High School and College in the 1970s I must be in that demographic sweetspot.  There were very few University students in the store and I wasnt sure if the 40year old music or the high prices were driving them away.

I may be wrong, but I project a long, hard road before the Davis location realizes a profit.  There are just too many affordable and competitive options in town including Trader Joes, Grocery Outlet and the CoOp. Users/RickJeff

20121028 16:13:11 nbsp Beware: the smallest container available for soup from the hot food line turned out to be $7. The perpound prices for everything else (salad bar, hot food) is on par with Nugget and Coop. Users/MeggoWaffle

20121111 23:49:49 nbsp Ive been checking in the past few months with Coop managers and employees about their whole take on WFs obviously weird choice of location and what is the Coop doing to stay alive? Apparently the Coops survive and thrive plan took effect back when TJs was coming into town, so they already had quite a bit of momentum facing this new competitor. One Coop manager said that its probable WF plans to take a loss on this location, but it will be worth it to them to get UCD students with $ hooked as brand shoppers when they graduate and move on. Makes sense to me. Frankly, I think the competition has done the Coop good in many ways, namely customer service being 10000X better and less pricing everything like its goldplated, like asparagus for $13/lb, and more community involvement with food fairs and booths and whatnot. I personally will keep supporting the Coop and would go out of my way to pick them over WF even if WF didnt exist in the most overcrowded parking lot by the longest light in Davis.
Apparently theres been delivery snags, too, since residents of the 1st street houses were complaining about the noise. Coop gets their pallets delivered around 4:305 am, but for noise restrictions WF has to wait until 6 and kinda dump everything in the parking lot since theres no delivery bays. Nice.  Users/LilyS

20121118 17:16:56 nbsp FYI for everybody who complains about parking there. I was at Whole Foods this afternoon and there were dozens of spots open. Then I stopped by Trader Joes and had to park over by The Grad.

Things they have that the Coop no longer carries: Alexia Garlic Baguettes. SO GOOD. More expensive than the Coop used to charge.

Things they dont carry that they should: Tofurky roasts. Can be found at the coop, overpriced even when on sale. Users/MeggoWaffle

20130110 19:55:58 nbsp Has everyone forgotten that Davis is the bicycle city? Urban outfitters has many locations in highly urban areas where parking is plentiful...hence the name.  Users/YesItsMe


20130718 16:59:45 nbsp I am very happy with Whole Foods Market. Granted: you have to park somewhere and sometimes you have to drive an additional street (or two), but I find this a terrific store. Maybe they will solve this issue too with a parking.

Most products I buy, are cheaper here at WFM than they are at Davis CoOp (sorry to say that), and I notice that CoOp is losing me (gradually). Some products are even a dollar cheaper.

They have excellent cheap cooling (fabric)bags too (in different sizes), and I already bought three of them because they come in super handy (because they are square) and they even look cool in different colors. CoOp doesnt offer that kind of extra stuff and Whole Foods has loads of it at the checkouts. This is somehow quite important to me, because I buy frozen and cooled stuff all the time, and I was very grateful that WFM is thinking along.

When I am right about it, I think Whole Foods has more in terms of assortment (we are vegan, and maybe this is only so for vegans, I dont know).

Why am I making this obvious comparison with CoOp? Well, I used to buy all our health and vegan food at CoOp, now I buy the bulk of it at Whole Foods, simply because they are cheaper and to me it seems they have more. I think CoOp should be very aware of this, I think I am not the only one whos switching over to Whole Foods. Probably I am very naive, but maybe they can work together in future? But I sure hope with Whole Food prices, not with CoOp prices.

CoOp is anyway too expensive, I regularly see things there that are one or even two dollars more than elsewhere (for example, readymade soup suppers). This is not encouraging me to shop at Davis CoOp, but at Whole Foods.

I know: competition is a tough thing, but Whole Foods is a very strong newcomer.

Anecdote: not long ago, CoOp called me with a survey and I participated, finding it very coincidental (because I was thinking about them, losing me). Of course, I still do a little shopping at CoOp, but like I said... Well, this guy was asking questions and I was answering them, and to my surprise NONE of the questions was about the pricing. IMO that should be the first question (figuratively speaking), because it all comes down to that for quite some people (I think, anyway, but maybe some people dont care about throwing out their money lol). At the end of the survey, he asked: Do you have any comments you would like to add? (something like that), and THEN I made my own remark about the pricing. He didnt seem to take my own remarks very seriously, because he was a little hasty about it.

Maybe I should add this comment to CoOp as well...

One remark for Whole Foods Market (ánd for CoOp as well): where oh where are the Soya Desserts? The ones (small and big sizes) I used to buy, havent been there for months now. Both Whole Food Market and CoOp only offer Nancys Soy desserts that, and I am sorry to say, taste  HORRIBLE, and so is the color: dirty light brown with speckles. Yes, I like natural, but please!, the eye wants something too. And yes, I tried several of Nancys vegan dessert. I find them so bad, I had to throw them away (my husband was willing to eat one of mine lol, but he is a less highly demanding eater). Users/ConstantiaOomen

  Just FYI: When someone calls you and says theyre doing a survey of _ for _, dont assume its true. Often theyre someone hired by a competitor to get information. Users/SteveDavison

@Users/SteveDavison
Thats an interesting way to look at it. I hadnt thought of it. What should they do, let you call back (CoOp) to confirm its really them?
In this case, I believe it was CoOp; the lack of questions about the prices I found consistent with the prices themselves. ☺ Users/ConstantiaOomen

20140124 21:41:52 nbsp Everyone might want to go over to the wiki page on Jamba Juice for a little more info suggesting that WF is a predatory corporate sleaze, for one thing forcing out JJ, who knows what else.  Users/JaneBF

20140606 09:58:34 nbsp The coffee bar has good coffee but they just raised the prices and they are now absolutely ridiculous.  $3.75 for a large iced coffee is out of the question, a few weeks ago it was $2, I felt insulted last time I went in.  I will be going to Cloud Forest where it is still a fair $2 Users/DagonJones
