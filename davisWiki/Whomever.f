Formed in 2000 by Darren Reid aka DARyL and Users/EricWecker Eric Wecker aka The Wiz, whomever is about questioning the assumptions people live by (in a dope hip hop style, of course). When the group formed, DARyL was down in Santa Barbara playing with his band El Jefe and Wiz was enjoying the Hiphop scene Davis hiphop scene. Things have changed, but whomever is still at it. Both DARyL and Wiz are in a new local hip hop band, Davis Joint Unified, so youll be seeing them around.
