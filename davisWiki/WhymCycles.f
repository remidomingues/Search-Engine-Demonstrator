 WhymCycles are creative bicycles made by Davis resident and mechanical wizard, Peter Wagner. For more information and photos on WhymCycles, see this video UCDs Lone Twin town criers, hired by the Mondavi, April 2009: http://www.youtube.com/watch?vgR9lbgUC2tk. They can be seen at events like Picnic Day , Here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?vSMnMdEMrXdc&featurerelated with Peter here in the lead..and the Whole Earth Festival. His creations are also at various kinetic sculpture races.

Is the really really REALLY tall bike also a WhymCycle?  If so, how do you get up on it?  And down?
Peter here..Tall bikes go back over 100 years, to the lamplighters bikes for early gaslamp streetlights.
Heres a clip from 1939 with many great cycles, tall ones near the end:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?vjdlpJqHxLxk.
Tallies usually have pegs or steps on the left side to assist mounting & dismounting.
I call all my creations Whymcycles now. tho the bouncers are the real whymsies to me.

So Ive seen you on a bike that must have been at least 20 feet tall.  I didnt see you get on it or off it.  How do you get up there?!
