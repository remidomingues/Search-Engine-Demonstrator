Local Davis businesses are quite generous in the number of FREE wireless hotspots available to the general public as well as Public Internet Terminals. This will probably continue as long as WiFi users continue to be decent customers  it is important to avoid becoming someone who just hogs up space without buying anything in some reasonable interval. Also be mindful of others who share your connection: massive use of bandwidth (such as peertopeer programs) hurt the others that share the connection. Ironically, the larger chains in town require their customers to pay for access, while small business owners in town typically offer it without charge.

Interested in mapping the wifi networks of Davis? Drop me a line. Initial work http://casoilresource.lawr.ucdavis.edu/drupal/node/288 here.

A Google Maps http://hotspotr.com/wifi/map/701davisca mashup provides a nice view of WiFi hotspots in different locations, although more data needs to be added for hotspots in Davis  you can help. Also, http://corp.fon.com/en Fon has a searchable map that lists a dozen or so http://corp.fon.com/en/fonspots/ Fon Hotspots in Davis.

A PushPin Map of http://deadcellzones.com mashup provides a view of cell phone dead zone locations and more data needs to be added for poor coverage areas in Davis.
 Security 

Most public wireless networks do not use encryption. This means that if the websites youre accessing dont use encryption (i.e. their addresses dont start with https), anyone else with a computer close by can see everything you send and receive. Some websites such as facebook and all wiki:wikispot:Front_Page wikispot wikis use encryption for just login information so that while somebody could read everything youre doing online, they cant get your user name and password. MySpace does not use any encryption so you might want to hold off reading your messages and such until you get to a place with wired internet or encrypted wireless (such as at home). Most bank websites use encryption. Just check for the https. Gmail uses encryption for your entire email session. However, the person receiving email from you might be not be using Gmail.

One exception is Instaconnect they put everyone behind a massive public IP thereby hiding your IP address. They make everyone create an account which means that to access your account or information you have to be on your computer with your MAC address, and have to know your login and password. The down side is having to create an account when all you really want to do is get online, but you only have to do it once and most places downtown can see Instaconnect hotspots.

One way to secure all your web traffic is to securely to connect to a wiki:wikipedia:Proxy_server web proxy. If youre a UC Davis affiliate, you can create an ISUN account and tunnel all your web traffic through there. Check out the aforementioned ISUN page for instructions on setting up a tunnel on nix systems.

Before doing any credit (or debit) card transaction online, you should always make sure the connection is encrypted. You can see that it is if the address starts with https (rather than just http, which is not encrypted). This is regardless of whether you are using a public WiFi network or your own at home. And you should never use a public computer for this  it may have a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystroke_logging key logger on it, which tracks everything you type, including passwords, credit card numbers, etc.

Be careful when logging in to password protected networks. Some evil people will set up fake names on their networks and try to capture your user IDs and password. For example, they will call their network Xfinity Free Wifi and then when you log in they will steal  your user ID and password. Free Wifi should be open and it should not ask you for an ID or a password.

20070302 15:05:42 nbsp Id like to help map the wifi networks.  As of this moment (20070302 3:04pm) the above link doesnt work.  I havent removed it because it may just be a temporary thing.  I was wondering how we could go about combining wireless info.  I noticed the current maps were made using Kismet.  Last time I checked I couldnt use my serial port in Linux on my laptop (for my GPS).  Im sure theres a way we could combine it with a NetStumbler file though.  Ill also try a newer version of linux and see if I can get my serial port working. Users/BradBenedict
 There are a couple of good USB/serial converters that are known to work with Linux. http://www.pfranc.com/usb/Linux/serialadapter.htm Heres one example. Users/ArlenAbraham
 HP OEM cables can be found all over the place, and they are quite compatible.  I use one for my Palm IIIc. Users/JabberWokky

20070307 15:17:02 nbsp Yeah, I actually have a serial to USB converter, but I have yet to try it.  I think I got the GPS working, but I somehow broke the madwifi drivers now.  Anyway, I was thinking kismet/gpsmap make better maps than pretty much anything that Ive seen map NetStumbler, but not as many people would be able to join in on the wardriving cause they dont know how to run nix or have incompatible hardware or whatever. Users/BradBenedict
 I can make googleearth density maps if given the data...  http://www.geoqo.org GeoQO can read wigle data, and other data types, and produce google earth density plots like is seen on the Geocaching page. Users/WesHardaker
 I wish I saw this a couple years ago when I drove all of Mace Ranch just for the hell of it.  I collected it with NetStumbler, and then mapped it with MapPoint.  I wouldnt mind helping out.  Users/DavidGrundler

 Still have the stumbler files?  If so, send em to me! Users/WesHardaker
 If I do, they are on an old laptop.  Ill look tonight.  Users/DavidGrundler

20080201 20:26:28 nbsp Maps and lists of wireless accessible locations can be found here: http://wireless.ucdavis.edu/maps.cfm Users/carlaisnt
 If Im not mistaken, the wireless access points on campus require a UC Davis computer account, so I wouldnt call them generally accessible. Furthermore, that information is already linked from the MOObilenet page that describes in more detail how it is different from more public or open networks. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20080428 08:49:10 nbsp I made the original maps posted here. I would suggest a combination of Kismet, Python, and GRASS for map making. They are all open source apps that run on just about any nonbroken (i.e. Windows) platform. If anyone is still interested I can post the updated scripts for deconstructing the Kismet log files for use in your favorite mapping application. http://casoilresource.lawr.ucdavis.edu/drupal/node/470 some more details, and http://casoilresource.lawr.ucdavis.edu/drupal/node/288 some more here. Users/DylanBeaudette

20080430 19:52:59 nbsp For UC Davis affiliates, there is now orangemesh wifi in the Segundo dorm area. Users/VTang

20080522 22:29:46 nbsp I dont believe Stones Cafe and Deli is still in business. Users/butch

20080609 17:54:10 nbsp I dont recall any wireless networks at Dos Coyotes (Marketplace). Users/RichardTrendall  Verified correct. Removed from list 1/8/11

20080711 08:40:19 nbsp I have lived at an apartment complex that had Instaconnect through Aria Communications (Solysis).  Is the City still working with them for downtown wireless?  If so, dont get your hopes up.  They were always down and it was always someone elses fault.  Customer service was horrendous (when they actually answered). Users/MirandaLerick

20100302 21:15:44 nbsp Droms Comics & Cards also has WiFi access for those interested. Users/WesOne

20130109 17:28:44 nbsp Whole Foods (formerly Borders) and Target have free wifi.  //This may be old news. Users/DavidBarnum
