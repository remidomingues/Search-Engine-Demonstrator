This should be the Wikis choice Alcohol drink.

The Wicky Wacky Woo (as it is spelled at Bar Bernardo) came on the scene in the late nineties, after a UCD Super Senior decided to extend his superness and work many many hours at Bar Bernardo which is part of Cafe Bernardo. After several months of trying to figure out a way to give his friends the most alcohol, with the best taste, for the least cost, he came upon the now infamous WikiWackyWoo. Now the subtlely powerful drink is a rite of passage for Davisites and those turning 21. There was a longrunning rumor that one could only be served two Wikis at a time, however, this has been disproven through several tests.
The original name came from the 1928 jazz song http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagasaki_(song) Nagasaki.

 Recipes 

From Bernardos:
     1/2 oz. Vodka
     1/2 oz. Gin
     1/2 oz. Rum
     1/2 oz. Tequila
     1/2 oz. Triple Sec
     1 oz. Amaretto
     1 oz. Orange Juice
     1 oz. Pineapple Juice
     1 oz. Cranberry Juice
     1/2 oz. Bacardi 151proof Rum in straw.

The Wiki is essentially a shot of 151 with a modified long island chaser. It contains a total of 4oz of alcohol for $8. (during the school year the “Wiki Wednesday” special begins after 9pm and they are $7) the average price for a well drink is $3 and at most places is an ounce, so if you were to drink the equivalent in vodka crans for example it would cost you $12. 3 is the limit… people rarely make it that far.

From http://www.barnonedrinks.com/recipes/cocktails/w/wikiwakiwoo.html BarNoneDrinks.com, the Wiki Waki Woo (pronounced the same):

     1/2 oz. Vodka
     1/2 oz. Rum
     1/2 oz. Bacardi 151proof Rum
     1/2 oz. Tequila
     1/2 oz. Triple Sec
     1 oz. Amaretto
     1 oz. Orange Juice
     1 oz. Pineapple Juice
     1 oz. Cranberry Juice

Combine all ingredients with ice and pour into a hurricane or parfait glass. Garnish with an orange slice and a cherry.


From http://mixeddrink.com/Rum/wakikiwoowoo.html MixedDrink.com, the Waikiki Woo Woo, the same idea by another name:

     1/2 oz Vodka
     1 oz Rum
     1/2 oz 151proof Rum
     1/2 oz Tequila
     1/2 oz Triple Sec
     1 oz Amaretto
     1 oz Orange Juice
     2 oz Pineapple Juice
     1 oz Cranberry Juice
     Crushed Ice

Combine all ingredients with ice and pour into a hurricane glass. Top with a pineapple ring, slice of orange, and cherry speared on a paper umbrella.

 Testimonies 
An unnamed person drank 1.5 servings of the WWW and invariably ran into his dwelling naked smelling of strong alcohol and holding a rose in between his teeth. Users/JenndelaVega Jenn


I will never drink one of these. It looks like a suicide in all the wrong ways.  Users/RobRoy


Amaretto is not for mixing!  No matter how outrageous the drink or purpose.  Users/BrandonKeene


Ive only had the drink a few times (at Bernardo), but it does seem like theyve been weaker lately. Not a high enough booze/$$ ratio. Ive never liked the taste anyway. Sickeningly sweet. The traditional way to counter the taste is to just drink it all in one shot, which actually isnt that hard with the amount of ice they use these days.  Users/CaptainRush


Back in my day, they filled the straw with 151, for an added kick.  Users/DeniseVardakas
  The 151filled straw is the key to this drink.  Drink the whole straw first (one shot of Bacardi) then keep drinking the cocktail.  The sweetness is cut by the Bacardi aftertaste.  Users/MattJurach
  Yeah I was just about to ask where the 151 in the straw was... I know an alky who went to Safeway and dropped close to 2 bills on 750ml bottles of all liquor in the WWW so he could have more than 2 or 3 or whatever. The 151 in the straw is   key. The WWW will get you hammered, quick.  Users/StevenDaubert


20050622 18:06:47 nbsp As a public service, perhaps we should create a booze/$$ ratio chart in the spirit of the good old pizza ratio page? Users/MichaelGiardina

20050623 01:24:08 nbsp Sounds good to me, that could be helpful! Users/GeorgeLewis

20050623 01:30:18 nbsp Sounds good... Ok, everyone, start going out more often to collect data, haha. Users/SummerSong

20051106 14:25:21 nbsp Its actually spelled wiky not wiki so...yeah, should the page be renamed? Users/MattJojola
  Where is it spelled like this?

20060504 00:33:15 nbsp no way!  There is no reason to imply that the wiki is not directly responsible for this concoction.  :) Users/AllisonEriksen

20060802 00:59:18 nbsp As someone who has never had a WWW, what is the name of the very rude bartender at Bernado, whose mixture is not the same? (so that I know who not to order from when go there) Users/AnthonyGuzzi

20060823 16:01:56 nbsp I have experienced the wonderfullness of the Wiki on many an occasion, often opting for the limit of 3 wikis.  I can safely say that this is a bad idea.  On Wiki flavoring, it depends on the bartender.  If one is looking for a Wiki of acceptable taste, go on Thursday or Saturday and talk to Adel.  On Friday nights, Tom will make you a Wiki that is exceptionally strong, but tastes of bad booze. Users/RussellAnderson

20071013 09:21:00 nbsp Really good they should make the limit 5 but the bartender on thursdays is abig nosed prick...never leave a tip
 Users/Washington

20080124 23:41:37 nbsp I used to do 2 wikis in a row at 98 lbs without getting anything more than a slight buzz. O, how I miss my tolerance. Users/ThuHo

20081014 15:01:44 nbsp oh, sweet ambrosia. . . Users/CurlyGirl26

20090521 19:48:47 nbsp Ive heard they changed the wiki recipe (less strong but more flavorful) and raised the price. Is there any truth to this desecration? Users/NickKory

20091130 19:21:15 nbsp It is possible to get more than 3, a person I may or may not know had 7 in one sitting... the individual later broke his ankle.  Not recommended. Users/DirtDiver

20091225 19:21:21 nbsp i drank 2 of these followed by many more shots later on in the night... i woke up but naked not knowing what happened, my car was scratched up, with a girl next to me and 2 dudes on the other bed... Users/betabeta

20100312 16:52:00 nbsp OK seriously, I work here and its WICKY wacky woo..not wiki. It even says it quite clearly in the picture.  Users/AJB

20100908 22:26:15 nbsp I just had my first one tonight...even a flash rainstorm+$15 of food at the Dumpling House+1 Hour in Borders couldnt sober me up! Ill never have another.   Users/ArianeMetz
