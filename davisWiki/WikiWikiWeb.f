WikiWikiWeb was the name of the wiki:Wiki:FrontPage first ever wiki site, and it was founded in 1994 as an automated supplement to the wiki:Wiki:PortlandPatternRepository Portland Pattern Repository. The site was immediately popular within the programmer community, largely due to the newness of the Internet and a good slate of wiki:Wiki:InvitedAuthors invited authors. The site was, and remains, dedicated to wiki:Wiki:PeopleProjectsAndPatterns people, projects and design patterns (Design patterns are general solutions to common problems in software design).

wiki:Wiki:WardCunningham Ward Cunningham created the site and the wiki:Wiki:WikiWikiWeb Wiki Wiki Web machinery that operates it. He chose the Hawaiian phrase wikiwiki as an alliterative substitute for quick and thereby avoided naming this stuff quickweb. An early page, wiki:Wiki:WikiWikiHyperCard WikiWiki Hyper Card, traces wiki ideas back to a wiki:Wiki:HyperCard Hyper Card stack he wrote in the late 80s.

  Its a pattern repository, which stores patterns found in pattern languages (e.g. speakable languages, computer languages, social interactions). Users/BrentLaabs bl As per http://c2.com/ppr/about/patterns.html:
  Patterns are the recurring solutions to the problems of design. People learn patterns by seeing them and recall them when need be without a lot of effort. Patterns link together in the mind so that one pattern leads to another and another until familiar problems are solved. That is, patterns form languages, not unlike natural languages, within which the human mind can assemble correct and infinitely varied statements from a small number of elements.
