Some argue that this wiki should allow for editing without the creation of an account  also known as anonymous editing.   Others argue for something even stronger: a public accounts that dont have an IP addresses publicly visible, as all wiki users IP Addresses are publicly viewable.


Empirical Studies done on the quality of anonymous wikipedia editing:
   http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/reports/abstracts/TR2007606/ Dartmouth: We find that quality is associated with contributor motivations, but in a surprisingly inconsistent way. Registered users quality increases with more contributions, consistent with the idea of participants motivated by reputation and commitment to the Wikipedia community. Surprisingly, however, we find the highest quality from the vast numbers of anonymous Good Samaritans who contribute only once. Our findings that Good Samaritans as well as committed zealots contribute high quality content to Wikipedia suggest that it is the quantity as well as the quality of contributors that positively affects the quality of open source production.
    Keep in mind that Wikipedia and the Daviswiki have different goals, abuse policies, point of view policies, and possibilities of daily real world confrontations. Plus, Wikipedia users do not typically give out their real names.  Also, theres a difference in maintaining anonymity intentionally and simply taking advantage of the ease of editing without logging in.  The report in question discusses the latter.  As a result this study does not directly apply to DavisWiki, as there are no anonymous editors that arent accountable... i.e., the study assumes a registered user with no personal information is a nonanonymous user.  By that definition, no DavisWiki editors have ever been anonymous.  Anonymity and accountability are two very different things.
          So if this study isnt comparable to us, and doesnt apply directly, why keep it on the page?  All these points above are about the differences between situations and how it isnt the same, though it may or may not be true due to those differences.  Since this page is specifically about DavisWiki/Wikispot anonymity, I dont think this section adds anything to the page, especially with what its followed with.  I vote delete. It is poor quality/poor worth empirical data (for this page). Users/EdwinS ES


The argument in favor for anonymous (nologin required) editing is that it lowers the barrier to entry, and has the potential to widen the base of editors and edits in general.  The idea behind wiki is that quality is proportional to the number of people using it and the easier it is to quickly edit the better.  Even the few moments required to create an account (or to log in from another machine) could be spent to correct a spelling issue or formatting problem.  Dedicated editors will always clean up messy crud, which can be contributed by someone even if they create an account to log in with.

Historically wikis operate in this nologin required fashion.  We have seen the creation of many onetime spam accounts, joke accounts, and accounts such as Users/DavisWikiGnome that are used just to avoid identity.  If someone is dedicated to being anonymous, they will find a way to be such regardless of whether an account is required or not.  If someone wants to spam or be messy they can do that with an account as well.  Making logins not required for editing just makes this process easier for everyone.  Goodwilled editors who wish to simply correct something without creating an account or logging in will do so quicker, mean people will make mean comments quicker, nice people will delete said mean comments faster  its all one big circle.


The argument against anonymous (nologin required) editing is that it decreases accountability and encourages individuals to avoid creating an identity  even if that identity is a pseudonym.  By creating identities we increase our accountability and recognizability on the wiki.  There is also a likelihood that more wiki spam will come about if editing is easier.  With anonymity comes a lack of accountability.

Creating an account here is also particularly easy. The lack of anonymous edits contributes to a slightly higher quality.  What weve been doing has been working rather well for us for so long, so why change?  It would be really easy for a conniving restaurant owner to tell fibs such as, I found a bandaid in my food at <competitor x>. That possibility really lowers the integrity of the information on the wiki.

In a talk recently psychologist Larry Jacoby gave an analogy thats fitting here. A factory can put out a good products by (1) having the production machinery work near perfectly so it doesnt produce defective products or (2) having lots of quality control specialists throwing out defective products before they hit the market.  What hits the stores is the same, but the burden of efficiency is displaced differently. Wiki people tend to be busy people, and Id prefer a lack of anonymity to having to clean up other peoples messes.

 Anonymous editing on the wiki 

20050502 14:52:39 nbsp Every website logs your IP.  The Wiki is open enough to level the playing field so everybody has access to that information.  Open is better.  There is no validation of user information when you signup, and the only consequence of false information is a bit less respect if you dont use your common name.  (And dammit, now my SO is calling me JabberWiki). Users/JabberWokky
   Yeah, every website logs your IP, but not every website displays it publicly. Users/ArlenAbraham

20050502 15:13:03 nbsp I see no problem with the way things are now and if you think the wiki is violating your privacy rights then you are unfamiliar with how much every website knows about you.  The wiki works off of communal trust.  There is the practical reason to allow anonymous editing:  Its quicker than logging in.  But, interestingly, it also opens up to a lot of automated spambot attacks.  For the reason that editing a page is just that much faster I would perhaps support noaccount usage.  But having anonymous accounts where the IP is not logged seems misguided.  Wikipedia and every other wiki on the planet logs anonymous IPs and displays them prominently instead of usernames.  From a practical point of view, we are all basically using a couple of IP subnets here in Davis, and if you wanted to you could easily obtain privacy by posting something from one of the many public places.  Hiding the IPs is just an illusion of privacy.  Imagine the situation in which someone posts something terribly libelous or some jerk decides to automatically delete every page in the wiki.  Then many would want me to try and crossreference that IP with some others in my logs and figure out who it is.  Logging everything and being public about everything allows me to be free from having to make that kind of call, ever. Users/PhilipNeustrom
    My concern wasnt so much about the IPs as just having an anonaccount in general (that would require login). the ip thing was just a side note. Users/ArlenAbraham

        That seems to be taking away the biggest advantage to anonymous editing:  Not having to log in?  I often edit wikipedia because I will be reading it, quickly, and will just press edit, make a correction, then press save.  If quick editing via nonaccounts is really wanted, I can turn it on.  I had discussed this pretty early on and it seemed like no one really cared and it would create the environment where nobody would make an account or log in?

20050502 15:51:05 nbsp Anonymous editing is absolutely asking for trouble. (trouble, here should be spelled SPAMMERS. having a login but publicizing it on the site wont stop them) Users/KenBloom

20050502 15:54:57 nbsp The fact that this wiki didnt open with anon edits, makes it lame. Users/KennethWaters
  The only reason for that is because practically every wiki Id seen was getting hammered by spam bots at the time we opened up.  My friends in berkeley were having a serious spam bot issue, and when they turned off anonymous editing they found the issue to drop down significantly.
    Wikipedia.org, QED  Besides, there are plenty of reasons to instate captchas.
      I agree.  Do you happen to know of a good captcha?  It seems they are http://sam.zoy.org/pwntcha/ all readily broken.
        Umm the LJ captcha is open source and has not been broken, besides if someone is going to take the time to taylor a bot to this wiki its not going to matter.  I bet I could enter captcha solutions by hand nearly as fast as the server can receive updates (although modpython has made it faster).

 IP Addresses on the wiki 
The wiki should display a hash of the users IP address + some secret data to make reversing the hash hard. (i.e. 192.168.1.1 becomes e568dcd0a1568334c309858f4145529f798fcb58) The following bit of code is great for mining the current setup (Works in bash): BR
{{{wget O  q http://www.daviswiki.org/Recent_Changes |\
tr \; \\n |\
grep rceditor|\
perl pe /<span\ class\rceditor\><span\ title\(\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+)\>(<a href\\/\w+\>)?(^<+)(<\/a>)?/;print $2 $1\n; |\
grep v class |\
egrep 09 |\
sort u}}} The above code produces the following type of output: {{{
 172.24.15.92
<a href/Bob> 192.168.80.82
<a href/Bob> 172.18.102.99
<a href/Sally> 10.192.131.6
}}} This is listing the ip addresses of edits appearing on the Recent Changes page: where 172.24.15.92 represents the ip address of an edit made by a user without a personal page; the user Bob made edits from ip addresses 192.168.80.82 and 172.18.102.99; and Sally made an edit from the ip address 10.192.131.6 BR
The problem is the wiki is keeping history of your name and IP address forever, and anyone who wanted to could get your IP from some other activity could spider daviswiki to find if anyone has made edits from that IP, and know who they are. BRBR
Yesterday I placed an image on my Wiki page that is located on my website. This has allowed me to see that at least the following people (NAT, proxies, and people sharing computers may have caused an error or two.) have visited my wiki page since then:
  Users/CarlMcCabe  Rubbish!  I never looked at anything.  Im innocent!
   Last night (09/26/05) at 8:31 pm from a Windows XP system running Mozilla 1.7.11. Or someone with the same browser and IP address as you.
    I was, um... washing dishes at 8:31.  Yes, washing dishes!  It couldnt have been me.  No way!
  Users/JasonAller
  Users/JessicaLuedtke
  Users/NickSchmalenberger
   There is no way it was me. I was at somebody elses house during the six minutes you had your offsite picture link on, I dont remember looking at the Wiki, and they have a totally different ISP from me anyway. Maybe it was somebody else at my house. Im also curious how you map an ip back to a wiki username? Have you been collecting a usernametoip map? You could use Perl or something to extract that from Recent Changes or info pages. There is still the more general problem of a wiki member being on a different IP or a nonmember, but reader, being on the same IP.Users/NickSchmalenberger
    You are on the same IP address as several other users, looks like that IP Omsofts squid proxy. I am mapping by using the above script to build an IPusername table based on recent edits, and then I can cross reference that with hits on my web server. NAT, proxies, and people sharing computers all mess up my ability to do this mapping.
     Oops. I didnt notice you put up a different link after the six minutes. I also should have read your script more carefully, sorry. What time do you have for me? Does Omsofts Squid forward the browser id? You are right that there will be problems. You say at least the following people which isnt true.Users/NickSchmalenberger

   DavisWiki does not allow external images without a border, otherwise I would have use a 1x1 transparent GIF. Instead, its a 1x1 black GIF with a 1 pixel border.

If you really wanted to, you could also find this information from lots of other websites and internet services that log IPs (IRC, etc).  If we made it into a hash then people wouldnt be able to trace IPs and do other muchiness in the face of spammers and anonymous villains (the fact its displayed isnt because its a unique identifier but because its an IP address).  Of course, when bad dudes pop up, everyone would bother me to provide them with information about the users and so forth.  Its just that releasing all the information to the users  essentially treating everyone as an administrator  protects me from a lot of police work I might feel like I have to do.  The Wiki is open enough to level the playing field so everybody has access to that information. Open is better, as Users/JabberWokky said before. Users/PhilipNeustrom

Giving people the ability to see IPs has a large potential for abuse. Some immature person could DDoS another user whos opinions they didnt agree with, or even worse, write up some fake abuse reports and get them kicked off their ISP.  If you still want IP addresses visible, then perhaps you could not show IP for changes more then a few days old, and only show them to logged in users. Users/RyanCastellucci

20050927 18:59:23 I partially agree with Ryan.  The fact that the website logs IPs should be mentioned on User Preferences, which is where you make accounts.  Something along the lines of This website logs your IP address when you edit, and displays it publicly.  This could make it possible for people to connect your computer to your real name, which most users use as their login. Users/BrentLaabs


20050927 15:34:41 nbsp one could argue that the wiki is violating our privacy rights by requiring a login and logging our IPs  I dont think this could be legitimately argued. There was no promise of anonymity that Im aware of, and daviswiki does have a privacy policy, right? Its like saying the librarys violating our privacy rights by requiring a library card. First, they need to keep track of whos got what and whos responsible if a book goes out clean and comes back destroyed; second, nobodys forcing you to go to the library. In a like manner, every sysadmin knows that logging is necessary in cases of vandalism, and second... ditto, no ones forcing you to use the wiki. Delete the page. Users/DomenicSantangelo
   20050927 15:39:53 nbsp There is nothing informing you when you sign up that your IP address will be made publicly visible. I didnt know about it until about a month ago, and there is nothing I can do about old edits that have my IP logged. Users/RyanCastellucci

It should be noted that IP address hiding/masking has been requested and rejected on the http://bugzilla.wikipedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id556 MediaWiki bugtracker:

Closing as WONTFIX because:

_ there is clause to no way to figure out the identity of someone given his ip address.

  DavisWiki PROVIDES a way to figure out the identity of someone given their ip address, since users are asked to use their RealNames

_ people can use an anonymizing service or create an account
  This bug report is for MediaWiki, used by Wikipedia, but not DavisWiki. Wikipedia does not show IP addresses of logged in users, DavisWiki does, and does not inform people of this when they sign up and make edits.
    Any admin on Wikipedia can see a users IP address.  There are hundreds and hundreds of site admins, and practically any highly active user of Wikipedia is granted admin status.  On Davis Wiki, everyone has said admin abilities (deleting images, seeing IPs, etc).  Perhaps just making IPs visible when logged in would be okay?
      This would be a good, in addition to that, I would like to see IP addresses be removed from the edit logs after a couple of days (If someone is being abusive, it will generally be found out pretty quick) Users/RyanCastellucci

20050928 09:15:14 nbsp Giving people the ability to see IPs has a large potential for abuse. Some immature person could DDoS another user whos opinions they didnt agree with, or even worse, write up some fake abuse reports and get them kicked off their ISP. Alarmist much? DDoS attacks against a single IP address should almost instantly get filtered at the ISP level, and if they dont  good, you just made your ISP aware that they need to be a little more vigilant about DDoS attacks. As far as the fake abuse report goes, puhhhleeeeeeez. You dont think the users ISP is going to check their logs to verify the abuse report? I DO think users should be aware that their IPs are being logged and are publicly visible, but honestly, if youre that paranoid about privacy you probably shouldnt be on the internet in the first place.  Users/DomenicSantangelo
  ISPs __do not__ log all internet traffic (it is not legally required, and is too expensive for the little if any benefits of doing it.) There is no way for them to verify most types of abuse reports. Also, DDoS attacks are very hard to filter, especially since the source IPs of a DDoS can be spoofed. Users/RyanCastellucci
    I think you may have misunderstood what I meant by check their logs. Most ISPs (at least the one I worked for and the ISPs we worked with on abuse reports) do in fact keep a log of when each user logged on/logged off, their assigned IP address, and the MAC address of the nic they connected with. So $ISP gets a faked abuse report for $IP_ADDRESS, checks the logs, and sees that $IP_ADDRESS logged off hours before the supposed abuse took place, or that $IP_ADDRESS was idle at the time (in the case of alwayson connections). In the case of an unverifiable abuse report, threat to the legitimate user is minimal. Youre just spreading FUD. As far as DDoS attacks go, theyre not that tough to filter as long as your hardware is set up correctly. At an ISP, I would hope this is the case. Your ICMP and SYN packet rates should be limited at minimum, and ideally youd have a hardware solution such as the http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps5888/ Cisco Guard. I find it interesting that you chose IP spoofing as the critical reason DDoS attacks can be difficult to defeat, since the strength of the DDoS attack is its distributed nature. More FUD! Users/DomenicSantangelo
     Say I syn flood you with random source addresses with a source TCP port of 80. Your ISP rate limits syn packets to you. Sweet.... But you cant hit web servers because the rate limiting ALSO filters those packets. Even if TCP and UDP flooding dont work, there are plenty of other ways to knock people offline by spamming their IP with garbage. Users with PPPoE dynamic addresses can just reconnect to get around this, but if you have static IPs or a cable modem (cable modems typically have long lease times, so you would have to leave the cable modem unplugged for quite a while.) Ive never worked with DDoS mitigation hardware, so I dont know how well that works, but Ive seen people on big ISPs get packeted offline more then once (such are the joys of IRC) Users/RyanCastellucci
      I dont know what to tell you, other than its a ridiculous conversation to have on the wiki. There are http://staff.washington.edu/dittrich/misc/ddos/ plenty of http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/newsflash.html resources available to help http://www10.org/cdrom/papers/409/ defeat DDoS attacks. Bottom line: youre being alarmist. Relax, its just the internet. If I got DDoSd you know what Id do? Take a walk. Smoke a pipe. Play a video game. Spend time with friends. Knowing that the 5cr12p7 k1dd13 who started the attack will get bored and leave me alone. Users/DomenicSantangelo
    Just to back up Domenic, ISPs do log connections, and thus can match an IP to an account and almost always to the specific phone line/DSL line/ISDN line/cable line/tin can that the user connected from.  Ive worked with law enforcement doing exactly that several times.  Users/JabberWokky
     Yes, I work at an ISP. Im well aware that when you log on/off is logged, as well as idleness, but what you are doing with your connection usually is not logged, which is what I was referring to. Users/RyanCastellucci
      The thing is, its not what anyone else was referring to. We were referring to the fact that ISPs can, in fact, check logs to verify an abuse report, in direct contradiction to your assertion: There is no way for them to verify most types of abuse reports. You claimed by inference that all traffic would need to be logged in order for an abuse report to be verified. This is simply not so, as Users/JabberWokky explained with experience. Users/DomenicSantangelo
       My point is entirely valid. You made an edit to the Wiki. I have your IP address and time that you were online. If I forge some logs of you trying to crack my box, your ISP probably wont be able to tell that the logs are forged.
        Haha, I dont know what to tell you, man. Even the ISP I worked for (and we were a small outfit) wasnt that gullible. Give it up. Your concern is noted. Nobody cares. Users/DomenicSantangelo

For those who care deeply about their anonymity Id recommend using the http://tor.eff.org/ Tor network.  This seems like a nice compromise to wanting anonymous editing.  Create a new account while using the Tor network, then you can edit the pages and it will log Tors exit proxy IPs instead of yours.  Its what I do.  This would deter spam bots but allow people to make edits.  Anonymous proxies and the Java Anonymous Proxy also work.  Users/OnceLivedInDavis 20050930 01:00:55

20051004 16:36:46 nbsp I thought Id clarify my position on this... I am far more worried about data mining the wiki to find out who was using an IP at a specific time then I am worried about script kiddies. Users/RyanCastellucci
  I agree thats the most obvious way to exploit the information.  If theres an agreement here then we can make the IPs visible only to those in an Admin Group.  It does add some liability to the runningthesite end of things, but I think its an acceptable compromise to have more online privacy.  However, it does remove information from the hands of the majority of wiki users.  The argument, I suppose, is that its not really information wiki users want to have except in the cases of widespread vandalism and so forth.

20051011 17:49:45 nbspIm on Ryans side now. This alone should be reason enough: go check udavislife.com.  They pulled Carls name and are trying to randomly trash talk. Carl mentioned it on their wiki page.  Unnecessary.   I agree that ip addresses either shouldnt be viewed.  And not just when youre not loggin in, cause anyone can quickly make an account.  It imo should be a reserved privilege that you get when you reach 500, 750, 1000, something like that edits.  Besides, someone with 10 or 15 edits wouldnt even really (probably) know enough to know how to deal with some sort of troublemaker anyway.  Everyone who knows how/would do it usually/ or is active enough to catch and ban or whatever some type of attack or troublemaker is over 250 edits as a base minimum regardless.  Users/EdWins ES

   ... the admin responded first by deleting my posts and then by tracking the anonymous posts through the IP address and picking my user name off the wiki. Users/CarlMcCabe Users/RyanCastellucci wonders if they used the shell script he posted here to do that.
