My Crystal CRT tells me that there will be another Wiki BBQ in the year 2009 and the month of October and the date of 25 which happens to be a Sun Day. The gathering will commence three hours after the sun peaks and conclude after the Sun returns to the Earth. Or there abouts. It will be held in the usual slide hill park secret location. It will be a Pot Luck. No gold is required for presence (but edibles are encouraged).

My glowing portal shows:

  Wizards in strange attire
  XSlaughtered Meat Lab animal guts on a sacrificial fireX
  Bottles of liquids
  Potions to beer quaff
  Bags and bowls of vegetable matter
  XSacrificial fires with glowing coals and belching smokeX

 Report from the BBQ 

The glowing portal was not particularly accurate. There were potions quaffed, but not enough people attended to make it worth starting a sacrificial fire. There was pumpkin custard (vegetable matter), and grapes & potato curry were eaten. Otherwise, mostly a bust. Users/DougWalter

Seven people showed up in total. One person, named Shawn, came by and passed out advertisements to everyone (it was for a  competitive website), took a beer and immediately left. Redux of steal a hotdog incident. Critical mass wasnt achieved to warrant starting a fire. Anyone need a bag of briquettes (and a lot of food)? Some (presumably UCD students) were playing on the grass nearby. When they heard we were DavisWiki enthusiasts, several of them highly praised the Wiki and told anecdotes of how they used it all the time (including that morning). A woman walked her dog past and even knew about the Wiki BBQ. Seems everyone (The Davis Enterprise almost) knows and loves our Wiki. While turnout was much less than I expected, there was beautiful weather, plenty of good food, and good people (quality, not quantity). Users/SteveDavison

   I think youve confused the dates. The film fest is Saturday, the BBQ is Sunday.

20091026 06:52:25 nbsp Perhaps not needing a decoder card to figure out when it was actually happening would have been nice :)  Or scheduling it just before midterms might have been a barrier. Users/RyanMikulovsky
