20100409 08:39:01 nbsp I do not think I have anything important that day or anything big due in the next week. Should I bring stuff to make root beer floats or an entree type item?  Users/hankim

20100409 09:05:59 nbsp I could be there on the 18th, the 25th could work as well.  We should do it at Slide hill park. Users/DagonJones

20100409 09:08:54 nbsp Slide Hill and either date works for me. Users/WilliamLewis

20100409 09:54:34 nbsp Root Beer Floats!!!  4/18 works better for me... my son has his black belt test Fri, Sat and Sun so hell be hungry  and ready for a BBQ.  If we can make it, Ill bring kalbi beef short ribs. Users/Aaron.Curtin

20100409 14:07:41 nbsp Sounds like 4/18 is probably the way to go, and yeah, definitely at slide hill park! Users/TomGarberson

20100409 20:10:58 nbsp I can make it on 4/18, not after. Users/PaulAmnuaypayoat

20100409 21:05:38 nbsp Yes, I have a chance on 4/18 and not the next weekend. I ... will figure out what BBQ item I can schlep to Slide Hill when the event is even closer. :{{{^}}}) Users/DougWalter
  phooey: my mistake, Ive made a commitment for that time. Have fun, and everyone remember to bring your own reusable plates, cups, & utensils :) Users/DougWalter

20100410 00:35:19 nbsp 18th sounds good Users/StevenDaubert

20100413 14:42:08 nbsp Ok so are we on for Apr. 18th?  what time works good?  I will likely get there between 24pm.  Users/DagonJones

20100413 21:37:19 nbsp Oh, by the way I will have some LIVE abalone from a dive I will do on Saturday.  Abalone is not good for a bbq but if someone is a really big fan of abalone I will listen. Users/DagonJones

   Abalone!!!  If you dont mind, Id love some. Havent had fresh in ages. I have a great seasoned breaded recipe I want to try out.
   Wow!  If you have extra, Id love one!  Ive only had it once before and it was incredible.  Time to do some recipe hunting... Users/TomGarberson

20100414 01:45:38 nbsp Im pulling an allniter as a bouncer on Friday and Saturday, but if Im energetic enough to attend I will be there... cant promise 2pm though. Users/WesOne

20100414 10:27:03 nbsp Ill be there Users/OliviaY

20100416 21:11:41 nbsp Ive been referring to this weekend as the best weekend ever... first picnic day in 7 years when I a) havent had my parents here (not that I dont love my parents!); and b) havent been stuck doing moot court stuff all day, PLUS my first wiki gathering!  Damn excited! Users/TomGarberson

20100418 11:01:38 nbsp So it turns out I have an IM ultimate game at 4.  Hopefully people will be hanging out for a while, since Ill have to run for an hour and a half or so. Users/TomGarberson
