Following the success of the Wiki BBQ June 2005 first BBQ in June, it was unanimously agreed upon to have another Wiki Gatherings Gathering.  The second BBQ was also held at Slide Hill Park on the 19th of August, and was followed by a game of Sardines in the Death Star.

20050821 16:30:52 nbsp could we do it on a sunday instead of a friday? i have a feeling lots of people dont show up b/c fridays a busy night. Users/CraigBrozinsky

20050821 16:35:45 nbsp Someone said something about doing a backtoschool gathering. That would probably work for everyone. And Craig I believe, said we should have a wiki scavenger hunt to get photo requests filled. Good idea everyone Users/MichelleAccurso

Very nice gathering.  We need to do these far more often. Users/BrentLaabs

20050821 19:02:28 nbsp so whens the next bbq? there we can personally advocate the entry for man tits. Users/ApolloStumpy

20050822 08:08:09 nbsp Yeah, it was roughly 1/2 the attendance of the 1st one, although the most recent one was only advertised through the Wiki Grathering page, and only made it to the events page at the last minute.  So basically, people like me who look at recent changes constantly attended. Users/JaimeRaba

20050822 14:31:31 nbsp I heard about it from targuy Users/MarieHuynh
