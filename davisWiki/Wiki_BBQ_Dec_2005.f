This Wiki Gatherings BBQ was held at Slide Hill Park on Sunday the 11th at 3:00PM8:00PM.

People who came: (Add yourselves!)
  Users/AndrewBanta who drank all the booze
  Users/DavidHopper the new guy who stayed until he was cold and thirsty
  Users/JaimeRaba was not actually there, the BBQ ran itself, and the meat and booze just magically appeared out of nowhere. It was truly magical.
  Users/JessicaLuedtke and Leif
  Users/JohnDudek Who did not bring any BBQ Microwave Popcorn.
  Users/MarieHuynh Whose wit and charm was wonderful to have.
  Users/MichelleAccurso who has a perfect _ (it looks like Paul Amnuaypayoat his nose).
  Paul Amnuaypayoat with the cool last name nobody can pronounce
  Users/RevChad pokes, end of sentence.
  Users/SteveDavison and his amazing beard
  Users/TarZxf didnt burp like a bear
  No police

For the first hour we watched two http://flickr.com/photos/19817416@N00/sets/1599367/ halfnaked guys in hard hats (think wiki:WikiPedia:Tom_of_finland Tom of Finland) smear mayonaise on each other. Film at eleven.

After they left we fired up the first of our grills, and ate eight hotdogs. We thought only Users/SteveDavison brought food, but then Users/JaimeRaba brought his own grill, chicken, and salmon so the party relocated under a light. Later, Graham crackers, marshmallows, and chocolate arrived and people experimented with the art of making smores.

There was plenty of beer and liquor, however almost none (1 can) was consumed.
  What do you mean??? I drank pleanty of booze! Users/AndrewBanta
    My error. Change to read Andrew drank ALL the booze. ;)

It was a little cold, but clear and nice weather especially for midDecember.

Pictures!
