There was a Wiki Gatherings Wiki BBQ on January 17, 2009 at Slide Hill Park.


Who came:

  Users/JessicaLuedtke and family are, as usual, bringing cookies.
  Users/NickSchmalenberger will bring some pasta salad or cheeseburger pie, as well as WilliamLewis.
  Users/JasonAller will bring Wiki Button Wiki Buttons
  Users/AlexMandel, Users/MicheleTobias, Users/RyanMikulovsky and Users/StaceyEllis will bring some sort of snack food, to be determined...



Nobody in the larger nonrecentchangeshawk community is gonna come to this!  You needed to have made this page, posted it around, etc for at least a week prior.  That might not be a problem, but Im just saying. Users/PhilipNeustrom
  Maybe thats a good thing because there might not be enough wiki buttons to go around.  ...wouldnt want to start a button riot, you know.

20090117 14:10:04 nbsp I completely agree with Philip, it was random that I saw the word BBQ in chat and started poking around to figure out what was going on and didnt know for sure until about noon. If we really want to do these, put the date down, make a page and advertise, otherwise its more like a gnome party and we missed quite a few of those too. Users/AlexMandel

20090117 14:40:56 nbsp We are here and talking about why you are not. Users/JasonAller

20090117 14:46:27 nbsp wiki bbq?

Damn! Users/StevenDaubert

20090117 15:12:30 nbsp I told you guys to do it next week.  Ill be there next week if anyone wants to do some sort of gathering then. Users/BrentLaabs

20090117 15:46:36 nbsp Id be down for next week!  Unfortunately, I had something today. Users/CurlyGirl26

20090117 16:05:55 nbsp Oh, hell... Had I but known. ;)  Philip is right though  it should have hit the Featured Page awhile back.  Somebody go update the Featured Page entry to something either I Love Davis listed here, or some obscure group you know and love and think others might like.  Honestly, its a great visible spot for events and groups, but its seldom updated.  Use it! (And keep in mind it can always be Featured Pages, so long as it doesnt fill up the front page)  Users/JabberWokky

20090117 16:58:58 nbsp Re: the photo: Why is Nick using the power of his mind to levitate the dog in the foreground?   Users/JabberWokky

20090117 18:02:42 nbsp This was a bad situation either way. Yes, it should have been publicized more, but the date and time have been posted for a while, and I thought it better to go ahead and try to get some people there and not risk having some random person show up to the announced party and find no one else there.

In any case, the weather was as perfect as were likely to get for a while, and I dont think anyone who attended regretted it! Users/JessicaLuedtke

20090117 18:52:32 nbsp Well do another one in Feb since I wasnt able to make it to this one either... Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20100318 12:13:57 nbsp Will there be another BBQ coming up in 2010?? Users/DagonJones
  Theres Wiki Gatherings talk of April 4. Users/TomGarberson Edit: but it turns out thats Easter, so I imagine turnout would be low.
