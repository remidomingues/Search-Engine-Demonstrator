 People who wish they could come 
  Users/NicholasBarry  Man, I wish I could come! But Im tabling for Davis Dollars all day at the Whole Earth Festival. Next time around...
  Users/BruceHansen  I may make it to the Whole Earth Festival and might not make it out of there.  Im apprehensive of seeing formerly just virtual people.  I was thinking of bringing skewers and vegies for shish kabob. (Lacto vegetarian)
  Users/SarahEdwards  At a bridal event.  Doh!
  Users/ChristyMarsden  Class field trip all day ... I was totally planning on coming too!
  Users/JoePomidor  I was actually considering going after coming under considerable pressure by a Users/OliviaY friend, but unfortunately I have a Davis Paintball Center longstanding preexisting commitment.
  Users/OliviaY  More likely than not I will have to miss the BBQ (Sad I know but its for a potentially awesome reason.  Well see...Im a maybe for now)
  Users/MattHh  If I werent on the other side of the country ;) I would so be there. Cant believe I never went to one of these when I lived in Davis.
  users/deeray82  Im so sorry all, I was all gungho about coming, but now Im just not feeling sociable, and that wouldnt go well at all with meeting a whole bunch of new people...

 aftermath 
It was great success
Folks were met in person, discussion was abound AGTV showed up and took some interviews
Habanero Jack was well received! Hot Dogs, Sausages, burgers, salads!
The highlights were Those are on the wiki?! in response to me complementing TG on his beer photos
and Cover Professor made a cameo!
Also during the bbq a HUGE 68{{{}}} branch fell from a tree that was roughly 70 yards away! When it hit the ground an owl flew out! Nuts!

I actually enjoyed meeting the folks that I have had some rather hostile interactions with!!! They all behaved (SURPRISE!!) rather docile and polite in person..... users/JoshLawson
 Definitely good to meet you. tg

It was a good BBQ, saw a lot of editors I knew and met some new ones. Enjoyed chatting with CovertProfessor. We need to not wait so long for the next one. Users/JasonAller

Great meeting editors in person for the first time: Users/TomGarberson, Users/JabberWokky,  Users/DagonJones, users/JoshLawson, Users/CovertProfessor.  Hope to see you all again soon!  Users/JonathanLawton

I was especially impressed by CovertProfessors hand stands!  I was glad to be in a select non covert group.  It was great to meet you others that were still there! Users/BruceHansen

It was well worth the long drive to meet all you people.  I really should try to make it out to Davis more often.  Users/MikeIvanov

Sad I missed the fun guys but if you watch season Five of the guild youll see what I was up to instead. I have one more scene to fill in on before heading home from LA!  no lines but lots of fun being background and occasional foreground! Plus I met SO many scifi people doing cameos!!!OY

I hate to have missed this, but the Whole Earth Festival date choice could barely have been Picnic Day worse; Im surprised anyone showed up. Users/SteveDavison
