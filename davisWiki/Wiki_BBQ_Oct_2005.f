This Wiki Gatherings BBQ was held at Slide Hill Park on Thursday the 27th at 3:00PM9:00PM. This BBQ was special as it celebrated Wiki History 1 year of the Wiki. There was cake and beer and good times. (Anyone ever figure out how to make the microwave popcorn?)

  Davis Police Department  Or at least two cars.  One with headlights on.  One with headlights off.  They didnt say anything.  I think they may have been looking for Osama.  Or maybe they heard someone was going to BBQ microwave popcorn.

20051028 16:12:57 nbsp I like the unicycle pic.  And I really had fun last night.  Leifs hat was rocksome. Users/JaimeRaba

20051029 16:34:08 nbsp A month is a long time. Is there any interest in having microgatherings, say a weekly lunch at a downtown restaurant? Pref. a different place each time we could review it. Users/SteveDavison

20051029 22:30:22 nbsp Jaime suggested to me that I host my show during the a wiki BBQ, which would certainly be fun, but would have to be planned out months in advance, and we would probably need a nearby internet connection to make it happen (wireless works). That is, if it is hosted on a thursday, it would be live.  I do have remote recording capeabilities now, ready to go at a moments notice, but hey, what about a live discussion amongst wikians and some wikivangelism. Users/KarlMogel
