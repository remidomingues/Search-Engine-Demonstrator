20070626 09:12:47 nbsp Sad Sad Sad, I will not be in town.. yet again. Users/DavidPoole

20070626 18:16:23 nbsp Thats 777   shouldnt we be off gambling? Users/JaimeRaba
 Some poker chips, a few card tables. Cards. Mahjong? Who says we cant? Users/KevinChin

20070626 18:40:14 nbsp questions: is this open to anyone on the daviswiki? are there any games or activities planned? For example, could we arrange the catapult?
ok, zaijian. Users/JessicaRockwell

 Absolutely anyone who wants to can come. Arrange any activities you would like!

20070627 02:15:55 nbsp we need supplies for wiki capture the flag Users/StevenDaubert
  maybe a capture the sockpuppet and troll game?

20070627 05:02:12 nbsp possible drinking game: everytime someone says wiki or davis, take a drink. (if you do this to the word evidence while watching richard dawkins http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0774118/ the root of all evil?, you get plastered very quickly).  Users/JessicaRockwell

20070627 13:44:30 nbsp lame name now, phillip fails Users/StevenDaubert It needs to go back to omgwtfROFLwikBBQ after the event is said and done...

20070627 14:28:57 nbsp If there is alcohol  shouldnt an open container permit be secured just to be sure that when things get wild everything will be OK? Users/SharlaDaly
  20070627 14:40:55 nbsp Yeah, Sharla, I was thinking of doing that. Users/BrentLaabs
   20070627 16:42:34 nbsp thats taking it a step above, all you have to do is talk with the officer of that specific sector during the time the wikiQ is going down, slide hill is an open container park, and I expect the wikizens can keep it civil... Users/StevenDaubert
    Has the city council banned alcohol everywhere?  I remember hearing that they were thinking about it.  I was of the understanding the Slide Hill was one of the parks excepted under the open container ordinance.  (Can you update the Open Container page if so?)  The citys http://www.city.davis.ca.us/cmo/oco.cfm open container info page hasnt been updated, at least.  If its not required I think it is a good idea that we explicitly do not get a permit.  I think that responsible drinking should be allowed by adults in our parks without explicit approval of the city, and so we ought to set a good example!  Users/PhilipNeustrom
     Nicely put Phillip, mirrors my sentiments exactly. At the MOST we should touch base with the officers of the sector....  Users/StevenDaubert
     So from my understanding based on this http://www.cityofdavis.org/cmo/citycode/detail.cfm?p26&q2378 link, its ok to drink alcohol in parks and greenbelts. It shall be unlawful for any person to consume any alcoholic beverage......in other areas commonly held open to the public use, except: Any public park and greenbelt, except for....parks within six hundred feet of any primary or secondary school campus property lines at any time as specified above; Also, if we are going to submit an application for a permit and were planning for there to be over eleven (11) people at this event, wed have to submit the application sixteen (16) business days before the event to the dpd. a notice of the application would then be sent to everyone that lives within 200 feet of the bbq. http://www.cityofdavis.org/cmo/citycode/detail.cfm?p26&q2380 link 2. Users/JessicaRockwell
    I just talked with dispatch, trying to figure out what officer will be running the sector slide hill is in on the 7th during the day, I was given transfer to the sergeant who is in charge of permits... who is out of town until the 8th.... Golden Users/StevenDaubert
    Steven, is the park within 600 feet of a primary or secondary school? if not, i dont think we need a permit as ddrinking alcohol is allowed in parks as i said above. theres also the link.  Users/JessicaRockwell
     No school that I know is that close.  Korematsu looks closest at 1/3 mile.  Heres the citys http://www.ci.davis.ca.us/cmo/pdfs/Schools600Buf.pdf buffer map  Users/EdHenn
    Thats what I said Jessica, we should just let the officer in charge of the sector know whats going on, that way if someone does call it it he already know what hes getting into, a bunch of friendly people BBQing... I dont see it being an issue, but this way its covered... twice, and redundancy kicks ass. I never said anything about me trying to get a permit...  Users/StevenDaubert

20070629 23:40:35 nbsp Is anyone other than Jaime bringing a BBQ?  We might want one thats better than the ones in the park. Users/BrentLaabs

20070630 03:05:22 nbsp omg omg omg omg i am so excited, mostly about jaime cooking. JAIME! ill bring whatever, you always cook and bring so much food, ill gladly buy some stuff. holy crap i adore you all. SEE YOU THERE!!! Users/MichelleAccurso

20070701 23:56:30 nbsp Which bus line drops you off by the park? Users/GregSiu
   I think its the P/Q line.

Does anyone else think 3 is too early? itll be really hot. also, food is going to be needed. so if ppl come from 3 on, the dispersal of the food seems like it may be lopsided with lots of variety for ppl at the end, and the early ppl not getting much options. never been, so i dont know. just throwing this out there. additionally, some ppl wanted to have a showing of teknolust. i doubt there are outlets for a projector. can you even show rated R movies in a park? Users/JessicaRockwell

    Does someone have a projector?
       possibly domies or mark chang.
  3pm didnt seem too early when it wasnt going to be 110Â° out. Thought Id mention also that the https://rec.ci.davis.ca.us/vsiwebtrac.html park/class reservation site (log in as guest) shows a Partial reservation for Slide Hill at 4pm. If its the area http://www.cityofdavis.org/pcs/facility/details.cfm?id95B32B2ACB8E48ED925E834AE66BCC18&typePicnic%20Area pictured then its likely the part of the park near Manor Pool, on the dolphin side. Users/KevinChin

20070705 16:38:53 nbsp Could those in charge of the Wiki Shirts bring a bunch of them so that those who have been clamoring for them can get one? or two? Sizes M and S? or http://daviswiki.org/Sex#headc0bf3ecf91186def78018c89e9b51b40d5cdb585 viceversa, if youre into that kind of thing? Users/KevinChin
  see, if people dont check Recent Changes, then that kind of haphazard linking will just get a guy into trouble.
 I have wiki:sacramento SacWiki shirts if anyone is interested. Users/CharlesMcLaughlin

20070706 19:47:28 nbsp I went there today at around 4:30 PM thinking it was today and nobody was there.  I was really disappointed but then I realized I was a day early. :O Users/EfremRensi
  Hey I beat you by six days, showed up last Saturday.  Awesome.  Users/EdHenn

20070707 02:45:29 nbsp anybody going up from the bay area? Users/MarieHuynh
    You?  Users/StevenDaubert

20070707 11:46:13 nbsp Okay, Im definitely bringing an assortment of hotdogs and buns, and perhaps some other goodies.  I also have a lot of hamburger buns, but no hamburger.  So if anyone wants to brings some, post here.
 Users/JaimeRaba

20070707 12:32:47 nbsp Im new and dont know how this whole thing works, but is someone bringing cups, plates, silverware, napkins ect or do we bring our own? Users/SummerVisitor
   In the past, no one has brought anything, and we all simultaneously realize we havent brought anything, and someone runs off to the store to get those and anything else that has been forgotten. This happens every time, and is pretty much a tradition. Bringing your own is always a safe bet. Users/JessicaLuedtke jl
    So. . . if we do bring cutlery well be heralded as messiahs? or will we just be labeled as n00bs and castigated by our peers? Why do I feel its going to be the latter? Users/KevinChin kc
      Oh fine, Ill reply so you can stop hitting reload every 10 seconds waiting for a response :) We would never ostracize someone for having the half a brain that the rest of us dont have. If you bring microwave popcorn, on the other hand.... Users/JessicaLuedtke jl

20070707 17:02:37 nbsp In ur park droppin burgrs in ur bbq Users/TarZxf

20070707 20:35:14 nbsp Um, the party is still going... Were looking at the pics already! Users/TarZxf

20070708 13:35:27 nbsp I move that is page go back to its casual name of OMGWTFROFLMAOWIKIBBQ as it is now a past event... Users/StevenDaubert

20070708 19:57:00 nbsp Yeah, I will totally add some photos like now, once I edit them and all. Seriously, this comment will help me push myself to do it. I also have great videos of the XdeathX slide and the spinning toy Xof doomX!  Users/MichelleAccurso

20070708 22:16:57 nbsp Thanks everyone from Users/LillianChow Lil and I; we had an awesome time (if not a bit distracted by the birthday party across the way). The pic of Ed on the doomslide (our name for it) is classic. I hope he was able to safely extract the woodchips from his person. Little z and I discovered a distinct difference in speed between this one and the one at Community Park our first time here. . . enough that Id never again try it on cardboard. Brave folks :) . Users/KevinChin

20070711 01:10:51 nbsp Next time, Ill go back to my old ways of BBQing massive amounts of fish and chicken, but this time I was sattled with way too many hotdogs left over from July 4, thus the zillion hotdogs.  Whens a good time for the next one?  Late Sept for backtoschoolaque?  OMGLOLROFLBBQF07? Users/JaimeRaba

20071106 22:27:01 nbsp This BBQ was one of the best. So this is the obligatory, nostalgic, weneedtohaveanotherone comment...

We need to have another one! Users/MichelleAccurso
    indeed. i totally agree. OMGWTFWIKIBBQ Version 3.0. So, when shall it be?!!? Maybe the Saturday before finals? December 1?
      I think that the plan is to hold a fund raiser at the beginning of December. Users/JasonAller
