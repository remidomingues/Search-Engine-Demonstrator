Wiki Buttons similar to Wiki Sticker wiki stickers, but wearable. Sort of like Wiki shirts, but you can attach them to your backpack and wear them everyday. Available as accessories for Wikivangelists and Wiki Gnome gnomes.

  Im handing them out on a first come first serve basis. If you run into me in person before I run out of them you can have one. Users/JasonAller

20090117 17:46:22 nbsp Do you have lots of them or just a few?  If you have lots, maybe they could be placed at distribution points around the city so that more people can get one. Users/IDoNotExist
  I didnt order enough for that, but Ill gladly share the file I used to generate them and the name of the business that I ordered them from. They were made by Buttons n Bears, Oh My! (916) 8716708, a Davis local company. They should still have the design on file and offer volume discounts for larger orders. If you want to order enough to set up distribution points, by all means, go ahead. Users/JasonAller

20090117 19:26:52 nbsp Can we wrap them in plastic squares, and then sell them in condom machines?  That would totally get a lot of microdonations for the wiki. Users/BrentLaabs
