Is the wiki nearly complete?  At some point, if people keep adding to the wiki, every topic related to Davis will be covered, and there will be no more to add, with the exception of the occasional addition or change.  Its likely that it can never actually be complete, unless nothing ever changes in Davis.  But based on the current rate of new page creation (just by observing recent changes  only a few hundred pages have been created in the past several months, not from hard data), it appears that very little is currently being added to the wiki.  That suggests that either there is very little left to add (the wiki is approaching the limit of completeness), or there is a loss of interest among wiki users in editing the wiki.

Thoughts?


Weve all been busy with the election!  (At least I have!)  Users/PhilipNeustrom
  Yup, busy with the election.  Its finally over, though.  Users/BrentLaabs

  Really?  Was the voting on anything important?  Who won?  ;)  Users/IDoNotExist

20081109 14:56:19 nbsp Is there only a small core of people who create pages?  If so, that may not be healthy for the wiki over the long term.  If that core loses interest and is not replaced, the wiki will cease to reflect the current state of Davis. It seems to me that having a very large pool of active wiki editors is essential for long term wikihealth... Users/IDoNotExist

20081109 17:45:54 nbsp Allow me to introduce you to Wanted Pages. Let me know when that list is empty. Users/JasonAller

20081110 12:05:36 nbsp Jason Aller wins on this page, for sure Users/StevenDaubert

20081110 13:51:36 nbsp I know Ive been busy with school so it could be that people are just busy right now.  I think we tend to go through cycles where people are not as active and other times where people are more prolific.  I think its normal and not something to be too concerned over.  I think its up to us to spread the gospel of the Wiki, though to get more involvement from the community. Users/CurlyGirl26
  Yeah, wait until finals week procrastination editing rally.  Users/BrentLaabs

20100526 17:26:40 nbsp To put it bluntly, we need more babies.  More babies means more things to document, and more things to document means a brighter future for us all.  Do your duty.  Make more babies. Users/ScottMeehleib
  We should also keep in mind the Seed/Definition babies who end up in the Orphaned Pages orphanage. Users/EBT

20100527 17:42:33 nbsp As KemblePope wrote on my page, what would be really great is a full length bio (w/pic) of every City Council member in the history of Davis... and lengthy descriptions of every City Commission, with some info on action that theyve taken.  Not to mention doing a better job documenting the current City Council election... Users/CovertProfessor
   I did all the mayors with as much info as I could, which in most cases was just their name and service dates, crosslinked to the years.  Scaffolding that I was hoping would be better fleshed out by now.  Same with the police chiefs (the original of whom was the only cop in town, riding around on a Harley!).  There is a metric skyload of stuff left to do.  It is laughable to say that it is anywhere near complete.  Let me know when an arbitrary address lists the history of that lot from annex to construction to demo, to new home to list of owners to today. jw
