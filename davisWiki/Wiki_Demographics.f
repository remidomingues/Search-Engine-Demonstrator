tableofcontents(right)It seems somewhat unwikilike to ask people to document their demographic info, but some of this info is readily apparent by interpreting ones wiki use.  What follows is a descriptive breakdown of the Wikis most frequent contributors.
Data
Gender


This analysis was restricted to the 144 users who have made 50 or more changes to the Wiki as of 103105. Gender was gauged by peoples user names, pictures, or their use of pronouns to describe themselves. This information was not available for fewer than 5% of the sample, so strong inferences guided how these individuals were coded.

Overall, 39% of Wiki contributors were female, 61% male. The results get more interesting when you break it down by number of contributions. The top 10% of contributors (n14) are 85% male. If you break the analysis into quarters, the: BR

see also Wiki Community/Women



Age, Generation, etc.
There are demographics here too.
Ethnicity, Culture and Nationality
I dont think there is any issue with ethnicity on the wiki, but we do support quite a few pages reflecting the ethnic sub communities of davis.
Social Class
Some people dont have computers, some people are rich, some poor, some students, some professors.

Student Status


Heres a gender by studentstatus breakdown for the top 25% of contributors (n36) to the wiki. Undergrad status was assesed as of Fall Quarter 2005. An informal analysis of the top 25% reveals there to be 20 undergrads, 7 grad students, 5 nonstudent Davisites, and 4 people who neither live in Davis nor are currently affiliated with the University. It is unclear whether these numbers generalize beyond the top 25% of contributors.


Another example of wiki introspection is Interpreting User Statistics.

Analysis
Stuff here to take an introspective,  a priori look at the data from above.
Is the community accessible?
Is the community fair?
What can be done to promote the community?


What about %undergrad, etc  Users/ArlenAbraham arlen

20051031 22:14:38 nbsp I want to see more data about nonstudent townies. Users/KenjiYamada

20051031 22:16:22 nbsp If anyone wants my excel worksheet, email me. my email address is cjbroz@uc ... Users/CraigBrozinsky

20051031 22:24:32 nbsp I love the wiki but its as diverse as an apple pie vs. an apple pie vs. a dutch apple pie Users/JesseSingh
  Mmmmm... Pie!   Users/TarZxf

20051101 02:59:55 nbsp Looks pretty good.  The male/female ratio could be more balanced, but Im amazed that nonstudents contribute so much.  Bravo. Users/JaimeRaba

20051101 15:47:30 nbsp what about those wikiers who arent UC affliated? (go walruses!) Users/MichelleAccurso

20051101 15:50:33 nbsp Who are Walruses? Users/JaimeRaba
  When I started school at Solano Community College my friends from high school and I decided that since it was community college we were going to make our own mascot. We were the UNS (University Near http://www.scandiafamilycenter.com/ Scandia) Walruses! Because walruses are simply awesome. Users/MichelleAccurso

20051101 16:04:19 nbsp if anyone wants to take the time to code users in terms of student status, townie status, age, sex, etc., id be happy to do a statistical analysis based on the results. i might not be able to carry out the analysis for a couple of weeks though. Users/CraigBrozinsky

20051101 16:10:44 nbsp I just want to point out that the chart displayed above only reflects whether individuals are undergrads, not whether or not they are students. I believe there are a number of grad students contributing to the wiki Users/MattCzarnowski

20051101 22:30:16 nbsp What about people who are not townies or UCD students?  I wouldnt consider myself either. Users/JanelleAlvstadMattson
  Yeah, I just read the townie page and didnt realize it has such a restrictive connotation. I hadnt contemplated the difference between (1) new nonuniversity davisites, (2) people who are affiliated with the university but in nonacademic positions, (3) professors, or (4) the significant others of any the above or students. Ive changed the above to nonstudent Davisites. At this point, breaking it down further would be silly there are only 36 people in the sample :) Users/CraigBrozinsky
  You can have your own category Student Affiliate Users/KenjiYamada

20051101 23:16:05 nbsp Im actually kinda curious about age ratios, now that more DHS students are getting into the wiki, even though only me and Norris really pay attention to whats goin on. Users/JohnDudek

20051101 23:51:20 nbsp I would be very interested in finding out how many 1921 year old townie nonUCD twins use the wiki. Users/PhilipNeustrom
  4 identical, 6 fraternal, and 3 siamese. Im just as confused about that last one as you ...  Users/CraigBrozinsky cjb


20051102 00:19:58 nbsp we should make a form or something, and fill it out, example: i am a 20 y/o female, non UCD student, non davis resident, with 300+ edits etc Users/MichelleAccurso

20051102 00:23:03 nbsp An informal analysis of the top 25% reveals there to be 20 undergrads, 7 grad students, 5 nonstudent Davisites, and 4 people who neither live in Davis nor are currently affiliated with the University. as in user stats page? Users/MichelleAccurso

20060421 03:06:38 nbsp Wait how does the top 25% of 2438 36?  (Re: student status) Users/KrisFricke

20060421 03:51:28 nbsp 25% of 144, the # of users who had made 50+ edits as of 103105, and so qualified for these stats, is 36 Users/MaxMikalonis

20100318 11:35:30 nbsp I found this information pretty interesting and thought Id bump it onto recent changes.  Has data like this been collected since 2005?  If not, it might be interesting to collect it again and see how (if?) things have changed. Users/TomGarberson
