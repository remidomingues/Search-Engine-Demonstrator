  Users/ZacMorris Zac Morris  I wrote some code for some obscure function thats not actually in use yet.  I also made it so you can use {{{br}}} instead of {{{BR}}}, which... also isnt in use yet.  Im the useless developer.
  The use of {{{BR}}} and {{{br}}} is no longer necessary. Sorry Zac.

Background
We started the site using http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de/ MoinMoin, a popular wiki engine.  However, we have throughly hacked the http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de/ MoinMoin code in nearly every respect.  We maintain information about our opensource wiki software, called Sycamore, at http://projectsycamore.org.

For our sitesearch we are using the http://xapian.org Xapian API.  Its an indexing and querying system that seems to work well.

More can be found in Wiki History.

Help wanted
Anchor(help) Got a special talent?  Put it to good use by helping out!

  Graphics:  All of the graphics are currently done by the programmers.  We would ideally like to have one or more dedicated graphics artists to help develop a consistent look throughout the interface as well as design new Wiki Logo logos and Wiki Flyer flyers.
  Davis Wiki CSS CSS:  If you have extensive experience with CSS, you can help us streamline our design and make it easier to maintain.
  Programming:  We are looking for people with experience in the following: Python, C++, Java, XML, database programming.  Depending on your availability and experience, the work may range from bug fixes and small features to fullscale overhauls as we strive for scalability and efficiency.
  System Administrators:  Weve got our own server, and we can do most things ourselves, but an extremely experienced system administrator who can help us install packages and solve problems quickly would be ideal.

If you would like to help please contact Users/PhilipNeustrom.

Would Daviswiki like $500?  Heres the deal:  I need Sycamore installed on my inhouse corporate server, but first I need it modified to accept text, pdf and doc attachments.  Modify Sycamore, help me install it on my server, and Ill a) donate $500 to your fund and b) contact a couple of my local corporate friends and see if they will make matching donations.  Heres the fine print:My server runs Windows Server 2003.  Apache and perl are already installed and working.  I must have enough information to create documentation on how to do a baremetal restore of Sycamore. For the donation, I need some document showing your taxexempt status or else Ill have to give it to an individual along with a 1099 form. The $500 is due and payable when Sycamore is up and running to my satisfaction. If anyone is interested in helping me, please contact me at jstewart@jkmicro.com or call 2976073 and ask for Jim
