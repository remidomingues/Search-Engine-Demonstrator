Welcome to the Wiki Wiki Enthusiast. Please also read the Welcome to the Wiki general welcome.

 1. We have a different set of goals and social norms than http://www.wikipedia.org wikipedia. Entries tend to be written in a more familiar style, and we generally encourage creative editing when it helps explain the content of a page. Youll note that opinions pervade the wiki: ultimately, we aim to integrate comments into the content of the article, but we also respect the power of comments in conveying how many people support one side of an issue.
 1. Our markup is also a little bit different, see wiki:wikispot:Help with Editing.
 1. We are not a neutral point of view (NPOV) wiki.  We think its good to establish and develop multiple points of view within the text of a page, rather than get lost in trying to enforce some arbitrary sense of neutrality.
 1. Talk pages are available, but tend not to be used very much.  Unless a big dispute is going on, its probably better to just ask a question on an article, or just edit the page and see what happens.
 1. As this is a locallyoriented website, we encourage original research from those who know best  firsthand observers.  We also try to keep the site Davisrelated, though some pages of interest outside the city are kept around.
 1. If you have content for something near Davis consider if it belongs on one of the nearby wikis; you can always use an interwiki link to from Davis Wiki to that page.  On the other hand, if it is is of interest to the Davis community (for instance, something not available in Davis that the people of Davis would travel for), or is strongly related to Davis (UC Davis fields and facilities outside Davis), it may well belong on the wiki with a Davis oriented perspective (directions, local relevance, etc).
