This page is intended to be a discussion of wiki etiquette and how to deal with disputes between editors, problem editors/comments, and so on.

The initial content here isnt intended to reflect format or anything like that; its just a list of some topics that have come up in the past and might be worth discussing.

 Archiving 
  Archiving should be allowed as long as its not an extended, interwoven discussion.
  What benefit does it bring, though?  Archiving for archivings sake removes content about X from the page about X.  Thats not to say its never a good thing.  Its a useful tool in certain circumstances.  It can address problems of relevance or messy pages.  But its a means to an end, not an end in itself.  Removing information from a page without a specific reason to do so goes against the central purpose of this wiki. Users/TomGarberson
    Its not removing content Tom...if someone is going to go somewhere and wants RECENT comments, who wants to dig through 3 pages of old comments to get to the new stuff?? Users/PeterBoulay
     In the interest of avoiding having two different discussions on the same topic, Im going to reply on the Fluffy Donuts page for now, and once weve got the specific case figured out, come back to the general. tg

 Reverting 
  Leaving a message explaining why you reverted (or intend to revert, if they dont fix it?)
  An edit comment explaining the revert makes the message generally unnecessary.
  Talk pages  worth creating after a couple of consecutive reverts?

 Suspect Comments 
  Serious accusations
   Barefoot Yoga Studio
  Likely sock puppets
  Inflammatory comments that are too vague to really evaluate

 New Users Who Dont Know Wiki Norms 
  Welcoming
  Giving them the benefit of the doubtwhere does the assumption that they mean well but just dont get it end?

 OffWiki Contact to Resolve Problems 
  When issues arise and editors discuss resolutions offwiki, what goes on in that discussion doesnt become a part of the wikis record.  If other people involved in a dispute object, should there be a time when we insist that before changes get made, the discussion occur on the wiki, and not just that it occur?

 Legal Threats 
  What kind of response do they deserve (obviously this is going to vary somewhat depending on the type of threat)
  Differentiating between vague, stop defaming me type things and actual legal threats. There are pages on the wiki to help differentiate between slander and libel, but the wiki falls under the category of a common carrier, so threatening a suit reveals the person who does to be someone who shows poor form.

 Disagreements 
  Please dont threaten to quit the wiki over a discussion where someones opinion differs from yours.  Its bad manners.  It also tends to stomp on any discussion under way without accomplishing a thing.

 Etiquette Pages 
  Are they a terrible idea thatll waste excessive amounts of editor time and detract from more productive editing on the wiki?
  Will they blow up in your face?
