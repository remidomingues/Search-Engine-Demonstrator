Discussion:

Users/mperkel I would like to create a Facebook App for DavisWiki.
I have already started the actual app on Facebook, but would need help from this community as well as whoever actually runs this site.
I think this app would be a great way to get DavisWiki out there more for the people of Davis.
It could be as simple as an embedded page for DavisWiki on facebook.
I dont know much of the coding, nor do I have capability of hosting app pages.
Anyone interested to help, I can add you to the developers list.
Just wanted to start a discussion on if this would be a good idea or not.
