Wiki Fatigue can be recognized by several syndromes:

 1. Fear of what you will see next in Recent Changes rather than looking forward to new developments.
 1. Assuming that new posters are actively trying to damage the wiki rather than assuming that they just need help and guidance.
 1. Seeing sockpuppets behind every other post.
 1. Fantasies about removing all of the edits youve ever made and all the PhotoRequest photos youve uploaded.
 1. Urge to publicly identify posters like Users/MyNameDoesntMatter with their real name.
 1. Longing for a good Users/SteveOstrowski revert war as opposed to more recent dramas.
 1. Wanting to create a pseudonymous account and stoop below the lowest common denominator.

If you experience any of these syndromes it is time to take a wiki vacation.
