I was just daydreaming and I thought Wouldnt it be cool if a bunch of us got together to go on a field trip somewhere? Perhaps this is another one of my whacked ideas (OK, I know it is), but is there any interest in this? Just a few people that would like to perhaps go on an adventures outside of Davis? Or in Davis? Tour a company? See some art? Attend an event? Perhaps were all introverts and the only thing we have in common is sitting alone editing the wiki. Users/SteveDavison

20051222 15:19:29 nbsp Whats happening with this, steve? Users/ArlenAbraham

20051223 11:10:49 nbsp Glad you asked, Arlen! Absolutely nothing. The truth is we really are all antisocial people who just sit at our computers writing oblique insults about each other. Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to be a normal person... Users/SteveDavison
  The only normal people are the ones you dont know very well. Alfred Adler...trips should very fun, but a topic of interest or hobby may make it easier to plan and get people out.

20051223 11:29:11 nbsp Nope, Im up for it. Users/AndrewBanta

20051223 15:41:49 nbsp when? where? whos driving? Users/CindySperry

20051223 15:53:05 nbsp I think a Wikitrip that would make sense would be a Napa adventure.  Of course that might exclude some under21year olds.  But its a thought. Users/JaimeRaba

20051224 01:49:14 nbsp Why are people on the wiki antisocial. The wiki events board is a good promotion tool. i would think frequent users of the wiki would be someone more likely to show up to an event listed on the events board. Im not saying a field trip isnt a fun idea Im just saying the wiki seems to be watering down events by having them just too damn often. Users/RobRoy

20060226 14:52:18 nbsp im up, or down, whichever Users/MichelleAccurso

20060226 15:21:11 nbsp Id be down for a Jelly Belly tour or similar.  Mini Golf, Bowling adventure at the MU would also not leave the under 21 crowd out. Users/TarZxf
 Candy is always good. I know yolobus goes to Vacaville, but I dont know if it goes near the factory. Users/NickSchmalenberger
  We could get a car pool going, I bet AndrewBanta would drive, and between he and I thats ten people, which is about the size of your average BBQ attendees. Users/MichelleAccurso

20060309 20:10:44 nbsp Ive not read all these comments, but Id like to do it. Ive fallen away from the wiki for a while now, and I think that itd be cool to get back in touch with everything. Users/JohnDudek

20060314 01:19:09 nbsp We could go to... Ikea! Users/SteveDavison
  Sounds good to me, I need a desk lamp. For extra adventure, maybe we could take public transit, or ride bikes. Users/NickSchmalenberger
    No dog sled? Users/TarZxf

20060314 13:31:08 nbsp im all for ikea Users/MichelleAccurso

20060314 13:39:18 nbsp If you go to Ikea, Hitler wins. Users/BrentLaabs

20060316 20:05:44 nbsp Hmmm.  I could use a desk lamp too.  BTW, I have a fullsize pickup truck if anyone wants to bring back anything that wont fit in their dogsled. Users/ErikAnderson
  Ill sell you my lamp or a cool green light pod.   Users/MarieHuynh
   Serendipitously enough, I found a desk lamp in my own garage, left behind by the previous tenant.  Maybe you can sell yours to Nick?

20060316 21:56:56 nbsp I dont think Ive ever been to that burger king.  And classes start on wed.  Why not tuesday? Users/MarieHuynh
  Classes are lame, thats why. Users/TarZxf

20060323 16:58:11 nbsp Id come, but I have to teach a class on Wednesday at noon so Im pretty much excluded from this venture. Users/BrentLaabs

20060323 18:47:39 nbsp would tuesday work for everyone? i work til about noon that  day but could make it Users/MichelleAccurso
  I cant do Tuesday. I have a class at 1:00 at Sacramento City College on Tuesday, but I could do Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20060323 23:12:28 nbsp I will like to go, but can we go on Tuesday  because class start on Wednesday Users/SimonFung
  What about Monday?
   monday is good, i work that morning so ill be available after noonish Users/MichelleAccurso
    Okay, what time? What happens to lunch at ikea? Does it become linner? Users/NickSchmalenberger

20060324 21:58:49 nbsp Monday just about any time is pretty good for me.  Ill probably come along. Users/BrentLaabs

20060325 23:09:33 nbsp Monday is better for me too; Wed has conflicts plus UCD is in session. Users/SteveDavison

20060326 18:39:25 nbsp Both Monday and Wednesday are fine for me, but it seemed like a lot more people could do it on Monday, so I say do it Monday. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20060326 18:43:09 nbsp i work on monday, so if we could do it sometime after or at one, id appreciate it Users/MichelleAccurso

20060326 21:39:47 nbsp Yes, I support this afternoon plan as well, mainly because Ive been getting to sleep pretty late during spring break. Users/BrentLaabs

20060327 15:17:10 nbsp crap, I slept through everything Users/NickSchmalenberger
  and you dont have an alarm clock? Users/MichelleAccurso
   I do. I set it for 11 am and when I woke up it was 3 pm. I think it is braindamaged from having been beaten up on too many times. Really, I just need to get a normal sleep schedule instead of staying up late reading all the time. So, how did it go? Users/NickSchmalenberger
    oye, that sucks. it was fun, Users/BrentLaabs Brent Users/Tarzxf Neal Users/ErikAnderson Erik and myself were there. we bought stuff, yay.

20060327 19:37:55 nbsp Moving a date forward a day before an event happens is an exceedingly bad idea. I was expecting Wednesday. Drat! Users/SteveDavison

20060327 19:39:45 nbsp If you plan an event in the future SET THE DATE WELL IN ADVANCE AND NEVER MOVE A DATE BACKWARDS. Users/SteveDavison
  I agree.  But take heart  well get better at this with more practice.  ;) Users/ErikAnderson

20060327 20:12:00 nbsp oh i think many of us would like to go wednesday again. erik is measuring and coming back. anyone up for wednesday? i know andrewbanta can make it and i would love to go Users/MichelleAccurso
  Hopefully it will stop RAINING on Wednesday, and that shelf thingy I want will still be in the store.  (It will fit) Users/ErikAnderson E
  Follow up: the shelf thingy was GONE!  If you snooze you loose, I guess.  :(

20060328 17:14:28 nbsp This is a good idea... cant go tho. :) Users/TusharRawat

20090615 15:10:00 nbsp So I really like this page wiki:Sacramento:Yogurtagogo, and how they have used the wiki. Is anybody interested in going here maybe in a week or two?  Users/NickSchmalenberger
