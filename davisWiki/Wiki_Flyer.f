Flyering is one of the many forms of Free Community Advertising that Davis Wiki and other groups use. While not entirely free, flyers are pretty cheap to make and free to post. To help advertise the DavisWiki, start with a http://www.daviswiki.org/cool_files/logo.pdf fullpage PDF of the logo or http://www.daviswiki.org/cool_files/logo.swf the same thing in Flash. Then just make your own flyers, but post them here first to get some feedback. Another way to help might be to create a Wiki Desktop Wallpaper and put it on as many multiuser computers as you can. If you dont have any cash, learn the art of Opportunistic Wiki Advertising.


 Early Flyers 
 The First Flyer 
Users/PhilipNeustrom made the first Wiki Flyer (08/4/04), and it looks like this:


I plan to pass it out to friends and people that look like they might be interested.  I might leave some at Cafe Roma.  Users/PhilipNeustrom

And now, check out this awesome ASCII flyer:

I <3 oldskool  Users/MarieHuynh
   Me too.  I have a bunch of them printed out and I gave them to Users/PaulIvanov to put up around Kemper Hall and so forth  but he never put even a single one up.  So much for him, eh.  Maybe I should print more and do it myself.  Users/PhilipNeustrom

 Secondary Efforts 
The plan (a while ago):
 Soon we will be going public, and this entails some publicity and advertisement.  We will, of course, need to be careful at first as to where we advertise.  It would be much better to build the site slowly than have it rapidly explode.  However, a lot of energy can build if we have a good base to start off with (growth is VERY good!)  Advertisement in the right places would be a good idea (at first)  but generally the WikiWay will take care of growth problems.

 Flyering in the dorms is not allowed. I went down to Student Housing to ask if theyd let RAs put up flyers on the floors. They told me that only campus organizations can do that.  Users/JackHaskel

 2004 Flyers 
Idea for the early fall flyers:
 A new flyer should be made.  It should be well designed and stand out.  The first flyer was tiny and designed to be only kind of noticed.  It also had a lot of text.  Users/MikeIvanov should post the postscript version of the logo so that work can be done on a new flyer.  Also, flyer can be taken to mean larger piece of paper put in places like Wellman Hall.  Maybe we ought to have smaller flyers to hand out and larger ones to post around.

 2/3 of the early fall flyers 
(Users/MikeIvanov needs to upload the other one)



 2005 Flyers 
 Fall 
Please crop the flyers neatly before posting or distributing. The OMG, WTF flyers are based on Judson Wickhams original idea.


 Spring 
Theres also a http://daviswiki.org/cool_files/flyerunquarter.pdf quarter sheet version of the Un flyer  print the file four to a page.
  Isnt there 4171 pages and counting now? It would be great to boast 4171 pages, but how many are just completely underdeveloped stubs (e.g., municipal codes). Is there a stat that uses some kind of a word count command?



 Summer 
Following the advice of Eric Redpath, I opened You are the Editor in Photoshop and inverted it, making it look about 10 times better. Can someone do this with the vector graphics?  Users/ArlenAbraham arlen


 DavisWiki Card 
Hmmm... look what I just found in my wallet. Many of these were made (and theres still quite a few).  Its hard finding a good place to put them, though.



I have one in my business card drawer here.  Thats a bit over 2,600 miles away.  Anybody carry theirs to a farther destination? Users/JabberWokky

 Brainstorming 

 Lambert designs 
Heres a design for a handout that Users/SteveLambert designed a while back.  It was never printed but itd be a good idea for us to print it up.  Potentially via http://www.moo.com/ moo.com?

20050414 08:31:59 nbsp Great new flyers! Users/JackHaskel

20050414 13:14:12 nbsp Glad you like them.  Let me know how the 2,700 photos one looks printed in black and white. Users/MikeIvanov

20050428 10:35:26 nbsp Ill be handing out quarter sheets today around campus. If anyone sees me and wants to help or wants some fliers just ask. Users/JackHaskel

20050610 15:04:50 nbsp Quickly, print flyers before the quarter ends! Users/ArlenAbraham
  I second this! I printed about 300 flyers today using a combination of my account and other peoples accounts!  I also think a good idea would be printing out random useful pages.  To get a good print version of a page click Info then click print on the most recent version.  I printed out the Campus Staplers (sans the unintegrated comments) page but I encourage you to be creative! Users/PhilipNeustrom

20050615 11:05:37 nbsp Go, Go, Go! Print, Print, Print. Its freee! Users/MichaelGiardina

20050615 12:36:54 nbsp Ive always used my last print sheets for wiki flyers but this quarter I have no extras. If anyone wants to give me fliers Ill be happy to put them up. Id recommend making the quarter sheets. Theyre a lot of fun to give out! Users/JackHaskel

20050727 15:18:02 nbsp heres a phrase DavisWiki.org, because you cant procasturbate at work Users/ArlenAbraham

20050817 22:13:57 nbsp I think that flyer would come out solid black on a laser printer. also, am i missing a pun here? Users/ArlenAbraham

20050817 23:55:59 nbsp Hahah I think that flyer is very bad PR for us.  Just creepy.  Were it a really hot girl, it might be more effective, but I think it captures little of what Davis Wiki is about and would confuse a person who doesnt already know about the site.  All the other flyers try to tell you something about why Davis Wiki is worth a visit.  This one would maybe appeal to people who already lick the wiki and might think Hey me too, cool. Users/MikeIvanov

20050818 11:49:38 nbsp Lol. It was more of a joke than anything. Feel free to delete lol. I did print 4 on glossy photo paper tho lol Users/MichaelGiardina

20050819 11:57:45 nbsp Haha. I love the lick poster. Id go to Davis Wiki if I saw that. Good job Giardina! Users/LizethCazares

20050913 16:17:32 nbsp I saw A Davis resource that doesnt suck that made me a Wikivangelest! I love that. Users/SteveDavison

20051111 08:06:15 nbsp I wish to praise whomever drew the YOU ARE THE EDITOR. Its clever, and drawn well. Users/SteveDavison

20051111 14:14:02 nbsp Thanks, it was Philips idea and I redrew it cleaned up and in vector form. Users/MikeIvanov

20051211 13:48:42 nbsp The end of the quarter is coming up. Use up those 100 sheets and print some flyers! Remember: CLM is enforcing a hardlimit of 100 pages before they start charging you. (It used to be a softlimit of 100 and a hardlimit of 200). Users/ArlenAbraham

20060927 19:00:42 nbsp Freshmen start their first classes very soon!  We should print out some flyers/make new ones and post them around campus or perhaps make hats out of them.  Users/PhilipNeustrom

20070928 12:38:44 nbsp The Fall 2005, single sentence fliers were reused for a campaign on September 27, 2007. Users/DavidPoole

20071004 14:41:01 nbsp Im interested to make phone number wallet cards for the wiki:Madison, but I cant seem to find the right supplies. Does anybody know what brand the folding business cards are and where I could get them? Also, if you have the template for the Davis cards, that would be great, otherwise, Ill just make up my own. Thanks in advance. (Leave links/files on my wiki:madison:Users/KarlMogel Madison Wiki Page.) Users/KarlMogel
