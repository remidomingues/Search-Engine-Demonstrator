### use this page to plan new gatherings and just link/direct to pages of all the others? Only 2 so far I know, but eventually there could be a lot...

Occasionally wiki gnomes leave their computer desks and gather together in the real world. What fun! What crapulence! Keep an eye on this page for information and news about this and other upcoming Wiki Gatherings! Sometimes the plate shows up.

If youre interested in tabling at the Farmers Market, comment on Wiki Promotion. There has also been a suggestion about a Wiki Field Trip.

Other:
  Davis Social Meeting (Dawiso)


I fear those who do not participate in such social things (Wiki BBQs) would feel excluded from the wiki. This is especially important because as far as I know this is merely a social event. Users/MikeIvanov proposed some sort of goodwilled collective gestures such as volunteer work so that this could be more than a social activity and could possibly raise awareness of the wiki. It is doubtlessly important to satiate our tummies and talk to one another, but I think we need to keep aware of potential effects. That being said, I think it is nice meeting each other and celebrating! Users/PhilipNeustrom
 I second (third?) that!  Users/CraigBrozinsky
  I really dont see how there can be any downside to this, considering this is optional, open to absolutely everyone (Wiki users or otherwise!), nonpolitical, and has no effect on anyones status or ability to use/edit the Wiki. If you are suggesting that we have an agenda for the gathering (in other words, combine it with a meeting), I think that could become exclusionary (people absent would not have input on proposals, etc.). Wiki promotion is fine (Im all in favor of Farmers Market tables), but I cant imagine how it could be combined with the BBQ. How does one make a social event for nonsocial people? That is not something I know. Users/SteveDavison

  I second SteveDavisons comment  I think its crucially important to have facetoface gatherings to help everyone feel part of a team. Since its completely open to everyone, it can only do good. People who dont make it will more likely feel that DavisWiki is a fun site than feel that theyve been left out. Users/NaBarry

20051211 21:28:49 nbsp In the future, I think we should try and get broader consensus on these events, so we can get more people to come.  I enjoy the events, and dont think we have too many of them, but we should try to involve more people.  Also, we should consider someones house when its cold out.  The park is just too cold for the winter. Users/JaimeRaba
 How do we get this broader consensus? The dates been on the events listing as well as here for a whole month. If you mean inclusive, ever notice said everyone is welcome just come. The majority of the feedback about the date (see above) was positive, so it seemed OK. I really dont understand why more people dont come especially the Wiki founders. We had free booze, free food, girls (may not have been free), what else do we need? Music? Rob Roy? Inside a house? Warmer weather? Users/SteveDavison
  If we need music for the next bbq, Users/AlexNorris and I will provide tunes from our folk/experimental band. We were going to do it this time, but Norris wasnt available, so next time... Also, though, I dont think we should get bands and people playing music though who arent wiki users, because that would be lame. Users/JohnDudek

  Broader consensus also means more interest in the event from the start (more planning, publicity).  By my count, the last BBQ proposal had only three confirmed attendees prior to it occurring, and no real food planning (at least on the page).  The more people and planning involved, the better the event will go!  Users/PhilipNeustrom

20061113 13:13:08 nbsp There hasnt been a meeting in almost a year now, guys. We should totally get that together. Those were so much fun, and I think therell be a bigger turnout, even if its a bunch of wiki n00bs and not wiki legends. Users/JohnDudek

20070305 10:40:53 nbsp Spring BBQ  Im seeing consistently lovely weather each day here. So Ill forward the argument that the time has come for another OMGLOLWIKIBBQ Wiki Barbecue this spring. Maybe coinciding with the beginning of Spring QTR? Perhaps Philip could suggest a date that would benefit one of his other projects... Users/KarlMogel
  Yeah it is a anwesome time and probably the right season for a BBQ, especially to relax given all the developments on the wiki. There was some talk awhile ago where everyone (Philip, Rob, Arlen etc.) thought this would be awesome, anything I can do to help? ~Users/Davidpoole

20070306 00:52:22 nbsp I would be down for BBQ. Anyone want to attend the west plainfield firefighter pancake breakfast? Users/StevenDaubert

20070306 02:59:35 nbsp I think one good possibility for volunteering would be http://www.treedavis.org/volunteer.html... Users/NickSchmalenberger

20080412 14:06:13 nbsp Anyone know about anything similar to this that happens around town?  Id love to join in on community gatherings where everyone is equal like this. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080429 00:44:36 nbsp When is the next Wiki gathering?  Im so down to get together! Users/CurlyGirl26

20080906 12:28:31 nbsp So anything prefall quarter? Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080906 14:21:16 nbsp How about the weekend before school starts up again?   Users/CurlyGirl26

20080906 14:32:36 nbsp Im going to be in town on the last weekend in September (and generally kicking around the area for the week leading up to it).  If theres anything on Saturday the 27th, Ill be there. Users/JabberWokky

20080906 14:50:27 nbsp I think we should definitely do it on that day!  How cool would it be if the great Users/JabberWokky were attending! Users/CurlyGirl26

20080906 16:23:31 nbsp September 27 would be good for me too, Im in Minnesota right now and plan on being back in Davis the 22 or 23. OMGWTFLOLWIKIBBQ! Users/NickSchmalenberger

20080919 20:01:44 nbsp Sarah and I arrived this morning at SFO.  If theres a Wiki gathering on the 27th, well be there.  Wed love to meet whoever shows up. Users/JabberWokky

20080919 20:59:32 nbsp It is certainly possible that I might come, although it might be hard to tell... :) Users/IDoNotExist
  Just like I told you today, these things always happen when Im not available!  Im getting home from my trip the following evening.  Eventually Ill get to attend a wiki gathering, I just know it! Users/StaceyEllis

20080920 12:41:46 nbsp Unfortunately Ill be working that entire weekend prepping the Mike Farrell book signing (Yay BJ Hunnicut!) at my work, so I wont be able to make it that weekend.  Looks like someone else will need to step up and organize it. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080922 22:11:21 nbsp Ive been on the road for awhile with spotty bandwidth and unable to follow the RC.  Anything going on this Saturday?  Anybody?  Buler?  Buler? Users/JabberWokky

20080923 00:15:27 nbsp It appears that there definitely may be, but so far there is no proposal for when or where.  Enough!  I say we solve this problem once and for all in the name of all that is good and easy to edit about the Wiki!  Let all Wiki users go forth and meet at Crepeville on Saturday the 27th at noon!  Let us wear funny hats or make easily identifiable waving motions to identify ourselves within the restaurant!  Let us order tasty crepes and salads and all manner of brunch!  Let us pay separately with cash and receive numbers, and with those numbers let us draw the servers who hold our orders to our tables, and let those servers place upon our tables those very same orders!  My fellow Wiki users, we must act together!  We must eat together!  We must exist together!  And we must probably work out together, because thats a lot of calories, really.  But if you do not want to work out together, I will surely understand.  Users of the Wiki, I call upon you to unite!

Unless no one can make it, of course.  In which case, we can reschedule.  No big deal. Users/IDoNotExist
    Works for me.  We could even pass across the street to the big open area there if we wish. jw

20080923 13:07:58 nbsp Theres also the farmers market across the street, but I figure that it would be hard for people to spot each other there, and it will likely be quite hot. Users/IDoNotExist

20080923 14:02:38 nbsp Ill be there Saturday unless I have to work.  It is a possibility, but I do want to join the gathering. Users/CurlyGirl26

20080924 00:36:50 nbsp I thought another bbq in the afternoon/evening would be good, as it is now it conflicts with the Installfest. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20080924 00:53:21 nbsp The later in the day you get, the more likely that it will conflict with peoples work or studying. Users/IDoNotExist

20080927 10:32:36 nbsp Im working until 4 or 5 so I wont be able to make it this time. Users/CurlyGirl26

20080927 10:47:33 nbsp The gathering just wont be as curly without you! Users/IDoNotExist

20080927 11:06:09 nbsp Im manning my store alone for most of the day and wont get someone to cover me till around 3pm. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20081122 18:27:19 nbsp Oh geez.  I forgot about that Dawiso thing I started...I guess we should do a winter bbq at some point. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20081122 19:18:35 nbsp Good idea.  We should have a winter get together. Users/CurlyGirl26

20081122 19:44:27 nbsp BBQd winter!  Agreed! Users/IDoNotExist

20090102 10:55:53 nbsp Ok, so I also ended up forgetting about the winter BBQ.  Also, Im starting to not like the name Davis Social Meeting cause it reminds me of World War II...not sure why.  Anywho, there probably should be some planning for a January BBQ.  Im thinking in a couple weeks or so.  Maybe on a Sunday. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

   Yes, its a really lame name.

20090102 12:16:55 nbsp Thats because people were only social during World War II.  After that, people only had antisocial gatherings. Users/IDoNotExist
  Davis AntiSocial Gathering Users/MichelleAccurso

20090102 12:41:22 nbsp I vote for Davis Shindig Association. Users/BrentLaabs

20090102 13:37:58 nbsp Davis Antisocial Venue Interaction Scenario (DAVIS) Users/IDoNotExist
my partner thinks your reaching... Daubert

20090102 17:43:47 nbsp yes! i have a shirt that i cant wear anywhere that says i fucking love davis, ca i like the D.A.V.I.S. title! Users/MichelleAccurso
 Come back to Davis and well go someplace where you can wear it. :) wl

20090110 13:27:49 nbsp So this is going to be January 18? Sounds good to me, I think I will bring some pasta salad. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20090110 13:48:55 nbsp January 18th where and when? Users/IDoNotExist

20090110 13:55:30 nbsp Slide Hill Park? 2 PM? Users/NickSchmalenberger

20090110 14:03:30 nbsp I may or may not exist then.  I make no guarantees.  :)  Can I suggest doing something indoors though  it could be raining or cold then, and it would be a shame if turnout was low because of the weather... Users/IDoNotExist

  Indoor bbq?  Sounds hazardous and somewhat like the time I tried to bake with parchment paper (flambe!).  Count me in! Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20090110 18:04:49 nbsp I usually try to bake using a stove.  How did you do it using paper? Users/IDoNotExist

  I believe that was the problem. As great as a chef as I am, my methods are mysterious even to me. Users/SunjeetBaadkar


20090111 10:19:48 nbsp Current forecast for next weekend is sunny and relatively warm (58F). While I realize this could change, I think its reasonable at this point to propose Slide Hill Park with a backup plan. Users/JessicaLuedtke

20090111 20:12:11 nbsp Ill actually be in Davis on the x17thx18th.  I just might be able to go. Users/RyanMikulovsky
  Itll be your chance to meet some nonwiki:chico Chico Wiki folk!  Whoo! Users/StaceyEllis

20090111 20:18:53 nbsp This must have been poor planning on someones part because I will actually be able to attend this one.  It ruins my whole lets plan a wiki gathering while Stacey is out of town conspiracy theory!  Looking forward to it! Users/StaceyEllis

20090111 23:54:04 nbsp Im in.  Maybe I can convince My Partner to come with me.  :) Users/CurlyGirl26

20090114 14:52:59 nbsp I thought it was supposed to be on the 18th.  Ill be sure to drag along as many people as I can and bring random foods. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20090114 16:54:14 nbsp Can we move this to Saturday the 24th at 2 PM?  That would correspond to when I would be in town for the Wiki Spot Board Meeting. Unless someone else wants to take over my grilling duties. Also, it might give us a better chance to promote it.  Users/BrentLaabs

20090114 17:51:28 nbsp Um, what? The board meeting agenda page currently says that is the 17th. Users/NickSchmalenberger
  No it doesnt. BL :P

20090114 20:48:42 nbsp Great, I just realized I work the 17th, 18th, and 24th.  So it seems I will be missing out on all of this, no matter which date is decided. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20090115 00:45:42 nbsp Hi, Sunjeet;   Ill be sure to record and archive the conference call. Users/Graham.Freeman

  Sweet.  I would like the minutes of the meeting notarized and translated into Swahili as soon as possible afterwards.  Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20090508 12:03:57 nbsp I havent been to a wiki barbecue since December 2005!!! There should be one happening this summer, as Im sure you are all aware. Who wants to organize it? Im voting Slide Hill Park again, as thats the classic scenario. I miss everybody. Users/JohnDudek

20090616 16:33:11 nbsp How about July 18th?  I can organize it. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20090616 16:43:44 nbsp Sounds good.  Suggest doing it inside.  It will be very hot in July... Users/IDoNotExist

20090630 16:39:57 nbsp And ends up Im working on the 18th, so someone else would have to do it. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20090630 17:32:40 nbsp We should schedule it for a day when you can come... Users/IDoNotExist

20090710 20:38:53 nbsp So, is July 18th actually happening? Users/BrentLaabs

20090729 15:05:25 nbsp How would September 5 work? Users/NickSchmalenberger

20100308 21:00:05 nbsp Looks like its been a while since the last gathering.  Is anyone in the habit of organizing these things, or is it kinda whoever steps up to the plate? Users/TomGarberson
  Well, it was me for a while, but Ive left Davis.  So just be the one to keep the ball rolling, and you too can start your very own gathering.  Users/BrentLaabs

20100308 21:32:16 nbsp Spring Gathering!!!!  Lets get it going Users/OliviaY
  Im going to throw Sunday, March 28 out there as a date for a potluck BBQ.  Am I right in thinking thats the end of peoples spring break?? Users/TomGarberson

20100308 22:04:05 nbsp You never know if I might be there.  For that matter, I dont either.  But I wouldnt even be there if I were, right? Users/IDoNotExist

20100309 23:56:43 nbsp How about April 4th instead since its the first weekend after the start of spring quarter?  Il actually be able to show up this time and might even bring the Wizard with me. Users/OliviaY

20100310 00:04:03 nbsp The Wizard? Users/IDoNotExist
  The wizard of a magical place, over a rainbow often found by use of a tornado and kansas farm home....Users/OliviaY

20100310 00:09:19 nbsp Maybe I can bring Elphaba... Users/IDoNotExist

20100318 12:33:20 nbsp April 4 is Easter.  What would people say to Sunday, April 11 for another potluck BBQ? Users/TomGarberson
  Perfect. I forgot that passover didnt end by the 4th so the 11th is definitely better. Users/OliviaY

20100406 15:27:42 nbsp As PN pointed out, its short notice and were looking at a rainy forecast for this weekend.  What would people think of either Saturday, Apr. 17 or Sunday, Apr. 18? Users/TomGarberson
  I like that better. I do not have anything big due the next week. Users/hankim

20100406 16:42:37 nbsp 17th is picnic day so 18th would be better Users/OliviaY
  If people can survive their hangovers. Maybe we should have a Davis Wiki booth or something somewhere. Users/hankim
  Agreed, 18th would probably be the way to go if we do it that weekend.  Or we could wait until the end of the month. tg

20101109 23:17:40 nbsp Anyone interested in a late fall gathering, maybe early December (4th or 5th)?  The weather is getting a little sketchy, but we could plan on something indoors.  Gather at a Pizza pizza parlor or something?  Any other suggestions?

20110307 12:05:55 nbsp How about a Wiki gathering Saturday, May 7 or Sunday, May 8?  BBQ at Slide Hill Park, as usual? Users/TomGarberson
   Sounds good to me.  Ill be there.  jw
   Ill try my best to be there if you guys decide upon that weekend. Looking forward to meeting you all.  Users/ScottMeehleib
  Thats the weekend of Whole Earth Festival, which will distract a few folks.
    I would think either the week before or after would be better due to this event. I really prefer to stay indoors during this festival.
     The main draw of that particular weekend is that JW will be in town.  Also, presumably wed head to slide hill park, miles and miles away from Whole Earth.  Whether thats a pro or a con is up to the individual :) TG
     Yeah, I think it really should be done during a time that JW is available. For me, anyway, its one of the big draws. :) SM
       Well, I was trying to avoid having my schedule affect things too much, but I certainly do appreciate (and reciprocate) wanting to get together.  Sarah has a wedding shower shes involved with on sometime Saturday evening (according to the bride), so Saturday afternoon would work for both of us, or I can stick around if she has to go do wedding stuff.  Were also going to be in town for a few days before and after, visiting friends and family.  We have lots of people to see, many whom  believe it or not  have never edited the wiki!  Point is, well be around for more than just the weekend, and last time we were in town there were also some casual wiki gettogethers at restaurants, so if WEF eats the BBQ, theres still opportunities to meet. jw
    I think May 7 or 8 is fine.  Theres still the entirety of the other day to go visit the WEF...plus too much patchouli can be bad for your brain (or maybe just mine)so itll be good to get away.  oy
     Since May 8 is Mothers Day, lets make it May 7.  If anyone has any objections, speak up; otherwise, May 7 it is! tg

20111212 09:23:54 nbsp Users/PhilipNeustrom suggested we might want some Davis edit sessions / gatherings / hangouts to check out the new Sacwiki thats being rolled out. That way Davisites could get used to the new code before it actually rolls out to Davis. (Currently http://sacwiki.org Sacwiki is still on the old code, and the new code is up on test site. It will be rolled over to sacwiki.org soon, though.) Any interest? Users/NicholasBarry
  I could be available for some SacWiki time after the holidays. Users/jefftolentino
