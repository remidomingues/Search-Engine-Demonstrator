 Where to Hide a Dead Body on the Wiki 

The Wiki provides a rich and cluttered environment ideal for the surreptitious disposal of formerly living entities.  These FLEs can be placed in a wide variety of entries including, but not limited to:

  One of Users/AlphaDogs many botany oriented entries
  Woven into one of Users/ArlenAbrahams theories about the wiki
  Inside the Mystery Picture of the moment
    Note that this has nothing to do with Plutos Mushrooms of the Moment and cannot be considered a claim or attack on any trademarks held by PlutosCorps.
  Brought to a Wiki Gatherings Wiki Gathering, preferably set to some wiki:WikiPedia:Oingo_Boingo Oingo Boingo music.
  Dumped in the trunk of Users/TarZxfs dusty Wiki Dude diesel Jetta
  Somewhere in the Friends Urging Campus Kindness Platform, between the staplers and the countback amendment.  No one will ever read something that ridiculously long.

Its not just the wiki that has incensed reviewers... or cool business owners.
(Honestly, what is it about restaurants?  You ate a lousy meal.  Okay...)
