The arrow and circle logo for the wiki is designed to evoke the signs for Bike Circle bike circles and roundabouts that are littered about Davis.  The logo often changes for holidays.  Upload a logo here for an upcoming holiday and it will be used!  Dont worry about formatting or other technical details, as it can be converted into something that works.  You also might want to leave Users/JabberWokky a message, especially if its a procrastination last minute upload.



History

This is the very first logo used on the Davis Wiki.  It was used along with plain text.


It was supposed to remind you of the signs for Bike Circle bike circles and roundabouts that are littered about Davis:


 

This logo was designed for the new theme:


You can grab a full page pdf of the logo (File(logo.pdf)) and also the same thing in flash (File(logo.swf)) and the same thing in SVG (File(logo.svg))

In my opinion, this logo looks better with a tag line:

 Suggested holiday logos 
If youd like to make a logo for the wiki, just upload it to this page sometime around the date of a holiday.  If its good well throw it up as the logo.

 Other ideas 

This one was a brainstorm idea that made Users/PhilipNeustrom piss his pants:


Here is another logo idea, featuring a water tower (which was rejected because it looks like some kind of jelly fish)  Maybe an alien landing craft?:


Here is a takeoff on the Welcome to Davis sign:



20040801 05:14:11 nbsp I like the Welcome to Davis Wiki sign, but I think itd look better if we actually vandalized a sign.  Users/PhilipNeustrom

20040801 07:34:54 nbsp Also, Mike, the new sign actually smashes into the login boxes when youre not logged in  Users/PhilipNeustrom

20040801 18:48:18 nbsp Sorry about that.  You see, at my high resolution, its hard to fathom there wont be room for something on someones screen.  But Ill take it off for now until we figure out if it even belongs anywhere.  Users/MikeIvanov

20041126 20:57:21 nbsp I live the bicycle friendle wiki one  Users/RohiniJasavala

20041219 04:50:22 nbsp wow. i got to be the first person to see the christmas logo. i honestly feel very honored  Users/RobRoy

20050213 23:59:43 nbsp I <3 the green one Users/MarieHuynh

20050317 17:34:59 nbsp i saw that Berkeley wiki page right now < http://www.csua.berkeley.edu/~tobin/wiki/moin.cgi > and you guys at Davis Wiki have beat them up hands down. Thats awsome that we are actually better than Berkeley at something. Long live wiki! Users/GeorgejAndrews

20050319 13:13:30 nbsp I just checked out the Berkeley page as well and cant believe how...dull...it is! Users/BevSykes

20050328 01:18:49 nbsp I love the Easter logo! Great job, Mike!! Users/AlphaDog

20050722 16:14:19 nbsp Any chance of getting some DavisWiki Logo window stickers?  White on clear, possibly with daviswiki.org below. Users/TarZxf

20050722 16:17:43 nbsp We were looking into that a while ago.  Clear cling stickers are pretty pricy, though.  Maybe someones got a hookup? Users/MikeIvanov

20050919 23:17:37 nbsp I like all the theme logos. Users/KenjiYamada

20050919 23:21:08 nbsp Thank you, thank you.  Any requests for upcoming holidays that I dont know about? Users/MikeIvanov

20050919 23:48:30 nbsp Thank you guys! Look forward to upcoming HyperText : Users/VivianPham

20051012 22:35:44 nbsp I love A Davis resource that doesnt suck and Robs Edit this Tshirt. I think black on white would be better, to be like the black on white text of the Wiki. I like the roundabout logo, its like pages being endlessly reedited/recycled, I say keep it. Users/SteveDavison

20051031 21:00:25 nbsp Ooh, the new halloween one is my favorite so far! Users/MiriamKaufman

20051101 09:35:53 nbsp The day after Halloween logo is PIMP! Users/JackHaskel

20051124 16:37:52 nbsp Ok, I found a couple of minutes to at least put up what I have for Thanksgiving.  Its not finished or polished, but hopefully better than nothing. Users/MikeIvanov
  I liked it!  Too bad it was only up for a short time and few saw it. Users/PhilipNeustrom

20060329 03:53:10 nbsp JELLYFISHES!!!    ok that was childish, sorry..... JELLYFISHES!!!! haha. this page is awesome, awesome logos :) Users/TusharRawat

20060704 11:29:37 nbsp No Independence Day logo today? Users/AndrewChen
  I put up last years for today.  If anyones got something better (or in the future, if you want something) then please throw it up! Users/PhilipNeustrom

20060720 22:02:47 nbsp I just noticed the new logo  I really think its beautiful! Great work. Users/JosephBleckman

20060721 04:37:30 nbsp hahaha. Sweet logo. God, is the weather going to really be in the triple digits for the whole of next week too? It burns. Users/DatNguyen

20060726 09:49:14 nbsp Hmm. Maybe if we change the logo it will get cooler outside? Users/MichaelGiardina

20061223 11:51:47 nbsp Somebody ought to make a christmas logo! Users/PhilipNeustrom

20070213 23:41:20 nbsp None of the Valentines Day ones have skulls. That makes me sad (And Im not skilled enough to do the editing myself). Users/MaxMikalonis

20070410 14:56:06 nbsp On the picnic Day logo  what is the thing to the left? Users/SharlaDaly
   The 2007 Picnic Day Logo.  Its a weird, altered fingerprint thing.  I figured I should include it.  See Picnic Day 2007 for a larger version.  Im up for removing it, though. Users/JabberWokky

    I didnt know what it was, either.  I dont think many people will recognize it, even if its the official logo.  Something to the left in that logo would be good, though.  Maybe even the water tower? (old town feel, etc?)  Users/PhilipNeustrom
       In the layered original I named that layer Beehive, as it reminds me of a Beehive hairdo.  I agree, and if nobody else edits it by Saturday, Ill change it myself, but Im hoping somebody kicks in their own variation.  I uploaded the psd file for it (made in Gimp, I assume Photoshop, Gimp and Paint Shop Pro can read it).  Its in the files for this entry named Picnic 2007.psd: File(Picnic 2007.psd) Users/JabberWokky

20070510 17:36:21 nbsp We need a Whole Earth Festival WEF logo! Users/PhilipNeustrom

Maybe for the WEF you could make one that uses the Daviswiki logo in the place of the little recycling arrows that are on the bottom of plastic bottles and cans.  I would do it myself but all I have is Paint program and OpenOffice Draw.   Users/MaryLieth

Heres my first test logo:


I need some help making the two is look more like tiki torches.

20090218 21:24:43 nbsp Hello, fellow Daviswikians. It has been a while, but recently since moving to Ithaca NY I have been working on another wiki http://ithaca.wikispot.org/. Anyways I was wandering how you guys designed the logos. Im a total beginner, and the general wikispot page on logos seemed to be more about concept ideas, rather than how to actually make the logo. Thanks
 Users/MattHh
    Just use any image editing program.  Its a good idea to keep the logo around 200 to 400 pixels wide by 50 to 60 pixels tall.  There is also a background image that can be used as a logo, but that requires some HTML/CSS know how that is a bit confusing at first.  Basically, you want to create a PNG file (it should be an option when you save... if not, and youre really stuck, you can send me a GIF file, and Ill mail it back to you as a PNG), and upload it to your wiki settings page.  Also, if you want to just focus on your content and ask somebody to do it for you, the wiki:gnome Gnome HQ has an interwiki group of technically skilled editors who volunteer to handle some of the dirty work until the local community is large enough to have their own technically skilled members. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

   Users/MikeIvanov is really the guy to ask.  Hes a logo genius, if you ask me.  I think what he tended to do was spend an embarrassingly disproportionate amount of time on each logo (various holidays) and be a complete prefectionist.  Id start with sketching out ideas on paper, then use something like http://www.inkscape.org/ Inkscape.  You can see some discussion on how we settled on the wiki:wikispot:Logo ideas Wiki Spot logo and the wiki:sf:logo brainstorming SF wiki logo (probably a better example).   Users/PhilipNeustrom

20091221 12:16:49 nbsp I threw up an older holiday logo just now.  If anyone wants to make a newer one: please do! Users/PhilipNeustrom

Do we have a larger version of http://daviswiki.org/Wiki_Logo?actionFiles&doview&targetdaviswiki.png the main logo?

20111115 17:43:36 nbsp I propose we participate in http://americancensorship.org/ American Censorship Day tomorrow.  http://blog.wikimedia.org/2011/11/15/wikimediasupportsamericancensorshipday/ Wikipedia is participating and the legislation threatens the future of DavisWiki and sites like it.  What do yall think? Users/PhilipNeustrom
 Sure. Might as well  Users/ScottMeehleib
  Lets do it.   Users/CovertProfessor
  Agreed Users/TomGarberson
  Agree 100% Users/WesP
  Agree 100% Users/PeterBoulay
  By all means
    So, where is it?  cp
    Kinda my thought.  I just got a IM asking about it.  I can do one, but I thought Philip had one.  Note that the official one requires access to HTML, rather than just the image.  jw
     Okay, Im doing one, but I would like to ask everybody to contribute to the About SOPA tab. jw
      So theres a basic one.  Hurm.  How about Save the Wiki instead of Stop Censorship?  Theres a whole censorship flavor to most of the rants and content on the net in general, but locally, were more worried about a specific possible outcome. jw
      Thanks for the logo!  I was going to go with that black bar thing, but itd actually look pretty weird because weve got a black background.  Ive made the logo link to the What is SOPA page, which I think should do the trick.   Users/PhilipNeustrom
      One day, or longer?  Im loathe to abuse the logo, even for a good cause.  One day, however, doesnt catch people who only check in now and then. jw
        Personally, Id like to see it up until the end of the week. But I wont cry if somebody decides to take it down. ;) SM
           End of the week sounds good to me... perhaps through the weekend, then remove?  cp
             Works for me.  jw
               I took SOPA down because of the police response yesterday.  International news now so we should keep it as the most prominent item on the front page, IMO.  Users/PhilipNeustrom
                Yes, that makes sense.  cp

Update: There appears to be a coordinated internetwide blackout planned for Jan 18th.  Wikipedia is considering a full sitewide blackout.  Should we join in and put the logo up as we did before?  This isnt a theoretical here, either  both Boxer and Feinstein are cosponsors of the Protect IP Act.   Users/PhilipNeustrom

  Is a DW blackout an option or are you just thinking logo change?  Id favor participating in the blackout coordination, but logo is fine too. JT
    We could do a blackoutstyle thing too.  I know there was a plan for some simple little snippet you could put into a site to make it have a call your legislators form, but Im not sure where that is.  If theres something simple like that then we should take a look.  Users/PhilipNeustrom
  In light of http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/politicalanimal/2012_01/putting_sopa_on_a_shelf034765.php recent events, we probably shouldnt do a blackout right now. The most useful blackout would be a message directing people to contact their congresscritters and tell them to oppose the bill. With the bill being dead in its current form, we might want save the blackout for when the bill is resurrected in some other form, but that wont be any time soon. Oh, and for what its worth, Mike Thompson, the local representative, opposes SOPA. Boxer and Feinstein support PIPA, though.  Users/WilliamLewis
