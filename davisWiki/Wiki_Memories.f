This may be too obscure, but looking at the slate names for Winter 2011 ASUCD Election/Nav the Winter 2011 ASUCD Election, it occurs to me that all it needs is an asshole from El Paso to run.

Strangely, problem areas in the wiki cycle in large waves.

  200?: ASUCD Slates
  200?: Dentists
  2010: Apartments
  2011: Taxi Services  (REALLY!??!)

  20xx: Doctor Wily?  Our Robotic Overlords?  Eloi?  GodQueen Suri?  Xiticix extermination services?  Unification war?  Flatcats?  Protein sources for Metamorphis?


 Return to Sender 

Okay, so Im trolling the news for stories involving Davis (not, not trolls that kind, wiki:wikipedia:Trolling (fishing) this kind).  I find a nice story about how PV Evolution Labs is opening a new testing facility in Davis.  Cool!  So, I start looking on the wiki for info.  Nothing.  Okay, lets look at the article... uhhh... http://www.earthtechling.com/2011/03/newcaliforniasolartestinglabsopen/ note the photo credit.  Well, its SOMEwhere on the wiki.


Wiki Classics
 Remember...?
  JeromeJohnson
  The furor over papasan chairs on the wiki?
  Hitler and Nazis becomes a legitimate topic of conversation on the IKEA entry.
  http://daviswiki.org/The_Make_Will_Not_Broke_Foundation?actiondiff&version212&version18 Greatest.  Edit.  Ever.  The fact that this just went multigenerational says more about the wiki being a real reflection of the community than anything else ever will.  The very real line of human life that we are all stepping through and weaving together is laid clear and real here.  Like an overheard comment while watering your lawn, or a chance chat with a neighbor while in line at the bank, this is the fingerprint of human experience  a moment of pure life  caught on the wiki.
  Graduate Tutorial Services LLC/Employment Graduate Tutorial Services  one guy posts the story of how he was annoyed during his interview, nothing happens for two weeks, and then a bunch of people start signing up and jumping all over him, mostly with new accounts, all within the span of a few hours.  Flashmob a la wiki?
  Bistro 33  A great example of how chaos became a useful entry.
  Real Computers  Not understanding the wiki.
  When Users/WilliamLewis not only tracked down a spammer, he found a webcam in their office!
  http://daviswiki.org/Stonegate_Village_Apartments?actionFiles&doview&targetSG%20poop.jpg Greatest image filename typo ever.
  The debate in mid 2010 over accusations of racism?  The community discussing the serious concerns of the ramifications of speech and identity.  Significantly more heavy topics than papasan chairs, but discussed with passion and (mostly) with respect.
  When the Crying Girl went viral... and then hit the media?
  The bizarre wiki snowball fight that resulted when anonpincher claimed that there was a wiki conspiracy against his revealing the Tandem conspiracy that he couldnt reveal for reasons of security?
  Taylor  who made adamant demands about content and edited the same content repeatedly, day after day, several times a day  http://daviswiki.org/Users/TaylorTorrence?actiondiff&version222&version121 chiding another person with the claim that they police Daviswiki.  An example of the common thread of people seeing everybody as bullies and themselves as victims when they are confronted with the fact that the people around them also have rights to edit the content and that real people working out disputes isnt easy nor universally satisfactory to all concerned.
  http://daviswiki.org/Users/upisdown?actiondiff&version212&version111 Greatest childish wiki sulk to date.
  http://daviswiki.org/Davis_ChamberPAC?actiondiff&version233&version132 This is a great edit, as it is unabashedly direct, not personally insulting, and it presents a pretty common point of view.
  Or, going for the personal and trivial, http://daviswiki.org/Northstar_Greenbelt?actiondiff&version26&version15 this edit captures an intimate part of Davis.  Awesome.
  Users/LourdesEBorrayo  One of the best introductions Ive seen on the wiki.  Neat life story.

   I was expecting something completely different.  I thought it said European White Bitch users/jimstewart
  I Hate Davis  in which the campus landscapers are called in utter and delicious ironic humor, the gender specific sexist bastards.


 We Hate Wiki Wars 

lyrics by Users/WesP
(To the tune of I Love Rock n Roll)
We saw the revisions and thought that they were mean
We tried to fix it up so that it was clean
We thought that it was wrong
But the trolls all just hang on
And we could tell the fight would be long
Til the trolls went away, away
And we could tell the fight would be long
Til the trolls went away, away... singin

We hate Wiki Wars
We all hate all of the stupid comments, baby
We hate Wiki Wars
So Come and take Wiki Chill Pill now
Oh

All the trolls laughed when we asked them for all their Realnames
It dont matter, they said
You should feel ashamed
Said “Leave this page alone”
Why dont you leave your homes
And we could tell the fight would be long
Til the trolls went away, away
And this has lasted oh so damn long
And the trolls are all here to stay, to stay.. singin

We hate Wiki Wars
We all hate all of the stupid comments, baby
We hate Wiki Wars
So Come and take Wiki Chill Pill now
