DavisWiki always can use more Free Community Advertising TableOfContents(right)

People looking to help out have a wide variety of resources available, although many (like stickers and fliers) need to be continually replenished.  Fliers can be printed with pocket change, and a group can get together and fund a sticker run.  Keep in mind that all aspects of the wiki need your help.

Resources for Outreach

  Davis Wiki PSA  weve got a public service announcement on KDVS.  You can edit the PSA on this page!
  Wiki Flyer  Also lots of targets for the fliers.
  Wiki Shirts  Make one and wear it with pride.
  Wiki Sticker
  Davis Wiki in one sentence
  Wiki Desktop Wallpaper  Put them computers where many people will see them.
  Wiki: Press Release Press Releases
  Opportunistic Wiki Advertising  satirical look at some more creative approaches
  A /sample letter sample letter thats good for passing out.
  A /Sample Posting sample posting for net outreach.


 Outreach Targets 

If the early adopters are already here how do we get a larger user base and more diverse representation of the community?  Lets list some potential audiences that could be approached:

  Chamber of Commerce/Downtown Business Association  but we need to be prepared for businesses discovering their reviews and disagreeing with them.
    They need to understand that this is a community resource and not the business resource.  This is why we should not market the wiki toward businesses themselves  smart business owners understand this, though.  Davis Wiki is already on http://www.davisdowntown.com/.
  Davis Senior Center, they have computer classes
  Schools, if we can clean up the language a bit  the wiki represents a great living textbook for many grade levels in understanding the community you live in and local history  also a great chance to teach and demonstrate information ethics.
  Townies in general!  The nonstudent population!

 2010 Advertising Drive 

 Fliering 

I think a new promotion drive is in order. I will be making some fliers using the following template:


Here are the prototypes. Going up today:



And inserting curiosityprovoking slogans such as the following:

Wait, theres a $1 movie night in Davis?
There were wild river otters living in Davis?
Where can I stable my horse?
What is cactus corners?
What is happening in town this week?
Theres an insect zoo in Davis? And its FREE?
Who found my dog?
Where are the 10 cleanest bathrooms in town? Why are there chickens all over the place?
Who is open after 10:00 p.m. in this town, anyway?
Theres a guy in town who makes personal hovercraft?
Theres a guy in town who makes a rocket car?
Who is selling cheap pints tonight?
Who is having a trivia night tonight?
Why does my tap water look like coca cola?
Where did they keep the radioactive dachshunds?


If there are any interesting tidbit type of facts the wiki provides about the town that would fit into a flier format, suggestions would be appreciated.

   The Know more than the locals one seems a bit insulting.  It also feels to me like it feeds the unfortunate stereotype that the Wiki is associated with UCD or is just for UCD students. jw
     Thats why they go to their target audience: UC Davis students and near student apartment housing. Given that theyre just coming back for spring semester, the timing is perfect. Ed

I just looked at the weather reports  I think Ill wait for the rain storms to pass before hanging any of these. Theyll just get wet.  Ed




20070405 00:02:53 nbsp I could table sometime at the farmers market.. we should get some computers out there though. Just because.  Users/DavidPoole
 20070405 05:23:00 nbsp Contact me, Id be up for it. If it was a combination demo with LUGOD, we could probably use the LUGOD demo machine. Users/NickSchmalenberger
  That might be pretty awesome, I do indeed also support linux. I would like to also throw support to the new wikispot.org deal as well, can we get anymore tech awareness into this deal? ~Users/DavidPoole

20080412 14:13:37 nbsp Does anyone man a booth at Picnic Day? What a way to reach out to the community and alumni of the university... Users/BrandonBarrette

   You have to sign up a while in advance.  As far as I know, people have suggested the idea but nobodys stepped up to followthrough with it.

      I figured it was too late, but its something to think about for next year... Maybe even possible to get donations for WikiSpot with all the alumni there. You know, provide methods for them to donate on the spot or via online link when they get home. Alumni like to open up their pockets if they see how it will benefit the community and university.

          Yeah, its a good idea.  Maybe someone could plan for WEF?  They are more lax about booths (nonmerch)

           We could register online, as an educational booth. http://wef.ucdavis.edu/component/option,com_facileforms/Itemid,70/ Anyone interested? I am willing to help man a booth. Users/BrandonBarrette

20080412 16:37:13 nbsp As a Wikivangelist, I would like to fulfill my duty by helping spread the gospel that is Davis Wiki.  In all seriousness, if we plan on tabling at an event or the Farmers Market or whatever, Im down to help out.  Just let me know.  Its great way to publicize Davis Wiki, but its also an opportunity to meet and chat with each other. Users/CurlyGirl26

20080412 17:17:21 nbsp Same here with the Farmers Market... I am there a lot anyways. Users/BrandonBarrette

20090515 09:24:56 nbsp How about encouraging businesses, musical acts, organizations, apartment complexes, course instructors, or anyone to mention their stuff as in as seen on DavisWiki!  If you like what you see, please leave a comment on DavisWiki.org... this might lead to biased reviews at first, but it would hopefully end up drawing a lot more people into the wiki and eventually getting them to add content on other wiki topics.  Even just a little sticker that says As seen on DavisWiki.org (inspired by the As Seen on TV things) might be popular. Users/TheAmazingLarry

20100113 11:28:57 nbsp Im thinking up some better curiosity provoking slogans for some new fliers Im designing. The fliers will follow the standard format of the one sentence flier (http://daviswiki.org/Wiki_Flyer?actionFiles&doview&targetoneSentenceFlyer.gif) but instead of slogans, they will contain questions that might provoke the curious to go to the site for details. A few I have thought up, off the top of my head:
Wait, theres a $1 movie night in Davis?
There were wild river otters living in Davis?
Where can I stable my horse?
What is cactus corners?
What is happening in town this week?
Theres an insect zoo in Davis? And its FREE?

Do yall think its time for another promotional campaign? Users/EdwardNiemand

20100113 13:04:57 nbsp Good ideas for poster/flyers!  Id recommend using a program like http://www.inkscape.org/ inkscape (very easy to use) along with the http://daviswiki.org/Wiki_Logo?actionFiles&doview&targetlogo.svg .svg or http://daviswiki.org/Wiki_Logo?actionFiles&doview&targetlogo.pdf .pdf files of the wiki logo. Users/PhilipNeustrom

    Ha, you noticed all I have is mspaint to make these fliers. Gawd it sucks. Took me 93875 hours to shoop it. Unfortunately, my copy of photoshop doesnt work with windows 7. What an unfortunate time to upgrade. Users/EdwardNiemand

20100113 16:02:55 nbsp Where are the 10 cleanest bathrooms in town?
Why are there chickens all over the place?
Who is open after 10:00 p.m. in this town, anyway?
Theres a guy in town who makes personal hovercraft?
Theres a guy in town who makes a rocket car?
Who is selling cheap pints tonight?

20100113 22:01:55 nbsp Nonvectorized logo looks craptastic, does nobody have an original? Users/KellyM

    Yeah, SVG, PDF, etc on wiki logo
