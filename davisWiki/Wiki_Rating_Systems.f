There is an inherent tendency in collaborative projects like the Front Page Wiki to rank and compare the objects of our compilation.  Not only is it fun to do this, but it can be very useful to other people who want to quickly learn from the community.  Without direction, several such rating systems have organically arisen.  This page is just a way to keep them straight and allow people to give a more detailed explanation of the meaning of the notation.  Please add to this list!  Currently this page just has examples of rating systems Ive seen on the Front Page Wiki.  Others probably exist, and others will surely be developed.


 Apartments 
Apartments Apartment complex ratings are concerned with a loose set of criteria that everyone is interested in when looking for where to live.  These are the things that you can find out through reputation alone, and not on the propertys website.  Things like the following:
  Noise level or partyability: from quiet/studious to animal house
  Maintenance reliability and response time: from Wake Forest Apartments Wake Forest flames to fast and meticulous.
  Shadiness Factor Shadiness factor of management or owners.  See below.

 Buffets 
For the thrifty individual, knowledge of how to transform ones small amount of cash into a massive amount of cooked food is invaluable.  Its sort of like how Jesus fed hundreds of people with one basket of bread and fish.  Perhaps Jesus should be credited with starting the first allyoucaneat buffet.  Messiahs aside, Buffets buffets are ranked from 1 to 9, with 5 being average and 9 being the best.  This rating system, which is based on food quality alone, was developed by the elusive Users/SteveDavison.

 Burritos 
Burritos are rated with a simple best to worst ranking: 1 to n, where n is the number of burritos listed on the page and lower numbers mean better burritoness (or burritosity).

 Pizza 
An attempt is being made to objectively quantify the most economical Pizza pizzas. The Functional Square Inch Calculation, (Pizza: FSI Calculations FSI), reflects how much of a pie is covered with toppings. Its not as much a rating as a quantification, but once enough evidence gets accumulated, we can start weighting it into a quantity per quality ratio.

 Shadiness Factor 
The Shadiness Factor Shadiness factor is a general purpose rating system.  Its hard to define, but everyone knows what it means.  Shadiness Factor is often applied to ASUCD, and EMOSNAIL often runs polls (usually weekly) on ASUCDs shadiness.

 Statistically Improbable Phrases 
Examples of just how unique our little DavisWiki really is.  This Statistically Improbable Phrases page is a collection (a measure, if you will) of how the content of the wiki differs from other webpages on the Internet.

 Walking Distance 
Although it may seem funny to rate things according to Walking Distance how far they are from you, this is the ultimate level of personalized and practical value.  To find out how a location in Davis rates, go to the Walking Distance walking distance page and find the point nearest you as well as the location you want to get to.  You can see how long it will take for you to get there and then calculate your opportunity cost accordingly.  This is a great page and you should contribute to it.
