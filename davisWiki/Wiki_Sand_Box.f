Did a former ASUCD senator get expelled for cow tipping?

 The above is a snazy way to hide an answer,
or make someone see a warning before highlighting the text to read it.   STD

Those comments stand because nobody else knows more. I cant correct it because for all I know, the proprietor actually says whenever Grandma is up when asked for her hours. If you know more about the store, please dont complain about the wrong information, simply correct it. Its clear that not many people know much (one of the two comments is Wish there was more info), so please add what you know. In the absence of any real information, poorly informed opinion will always fill the void... that has nothing to do with the wiki and is purely a function of human behavior. All you added in your comment was opinion, no expansion or additional information about the actual subject (other than the correction of the name, for which I thank you — Ive renamed the entry). —JabberWokky

The reviews you read here are worth what you paid to see them.

 map page testing 

Include(bulletin board test)bulletin board test map page

 Resident Garden 
 

Im trying to provide maps to different bulletin boards around town, and designed this this morning.  Not sure if it is the best way.  involves creating a new page for at least anything being mapped.  Still doesnt provide concise mappage of all the boards either.  Just declutterifies (im making up words now) the map and allows individual locations to be called out.  Any comments?
