Want to search Davis Wiki right from your browser?  There are a few options for you depending on the browser you use.

Firefox

Search Plugin

Have http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/ Firefox or http://www.mozilla.org/products/mozilla1.x/ Mozilla?
 Then you should firefoxsearch Image(screenshotexample.jpg, From Yahoo to Wiki!, right, thumbnail)

The plugin installs a little search bar to the side of the URL bar, allowing you to search and access the Wiki from any page. The search bar can be accessed by the mouse, CtrlK, or tab from the address bar. Search plugins can be selected using Ctrlup and Ctrldown or the mouse.

Want to search the UC Davis website in a similar fashion?
 Simply ucdavissearch

The Atmospheric Science Department has also released a search plugin for finding people in the UCD Directory, http://atm.ucdavis.edu/tools/UCDPeople.php available here.

Theres a toolbar available for download at http://www.davisol.com/toolbar, you will be able to search Davis Wiki, UC Davis Pages and UC Davis People from any page with either IE or Firefox/Mozilla


Manual Setup

If you dont want to install anything in your browser, Firefox will also allow you to set up a simple keyword for searching the DavisWiki using just your browsers location bar.  To do so, (1) just rightclick on the search box at the top of any DavisWiki page.  Then, (2) select Add a Keyword for this Search....  Then, (3) name the search DavisWiki (or whatever you want), choose a keyword (e.g. dwiki), and click Add.  Done.  Now you can search the DavisWiki using the location bar on your browser.  Just type your keyword (like dwiki), a space, and the terms you want to search for.


BookmarkletStyle Alternative

This is the wiki:Wikipedia:Bookmarklet that Users/EBT wrote and currently uses:

{{{
javascript:(function(){if(x%s){location.hrefhttp://daviswiki.org/?actionsearch&inline_string+escape(x)}else{location.hrefhttp://daviswiki.org/Recent_Changes}})();
}}}

Instructions:
 1. Create a new bookmark.
 2. Replace target URL with wiki:Wikipedia:JavaScript JavaScript code above.
 3. Give it a keyword, similar to the manual setup above. (recommended: dw)
 4. Now dw shark will search the wiki for sharks, and just dw will take you to Recent Changes!
 5. Enjoy your new life as a wiki:C2:RecentChangesJunkie recent changes junkie.


Google

This trick works in any browser.  You can simply put site:daviswiki.org in your search.  So to find all results for Best Pizza, type the following into Google:

{{{
best pizza site:daviswiki.org
}}}

...and youll find every place on the wiki referring to the best pizza in Davis.

Konqueror


Konqueror Web Shortcut for the Wiki Search: {{{
http://daviswiki.org/FrontPage?text_new\{@}&actioninlinesearch&button_new.x0&context40
}}}

Konqueror Web Shortcut for the Wiki: {{{
http://daviswiki.org/\{@}
}}}

Go to Settings, Configure Konqueror, Web Shortcuts and paste the above line and pick a shortcut.  I use dw.  Then you can use URLs like dw:Pizza to either jump directly to an entry or to search for the term.
