While youre welcome to create Homemade Wiki Shirts homemade Wiki Shirts, we are in the process of purchasing Wiki tshirts and sweatshirts to pay for Wiki Hosting. This will probably be an ongoing process.  We already made the first pass of shirts and well likely put out another run during our first big Wiki Spotrelated fundraiser. If you have better ideas, please submit those  ideally in the form of a computer graphic, even if its just a sketch.

 Other Options 

http://www.companycasuals.com/inkmonkey/start.jsp This link shows the various clothing and color options available from Ink Monkey.  Use this as the basis for any requests.

 Cost 

Currently were looking at a production cost of approximately $7 per tshirt and at least $20 per hoodie sweatshirt.  For this to generate any money for hosting, we need to receive ~$15$20 per tshirt and ~$30 per hoodie.

Well use a slidingscale price structure  just pay what you can manage (as long as its above cost) and keep in mind that the more money we collect the more hosting we can get.  All proceeds go to the Wiki  nobody (except the folks at Ink Monkey Graphics) will be compensated for this.

Ink Monkey gives us the best pricing (by far) when we buy 24 or more shirts at a time.  So, if only 4 or 5 people want (for example) a hat, each hat will cost more.  Also, Ink Monkey charges a $30 design fee when we first use a new design.  Thats not really a problem when were going through several dozen shirts, but getting a new design on a halfdozenitem run might be prohibitively expensive.

 Order Cycle 

The first (and most recent) order was for 25 white shirts of various sizes.  Users/GrahamFreeman placed this order with Ink Monkey Graphics on Thursday 8th Dec 05.  The order was ready for pickup on Tuesday 13th Dec 05  two days earlier than expected!  Hooray for Ink Monkey.

The next order cycle: unknown date / items.

 Shirt/Hoodie Requests 

If youd like to order a shirt or a hoodie with this design, please indicate below what kind (tshirt or hoodie), size, and quantity you want.  The initial order is for white shirts since thatll work best with this design, but future orders will include any other feasible colors (e.g. black, gray) and/or designs (be sure to upload an electronic image).

20051202 21:04:12 nbsp Funny, I was thinking about this yesterday. My idea: Have a 4color screen shot of the Wiki front page. This will communicate: Its a web page, give the URL, show what it looks like, etc. Actually I was thinking of this for 4x6 postcards. Users/SteveDavison

20051202 22:48:22 nbsp I want socks... Users/JoAnnaRich

20051203 21:21:30 nbsp When you get the shirt design finalized and start churning out shirts, let me know how people could order their own shirts to support the wiki. I could put an ad in the KDRT studio, you could send an ad to KDVS, and perhaps people who have shows on DCTV could be encouraged to sport the wiki shirt on their shows? Users/KarlMogel

20051206 16:47:31 nbsp When these see the light of day, Id love a small and a medium shirt.  Which reminds me, I need to go pick up my Wiki Sticker/Requests Wiki Sticker. Users/KevinChin

20051208 00:41:46 nbsp once you post the pricing, i recommend linking this page as a featured page, or at the very least adding something to the front page. im guessing there are plenty of people whod want a shirt that have never seen this page Users/CraigBrozinsky

20051208 10:09:32 nbsp I agree with the socks thing. Users/GiladGurantz

20051208 13:02:58 nbsp What about just a black shirt with the white logo on it? Id love that tshirt...but if that doesnt exist, then Id go for a small (if theyre adult sizes) shirt. )  Users/KarlaFung
  I agree, black shirt with the white logo and grey wiki symbol behind it, like the wiki logo on the top of the page, would be sweet. Users/MichelleAccurso

20051208 21:51:00 nbsp What color(s) are these shirts going to be? Users/MichelleAccurso
  The initial batch of shirts is white, but it looks like this batch will go quickly.  We can get other colours if they work with the designs we have.  If you have a suggestion for a colour/design combo, please provide an electronic graphic (similar in nature to the one above) that I can give to Ink Monkey. :) Users/GrahamFreeman

20051208 21:56:38 nbsp What about the socks?! A wiki logo on the side of it, maybe DavisWiki on the bottom like Hanes... Socks are sexy Users/JoAnnaRich

20051208 21:59:57 nbsp I havent pursued the sock idea yet. Youre welcome to check into it and report back, otherwise Ill check in to that as soon as I have the time. Users/GrahamFreeman

20051208 23:43:48 nbsp I spill food a lot can we go with anything darker? or maybe white lettering on black shirts? Users/CraigBrozinsky
  We can go with anything that someone provides me a workable electronic image for.  Use the image at the beginning of this page as a model.  Users/GrahamFreeman
   Hmm... how about I just ask for mine to go on a light gray shirt? Is that possible? Users/CraigBrozinsky
    Sure, in the next order.  The owner of Ink Monkey Graphics has been very patient with my persistent questions and I dont want to jerk his chain.  On the bright side, well probably go through these shirts very quickly, so the next order probably will come soon.  Users/GrahamFreeman
     I spilled food on my shirt the first day I wore it.  Oops!  Users/GrahamFreeman

20051208 23:44:10 nbsp I placed an order for 25 tshirts on Thursday.  We should receive them in about a week.  Ill place a hoodie order tomorrow (Friday) and if work isnt too crazy Ill ask about socks.. Users/GrahamFreeman

20051209 09:04:10 nbsp how about thongs and boxers? Users/DomenicSantangelo

20051209 09:52:17 nbsp I just have a question or 2 perhaps... What colours will be avaliable?   And would the colours be the same in the hoodie pullover version? Users/AndrewBanta

20051209 14:19:53 nbsp Shouldnt the back side of the arrow be pointing to the center of the circle? the arrows look weird to me. Users/ArlenAbraham
  Oh Arlen, you are so wrong. I kid I kid. It looks just like the wiki logo to me, what do you mean? Users/MichelleAccurso

20051210 16:01:02 nbsp What color will the hoodie be? Users/SimonFung
  Ive never seen a white hoodie in my life, so I hope its something black/blue.  Is black a safe bet? Users/PhilipNeustrom

20051210 17:41:48 nbsp Im sure both black and blue hoodies are available.  Do you think the current design would work on those colours?  Im not really a visually artistic person, so if someone would upload an image that would help a lot. Users/GrahamFreeman

20051213 22:31:42 nbsp Got an email today from Ink Monkey  the shirts are in!  Ill pick em up on Wednesday and will begin making arrangements to get everyone their shirts. Users/GrahamFreeman

20051214 08:49:18 nbsp I would like a small tshirt.  Users/AnnaJones

20051214 12:13:44 nbsp The shirts are here!  Ill coordinate with Philip in getting them out to people. Users/GrahamFreeman

20051214 12:20:19 nbsp How can you not post a photo modeling the shirt if you have them already? Users/MikeIvanov

20051214 14:45:02 nbsp I object to this shirt because I really dont Bike Circle Davis anymore, I only Bike Circle Davis Wiki. Users/TravisGrathwell
  It intentionally has two readings: I heart Davis and I wiki Davis.  You can just choose the latter.
    Sure Philip, if its convenient for you to pigeonhole abstract art and if it makes your world simpler to acknowledge only its most obvious facets, then sure, it has just two meanings.  Also, still no pics?

20051217 00:18:33 nbsp i love my shirt! Users/MichelleAccurso

20051218 09:46:43 nbsp I had what I thought to be a great idea this morning.  And that idea is that the next gen wiki shirts could be customizable with favorite links. Users/AndrewBanta

20051218 11:53:41 nbsp Can I get my shirt after the break? Users/SimonFung
  Yeah, totally

20051229 16:01:16 nbsp I really like the pink one. I think the ring around the neck is genious. Users/JohnDudek

20051229 17:12:22 nbsp Thanks. It might be difficult to pull off that effect in practice, and probably nearly impossible to make the arrows go all the way around to the back seamlessly. Users/MikeIvanov
  Why is that shirt pink?
  Image(iiam.gif, noborder)
    You kids these days have it so easy with your storebought pink shirts.  Why, in my day, we had to mix our clothing up in the washer to get a pink shirt!  And we had to walk backward, uphill, naked in the snow both ways to get to the washing machine!

20060120 14:20:24 nbsp If you place an order for a ladies cut shirt Ill be in to purchasing one, but Ill wait until there are enough interested parties to make a good deal.  Preference for the Wiki logo design. Users/SharonRuth

20060131  Im having Users/ArlenAbraham take over the shirt distribution/etc as Im far too busy to do this properly myself.  So, if I never got back to you, email arlen.abraham at gmail dot com and hell take care of you. Users/PhilipNeustrom

20060330 12:48:14 nbsp Someone tell me when we get the black design settled (hoodie OR Tshirt) ... Users/TusharRawat

20060410 23:02:35 nbsp Just a reminder:  Ill happily front the money for another order (black tshirts, and/or hoodies) as soon as Ive been repaid for the cost of the last tshirt order. Users/GrahamFreeman

20060410 23:07:45 nbsp Damn! I cant do anything about that! Users/TusharRawat

20060416 22:44:16 nbsp Far too many larges were ordered and we seem to have a buttload of large/medium shirts left.  If youre a large/medium and want a shirt, please let us know so we can recoup our costs and move on to the next order.  If you can volunteer to table in the MU or Farmers Market and sell shirts/donations, please comment, too. Users/PhilipNeustrom
  I wear a large, and I would table too if i got a free shirt out of it. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20060417 00:40:13 nbsp I am SO ready to advertise my love for Daviswiki. Nerds, watch out! Users/EliseKane

20060728 10:20:38 nbsp I like the mouse and French designs. Could the artist post a pdf of those somewhere so we can make silkscreens? Users/AlphaDog

20060927 23:32:08 nbsp are there any shirts left? Users/DavidHolcomb

20080519 22:01:17 nbsp I totally want some shirts but cant decide which ones.  Also,  you guys need to make hats.  Thatd be rad. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080519 22:46:32 nbsp I would like to order a medium Davis Wiki tshirt.  Are there any left? Users/CurlyGirl26

20080520 02:31:39 nbsp I want NPOV, WE DONT NEED NO STINKIN NPOV

or at least thats what Im going to do with my TOW shirt Users/StevenDaubert
