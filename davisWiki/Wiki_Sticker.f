Eris smiled upon me today and randomly made me $23 richer. Since the amount of currency that fell into my lap was such an wiki:wikipedia:Law of fives auspicious quantity, I decided it was only proper to consult my pineal gland. Also sprach meine Zirbeldr√ºse: Hey, youve been in this town for three years and you still havent gotten a wiki sticker. Perhaps you should have some made? So I go to check out the http://www.123stickers.com/index.asp?PageActionVIEWCATS&Category202 website for the sticker people. 250 stickers could be had for merely $23! Coincidence? I think not. Anyway, since its my money, Im going to get http://daviswiki.org/Wiki_Sticker/StickiWiki_Design_Contest?sendfiletrue&fileoriginalishinverted.png one of my designs printed up. If anyone wants to get more (chunks of 250 cost $23) so we can evangelize more freshmen, drop me a line. Ill fulfill any remaining Wiki Sticker/Requests with my chunk. Users/WilliamLewis

In order to get our name out even more, we propose printing an attractive sticker that can be put in windows of businesses, cars, homes.  With the funds raised so far through Donate donations, we should be able to afford a reasonable amount of quality stickers in the near future (note: stickers are dangerously cheap  about $20 for 200)

For ideas and graphics material, check out Wiki Flyer. Also see Where is your Wiki sticker.

Would you like to design the Davis Wiki sticker? Please post your suggestions and design ideas below!

  I think small to medium clear vinyl stickers would be best.  That way they can go into windows without becoming an eyesore.

 An initial wiki sticker 

500 prototype wiki stickers were created.  The sticker is a blackonwhite vinyl design.  The design is the very obvious wiki logo with the url underneath.  Some stickers were dropped off (081705) at Cafe Roma by campus.

If you want one of these, add your name to Wiki Sticker/Requests and ninjas will come to your home while you sleep and drop off a sticker.  Or flip out and kill you.  Whatever.
