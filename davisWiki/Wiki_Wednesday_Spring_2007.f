ALL WIKI COMMUNITY MEMBERS WELCOME
It is our honor to invite all of you who have contributed to this site in the interest of public discourse to our Wiki Wednesday party next week. Our Owner, Matt Haines, Regional Manager, Dan DOrazio, and Marketing Manager, Joshua Vigil will be in attendance to thank you all for contributing to the establishment of Bistro 33 as a part of the Davis landscape and as a Daviswiki phenomenon.

We would like to invite you all to see the positive changes we are making at Bistro 33 and to hear about our plans for the future. Our goal is always to improve and always to take care of our guests; give us the opportunity to reaffirm that to you.

Personally, Id like to put faces to some of the empassioned voices who are a part of the Wiki community (positive, negative, and inbetween). Even though I may not always agree with what is written, I admire and respect the format of the Daviswiki and continually marvel at the impact it has on the community as a whole. I applaud all of you who take part in this truly interactive environment. There are so many of you who have contributed; all of you have made a difference in how I view Bistro and the plans we make for its growth and success. From JarrettNoble to HughToppe, JeffSpeckles to LisaBeth, CraigBrozinsky to JessicaFu, and everyone in between; I sincerely look forward to meeting you!

GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHOW OUR THANKS! XJOIN US NEXT WEEK FOR WIKI WEDNESDAY!X (note that this refers to a past event)

Shannin and the folks from Bistro 33 welcomed a small group of people from Davis Wiki to a very nice discussion about both the wiki and Bistro 33. This was the first non potluck Wiki Gatherings Wiki Gathering. Conversations touched on Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner business owners or managers can have a mutually beneficial relationship with the wiki to the history of Historic City Hall old City Hall.




Shannin shared a lot of her philosophy toward customer service and the wiki folks shared information about the April 2007 Wiki Update recent developments with http://wikispot.org and its relationship to daviswiki. As with any Wiki Gatherings Wiki gathering the process of putting faces with user names took a while, but helps everyone involved to better understand who else is involved in this cooperative effort on the wiki.




Users/JabberWokky was in attendance if only by instant messaging and was able to answer some critical questions as the evening turned on and the topics drifted from Pennyfarthing to the vulcanization process for rubber.
