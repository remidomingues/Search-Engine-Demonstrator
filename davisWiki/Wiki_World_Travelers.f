  Where in the world have you been? 

Whether its visiting family somewhere far away, relaxing and vacationing, or enjoying a backpacking trip far and wide, many Wiki travelers have been to some interesting places throughout their lives.

  Davis can seem to shorten horizons, in the spirit of busting out, herewith some inspiration: Song Of the Open Road by Walt Whitman WilyFerret
    {{{Afoot and lighthearted I take to the open road,
    Healthy, free, the world before me,
    The long brown path before me leading wherever I choose.
    Henceforth I ask not goodfortune, I myself am goodfortune,
    Henceforth I whimper no more, postpone no more, need
    nothing,
    Done with indoor complaints, libraries, querulous criticisms,
    Strong and content, I travel the open road.
    The earth, that is sufficient
    ...
    You road I enter upon and look around, I believe you
    are not all that is here,
    I believe that much unseen is also here.
    Here the profound lesson of reception, nor preference nor
    denial.
    ...
    You air that serves me with breath to speak!
    You objects that call from diffusion my meanings and give
    them shape!
    You light that wraps me and all things in delicate equable
    showers!
    You paths worn in the irregular hollows by the roadsides!
    I believe you are latent with unseen existences, you are so dear
    to me...
    From the living and the dead you have peopled your impassive
    surfaces, and the spirits thereof would be evident and
    amicable with me...
        }}}
