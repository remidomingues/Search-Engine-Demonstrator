20100122 14:38:58 nbsp Hi, I know there is a way to archive old comments on my page, can we archive everything from last year please?  Our page is Cambridge House.  Thank you Users/Cambridge

20100201 08:23:33 nbsp This would be a good page to put some suggestions about what to do if you want to help improve/maintain the wiki.  Users/RealComputers
  Have a look at the To Do list... is that the sort of thing you had in mind? Users/TomGarberson
      actually yes. Thank you.  Brian

20100322 16:39:58 nbsp I found a link to the official City of Davis page to one of the upcoming event on March 25, how do I add the link to the event page? When I click edit it said I cant edit the event from the edit page, but I only see the form where you actually post a new event.  Users/LeeY

20100402 11:27:19 nbsp Why doesnt Lauren Vaage Construction result as a Title match when construction is searched on the Davis Wiki? And can I get it to result earlier in the Full text match list its on the 7th next 10 matches page when remodel is searched (even though its not in the title)? Also, is it OK to use the Photo Request macro on a page such as the EC Garden, even though there are photos, but we always need new ones? Users/TimQuick

   It does show up, but you have to press next  its in the next set of results.  As far as moving it around in the results, not sure about that  probably a bad idea to fool with.  Most will end up on construction page after searching.

         Yes, but its on the 7th next page, and the word construction is in the title; so shouldnt Lauren Vaage Construction come up on the Title matches when construction is searched? I dont mean to be demanding, but I need understanding here to be better at Wiki  thanks to all of you who have helped, are helping, and will help me.
           The most important thing to understand is that this is not a commercial site like Google, where businesses pay for (or otherwise try to get) top billing.  This is a community resource, created by volunteers in the community, for the community.  So, I suspect that is why no one is concerned where your business (or any other business) comes up in the search page.  As someone else mentioned, the most important thing for someone using the wiki is that the Construction page comes up, so they can find the various construction businesses in the Davis area if they are in need of one.   Users/CovertProfessor
            Yes, I fully understand and appreciate the noncommercial nature of the Wiki, and I am not trying to sway the results of searches in favor of any business (that would be totally inappropriate in this setting). But I am trying to understand why this title does not result when the key word, that is in the title, is searched  a technical question. Is it a sideeffect of the redirect?
             Well, the software only shows ten matches at a time.  It doesnt show up in the first ten matches, but it does show up in the next 10 matches.  There are a lot of pages with construction in the title.  (21, to be exact).  cp
              Ohhh, somehow I only saw the next 10 matches link under the Full text matches, and not under the Title matches  thank you Users/CovertProfessor for bearing with me on this now embarrassing string.  Umm, another question: Is there a way to have Wiki randomly display Title match results? and in addition, how does Wiki decide which results to list in the first 10 Title matches? I must admit that Im biased towards pages I tinker with, but Im not looking for any unfair advantage or anything, just curious about the workings and how the Wiki can best be utilized (correctly, not in a Yelpy or Googlish way). Users/TimQuick
              You could always either help out with the coding or if you cant do that you could help out by donating to the wiki in other ways. I know that Philip is working on a redesign of the software that Davis Wiki runs on. Maybe you could help out in some way. My guess however is that there is more value in trying to present the most likely answers to a given question and that process isnt likely to result in random results. Users/JasonAller
              Im not too good with the coding, but do have a donation in the works. Would be glad to help in some other way too. Thanks to everyone whos been helping me navigate the world of Wiki! Users/TimQuick

   I think its okay to use the photo request macro!  Users/PhilipNeustrom

         Thanks PhilipNeustrom.

   Usually I add a little note after the Photo Request what I think there should be a photo of (if the photo is so old it no longer looks like the subject, etc).  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

         OK, thanks JabberWokky.

20100627 14:34:10 nbsp Hi Wiki,
   Over a year ago, someone created a page called Boogie Woogie Baby for a class was at my studio, Mojo Flow Studio.  The class didnt work out and was shortly canceled.  Anyway, the wiki page is still here.   It doesnt serve any useful purpose or contain any useful information. Is there a way I can delete it?  The same situation applies to  Dance Baby Dance,  although this page was started by another person, and the situation there is a little different.  But as a general issue, as the Davis wiki becomes bigger and more successful it will eventually need a mechanism through which detritus can be removed.  Is there any established procedure by which a page that has been created but never used by anybody would disappear?

Thanks,  Chris Users/crpike

20100724 09:13:43 nbsp Sometimes, new editors (http://wikispot.org/Users/maritovar this one, for example) create a wikispot user name when they probably mean to create a Davis Wiki one.  Which user page will they see when they log in?  Is there a way for mere mortals to move them over to Davis Wiki?  If not, what should we do when we see such cases? Users/CovertProfessor

20100901 18:57:13 nbsp Hey friends need help on http://www.scruzwiki.org/Bank_of_the_West Bank of The West its making the City category jack all the way out when all the extra space isnt needed. Any ideas please? Users/PeterBoulay
  Its using the width of the widest of the first columns to place the second and third columns (think of it as a table with columns and rows, which is what it really is).  My suggestion would be to put the Notes stuff in the main body of the page.  I prefer the initial table short and sweet, anyway.   Users/CovertProfessor

20110324 12:52:06 nbsp I found a review that use to be on the main page for Cambridge House moved to my private messages.  Can we switch that back somehow?  Also, I was trying to update info and the page is saying I am not allowed to update the page.  Why is that?  Thanks! Users/Cambridge
  Hi, Im Jason. What is your name? Users/JasonAller

20110514 05:55:52 nbsp how do I post a new homeschool option under the schools section?? Users/dashabyers

20110517 10:09:34 nbsp Hi, I own a local business, pilates flow.  Im changing the second half of the name
flow.  Do need to start an entirely new wiki page, or can I take my existing one and change the second half of the name?  Thanks you. Users/crpike

20110610 15:17:33 nbsp Hello, I put up a Davis Wiki page a few years ago: Matthews Home Repair, but I dont work construction any more. Despite the flag at the top of that page, I still get calls looking for a handyman. Is there any way to remove that page altogether? It would save me some unneccesary phone calls. Thanks! Matt S. Users/Wehttam
 Matt  Ive added the Departed Business header, changed the description to past tense, struck out the phone number, and removed the page from the Home Improvement and Repair list.  Have a look: Matthews Home Repair.  The Wiki is pretty big on preserving historical information, so pages generally dont deleted altogether.  This should hopefully take care of the problem.  If it doesnt, post back and we can remove the number entirely. Users/TomGarberson

20110804 10:00:38 nbsp Is there a way to arrange comments from the most recent to older. Currently the comments are arranged with the older ones on top and the more recent ones at the bottom. Any information is appreciated. Users/ThePrinter
 No.  Users/WilliamLewis
 The way the Comment bar works is that it just inserts whatever text someone puts in at the very end of the page.  Not something that can be adjusted at all in this version of the software.  Therell be new software coming down the pipeline at some point in the future, so who knows.  That may change.  Users/TomGarberson

20110807 22:51:26 nbsp Hi,
I was wondering if there was anyway for me to change the username to my current account? Users/kkha91
  I am pretty sure that there isnt.  What you can do is close your current account and open up a new one.  To do this, click settings in the upper right hand corner, change your email address from username@host to username+disabled@host and then press Save. Then scroll down to the bottom and use the Disable Forever option. That will allow you to use the same email address to signup again under your desired username.   Users/CovertProfessor

20111017 08:51:29 nbsp Hi, how do I link a Davis page to a page in other local Wikis, like Woodland and Winters.  Thanks! Users/JustinLowenthal
  Like this:  {{{wiki:woodland:Name of Page}}} or {{{wiki:winters:Name of Page}}}.   Users/CovertProfessor

20111118 20:06:32 nbsp I dont know if this is the right place to write about this, but I just updated the pictures on the Amtrak page, and for some reason their widths are uneven as seen in my browser, even though they all have the same thumbnail width value. (I added photos of the RR fence to that page, so the photo of the train seemed better suited to put on the Amtrak page. Thats why I edited the Amtrak page photo layout. However, to do that I had to save it to my local computer, then upload it again, as the filename wasnt recognized when I simply specified that used in the code of the other page.) Users/RussellReagan

20120112 18:37:31 nbsp Any users here a mechanic? Just wondering if anybody is willing to start a car questions page. You could be just like Tom and Ray, but local! Users/MeggoWaffle
  Ooh, neat idea!   Users/CovertProfessor
  I love the idea.   At first it sounds odd that it would exist before a bike questions page (or does one already exist? My memory nags me that it does), but bike information sources and resources are all over Davis already. jw

20120322 08:23:43 nbsp Can someone add a comments box to my page? girgonegreen skincare. Thanks so much! Users/jwendt
  Ok, done!   Users/CovertProfessor

20120505 09:38:21 nbsp I cant find the page with the macro for comments with the same ip address.  Help :( Users/LoriOrf
The answer, courtesy of Tom, is Includes


20120827 17:26:39 nbsp How do I change the name of my business page after I have created the page?  I hit the edit button on the page, but that doesnt seem to allow me to edit the actual name of the page.  It just allows me to edit the text on the page.  Thank you! Users/TerriLeonard

20120827 17:38:25 nbsp Terri you click Edit and click Rename at the bottom page. Itll ask you for a new page name and then itll switch it over. Users/PeteB

20120905 12:18:41 nbsp I am wondering if you can help me publish a front page, Wikiwide announcement for help. A fellow Davis resident, and father of two young children, was just diagnosed with a rare type of leukemia. He will have a hard and long road ahead to recover. He will spend the next 4 weeks in the hospital. When he comes home, it is crucial that he has a clean environment. The family has two indoor, very loving and sweet cats. They are heartbroken that they have to give them up. I am helping my neighbor find a new and welcoming home for their cats ASAP. Can you please publish a headline that if anyone is interested, to please email me at jgroveman@gmail.com. Please.
One cat is a siamese mix white cat with blue eyes. The other is a russian blue cat with green eyes. Both are 7 years old.  Users/jgroveman
  Very sad situation.  :(  A suggestion: Have you thought about posting to Freecycle?  They are set up for giving away things for free, including animals.   Users/CovertProfessor

20120905 13:49:07 nbsp I dont want these cats treated like used junk on freecycle. These were loved cats being let go under only the saddest of situations. No win situation. So obviously we want to help them find a home in Davis with responsible, caring people. Maybe another family with young kids. Also to minimize it being traumatic for the cats too. Can you please post something short term in a visible place. please.  Users/jgroveman
   Have you tried Craigslist?  I recently had to find a home for a relatives seven year old dog after she became incapacitated and unable to care for him.  I posted an ad on Craigslist and found a loving and safe home for him within a few hours after posting. Lori

20120905 14:38:07 nbsp Due to the extreme, unforeseen and sad issues this family is facing, you guys cannot post something to this wiki? This is an excellent source for getting the word out. It is also a more professional outlet than craigslist or freecycle.  Users/jgroveman

20130110 16:43:55 nbsp Im trying to delete an image that has double quotes in the name.  ( http://daviswiki.org/Lost_Pets?actionFiles&doview&target%22fake%20name%20FIONA%22.jpg picture with quotes in the name )  Unfortunately, doing so gives a python traceback.  Can someone with lowerlevel access to the database remove this picture, please?   Users/gcoville

Heres the error:
{{{ Traceback (most recent call last):

   That and a couple others are vexing.  If its really critical, I can do it, but its probably better to just leave it there than go poking in the database. jw
    Okay, thats fine.  Its not hurting anything except my Attention to Detail :) Users/gcoville

20130218 22:38:31 nbsp If we link to an image file, it gives the appearance of being embedded into the page. Since we are technically not hosting the content, is this a way around being liable for copyright infringement? The reason why I ask is that there are some really great Davis memes floating around out there, but they almost all use copyrighted characters at their foundation. There currently seems to be no way of making thumbnails of such images of such images, but its such a shame if the most popular memes cant be found on our site, yet can be found on several others.

Shows like John Stewarts use random clips and images all the time (I presume without permission as the basis of their show). Isnt there such a thing as fair use, or is that just wishful thinking? Adding these sorts of image would greatly enliven the wiki and add even more  personality and humor. Users/ScottMeehleib
   I see three issues even after straight copyright considerations: Dilution, where the content becomes less free to use.  Notification, where a nonCC image accidentally becomes assumed to be so due to the notice being lost (aka accidental copyright violation).  Nonprofit, where more ads go in because I have copyright, but I am letting the wiki use these photos of my hair styles, to the point of commercial use, and the IRS whacks our peepeeFootnote(Or a bailiff.  And if you dont get this, you need to listen to more 60s comedy albums.).  They are all somewhat related.  I think its mostly a be careful not to start an avalanche when you add one situation. jw

20130325 08:40:14 nbsp I accidentally deleted my whole wiki site!! ARRGGHHH I meant to delete a comment that was irrelevant, about a stylist who only worked for us for 2 months, and when I put that in the comment field, it deleted my whole site!! HELP!!! Users/HeatherWatne

 Heather did you have a wiki spot wiki, or were you editing an entry on the Davis wiki? ~SD
    It was an entry, and I think David restored it (I could be wrong on who... no offense intended if Im crediting the wrong person!).  jw

20130717 14:26:40 nbsp Hi I have a couple questions regarding the Fithouse wiki page.

Can you help us delete both pages we have open? We need a fresh start. Thanks! Users/AlecMiramontes
