Oh I know Ive used the wrong mark up in AIM and on LJ, Users/BrentLaabs Brent even called Philip and told him to develop a plugin of sorts to link wiki links in IM conversations. And Users/AndrewBanta weve been known to yell out wiki mark up in obscene fashion. ie; BRACKET, QUOTES, BITCH! Users/MichelleAccurso
  I sometimes worry that Im becoming a wiki supremacist. Users/BrentLaabs


 Thursday, April 8, 2006 My husband and I wanted something easy and inexpensive to eat, but couldnt think of where to go.  We asked Where Should I Eat Today and it replied Ali Baba.  We had never been there before an figured we best not argue with the WikiBot.  It was a perfect choice! ~Users/JanelleAlvstadMattson Janelle
