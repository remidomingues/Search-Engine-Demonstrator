What does Wikiholics Anonymous mean to you?
1. We admitted we were powerless over Wiki  that our lives had become unmanageable. ...

  According to Users/RobRoy:  Wikiholics Anonymous is a group of people that are unable to step away from the Wiki for longer than a day, without even thinking about the Wiki. Wiki Anonymous members lead average day to day lives. They hang out at coffee shops on occasion and only drink tea, but always tip three hundred percent. They enjoy walking purple puppy dogs on the moon. They never smoke cigarettes, drink any alcohol, or eat anything with citrus. They dont cast shadows except for at high noon. They type with all eleven fingers but only type six words a minute. They are illiterate. They hate circles so when they go to their meetings (and the average member goes to meetings at least seven times a day) they form rectangles, but sometimes they form squares. They place their hands in their neighbors rectum and say, My name is (_ _ _ _) and I am a Wikiholic. Oh yeah, and all Wikiholics Anonymous members are to be shot on site upon entering the Davis city of Davis.

  According to Users/DanMasiel: In one of the only just applications of the Patriot Act that I have ever seen, federal agents recently apprehended servel militants that are suspected of being members of the splinter group Martyrs of the Wikiholic Jihad. Appearantly they were driving an explosives laden Unitrans bus north on Anderson when they were stopped by police. The explosives were detonated causing blackouts throughout Davis, for most of the evening. No one was harmed as the bombers appearantly got cold feet about their suicide mission, fleeing the bus at the last possible moment. The Davis Police Department DPD released a statement describing the suspects as a couple o wussies from the UCD LiveJournal community. It is widely suspected that memebers of MWJ have infiltrated various other ASUCD related groups. And rumors are circulating wildly that up to half of the members of the Student Focus slate and even several members SOSSS are in fact agents of MWJ.

  According to Users/PhilipNeustrom: It means never having to say youre sorry.

  According to Users/GeoffJohnson: It means enviously staring at Users/ArlenAbrahams statistics at 3 AM when youve got homework to do.

  According to Users/PaulHarms: It means power. Raw power. Thats really all Im in it for.  Power.
