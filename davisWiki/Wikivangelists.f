So to all of those lost and bored souls, I say believe in the power of the Wiki, and bask in Its knowledge.  Users/BrentLaabs

20070625 19:08:38 nbsp Summer advising is coming up soon and Im wondering if there is anything we can do to promote the wiki there. Assuming the university will let us, anyone up for tabling? Users/WilliamLewis

    We need a printable design for a sticker!!  I think that Steve Lamberts handout design would be cool to hand out at summer advising.  See the design on the Wiki Flyer page under Brainstorming.  We need a printready version of it and someone willing to take the initiative to getting it printed.  The funds can be supplied, though.  Users/PhilipNeustrom
     Ive sent off an email to the orientation people asking what we need to do to make this work. Users/KarinaSummers already said shed help out and Im looking for others. Im not gonna be able to do all 20 or so orientations on my own. I would be willing to have stuff printed, but Id need the money up front as I dont have much of my own money at this point in time. Users/WilliamLewis wl
          Email me your phone number and Ill meet up with you sometime this week and give you mad cash.  Youre in town? Users/PhilipNeustrom
         You have to be a registered SPAC group to table at summer advising. I tabled for ASUCD the past two years and gave out a lot of davisiwki stickers at the ASUCD table. So you might want to drop some off at the  table. I believe Kareem will be speaking at most of them. Users/JamesSchwab
          If thats true, Ill register a DavisWiki club. Who wants to be an officer? wl

Tabling is off the table. I got this email today.

 William,

 Unfortunately you may not table as the deadline to register a table is way
 past and I am not sure what your exact affiliation is with the campus.  We
 only allow the governing departments table (for example, individual club
 sports cant table but Campus Rec who oversees them can that way everyone
 is equally represented rather than just a few clubs.  However, many of our
 Orientation staff promote your Web site in their sessions with the
 students.  Also, I suggest tabling during Fall Welcome, register to table
 at the downtown event at htt://fallwelcome.ucdavis.edu

20080817 01:55:09 nbsp Please advertise this website at the incoming freshmen orientation. I was so disappointed that this site wasnt discussed at my orientation. It seems like such a valuable community resource. Users/ThanhVu
 20080817 13:50:06 nbsp Thats a good idea.  Can we get in on that?  How do we do this?   Users/CurlyGirl26
  The simple answer is that we cant. Student affairs is filled with bureaucratic stiffs who make and blindly enforce poorly thought out policy. In order to promote the wiki to residents of student housing, we either need to be a SPAC registered groupfootnote(Unacceptable because SPAC groups have to be student groups with student leadership. The idea of leadership is contrary to the idea of the wiki. Also, we are a community project, not soley a student project.) or we need to be affiliated with a unit of the university. I know, its sad. Users/WilliamLewis

20080817 14:22:44 nbsp Bummer.  Are there other events that we could possibly table?  When I was a student, they used to have days where lots of organizations (not just student groups) would be out on the quad offering information about their services.  Maybe we could do something like that instead.  Yea, I used to work for UCD. They are notorious for bogus policies. Users/CurlyGirl26
  Yes.  There is tabling at the Farmers Market... see my comment to Users/ThanhVu.  Theres also a very easy way around everything to be able to get into UC Davis as an official student organization.  I wrote it up awhile back and theres a lengthy comment somewhere, but essentially: having a student group devoted to the wiki does not mean that the wiki has to be a student group.  There is a Red Cross student group and a Democratic Party student group that are composed of students  and in no way mean that either the American Red Cross or the United States Democratic Party are student organizations.  It just means that they have a student group on campus that works to support their aims and ideals among the student body.  In the same way, a group can do so on campus.  Many official student organizations are student arms of nonstudent organizations in the greater world. Theres no reason that a UC Davis student has to be head of the American Red Cross just so that there can be a Red Cross club on campus.  And unless Howard Dean (the current head of the Democratic Party) is registered as a student, according to Williams logic (and hes not alone), the Davis College Democrats is unable to be an official club.  The Davis Wiki itself does not require student leadership to be a SPAC registered organization  just the Davis Wiki Student Club.  Now, organizing the club with leadership for the minimal SPAC requirements to operate seems fine to me  the wiki itself has a Board of Directors for the minimum legal requirements to keep operating: to take in donations and pay bills.  Its not ideal, but it is the practical solution to deal with the requirements imposed by outside law... or in this case, by SPAC. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
   Its not that simple. Ive talked to people at Student Affairs about this. Creating a club solely to promote DavisWiki, something entirely independent of the university, wouldnt be enough to get a table. We would only be allowed to promote our club, not a thirdparty organization. Users/WilliamLewis
      And that would be fine.  The Davis College Democrats push their club  the purpose of which is promoting and supporting the Democratic Party.  The UCD Davis Wiki Club could do the same to promote something that they believe in.  I see very little difference between the Davis Wiki and the Red Cross in this circumstance, and there is a Red Cross club on campus.  Holding some physical meetings to assist people with markup and questions about how the wiki works  i.e., helping new editors and each other... well, that sounds like a pretty good idea to me, and is pretty much directly in line with what the other various student groups do. Teaching markup and cooperative editing versus teaching CPR.... getting the word out about how people can help their neighbors through the wiki versus getting the word out about blood drives.  Honestly, the Red Cross is a pretty good example of a Davis Wikilike group because they are also focused on helping communities in specific ways.  The Davis Wiki is also about helping the Davis community  in the specific ways of connecting and documenting the community.Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
        To paraphrase one of the people I spoke to about this, Dont do it, it wont work. If someone wants to pursue this, theyre welcome to try, but it is an exercise in futility. wl

20080820 11:31:45 nbsp This looks like the perfect event if youre looking to advertise Davis Wiki on campus: http://spac.ucdavis.edu/programs/af/. The event is designed for student organizations. Get a few students together to organize the Davis Wiki Club on campus and register it with SPAC, and then that club can advertise with its own table at the Activities Fair in October. I do not think this is an exercise in futility. The club could be a student organization dedicated to UC Davis students improving a community resource, Davis Wiki. If anyone is serious about doing this, and I will bet a large amount of money that it CAN be done, you should also look into fallwelcome.ucdavis.edu.
