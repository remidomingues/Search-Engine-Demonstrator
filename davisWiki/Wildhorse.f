20060529 23:43:15 nbsp According to someone I was speaking with at Farmers Market, when the neighborhood was built all of the advertised affordable housing was sold to blood relatives of the developers and then resold at market rate value. I am trying to substantiate this. Does anyone else know? Users/RobRoy

    Without any other information from other sources, I would not give that story any credit at all. There are a lot of people who dont like any developments in Davis and will say crazy things. This is because, claiming that they like the nonexistent small town feel, they really dont want their own property values reduced or they have been brainwashed by such property owners. The only real way to stop development is to start handing out contraception. Users/NickSchmalenberger

    Im trying to do some research on this.  It seems there was considerable controversy regarding 4 affordable housing sales that were then resold at market value two years after their purchase.  The homes were sold at rates from $140,000 to $143,000.  The home owners followed all relevant laws and repaid their $15,954 in city affordable housing loans.  One homeowner had reportedly owned another house in a different location in Davis.  The incident caused debate about the affordable housing policys merits.   sources: Davis Enterprise: Davis will investigate affordable home sales (2002802) and 2002731 Davis Enterprise: Affordable housing questioned (2002731)  Its possible some of these people were relatives of the developers but I cant find any information indicating this in the Enterprises archives.  There is a hint, however, that something was amuck: Developers are not required to meet a set of standards for choosing who is awarded the homes.  Lets try and do some more research and integrate these comments in a bit.  In particular, the Enterprise may not have all the details.  Old Aggies might provide some more information, but they are not searchable on the net so someone will have to take a trip to Sheilds.  Users/PhilipNeustrom

   According to this: http://www.cityofdavis.org/housing/pdfs/AMBAG_presentation.pdf there were 52 forsale affordable houses in wildhorse, so four doesnt seem like a very big deal. Lots of people sell houses after only living in them for two or three years and it seems likely to me that many of the 52 would have been sold even if they werent originally affordable given that the real estate market has been high.
