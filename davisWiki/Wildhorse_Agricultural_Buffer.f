The Wildhorse Agricultural Buffer is protected Open Space open space between the Wildhorse development in northeast Davis and adjacent Yolo County farmland. Most of the buffers acreage borders the Wildhorse Golf Club. You can see lots of ground squirrels, owls, and Rabbits bunnies here. This is a good Places to Walk or Run place to walk or run, providing that you stay on the gravel path. You can enter the path just north of East Covell Boulevard, east of the Wildhorse subdivision. The horse ranch property on the left as you enter the buffer is located on the site of the illfated Wildhorse Ranch planned development project, which was rejected by voters threetoone (under Measure J) in November 2009.
