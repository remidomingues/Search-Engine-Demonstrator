The Wildhorse Condominiums feature individually owned and propertycompanymanaged condos. It was built in 2006, so it is one of the newer housing areas in Davis. It is also one of the furthest complexes from the UC Davis campus. Luxury comes with a price: distance. Every unit has a garage in addition to regular amenities like washer and dryer, dishwasher, garbage disposal, fridge, and central heat and air. Second story units have a deck while first floor units have a small, unenclosed patio area. There is also a pool and a spa, but sadly the management does not heat the spa.

The complex is generally quiet because it is populated by a mix of families, young professionals, and college students. Units on Moore Blvd. have a great view of Nugget Fields and are well within earshot of screaming soccer moms, and the rear units overlook part of the Wildhorse Golf Club Wildhorse Golf Course. There are many visitor parking spots, but be warned that management will tow cars that repeatedly park in visitor spots.

The Oak Tree Plaza and Davis Athletic Club are relatively close. But otherwise, expect a long walk to the nearest Unitrans bus stop (L line, Fremont Court) or a 4mile bike ride to campus.

If you want to live here, its best to search on craigslist for available condos or rooms.
