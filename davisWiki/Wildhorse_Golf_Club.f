Wildhorse Golf Club in the Wildhorse neighborhood is the most challenging, scenic, and well kept golf course in Davis. The green fees are expensive compared to most public courses, but rather reasonable for its condition (most public courses are not nearly as pretty).  Your first two tee shots are quite daunting with a large body of water in play on both.  A lot of trouble lurks on this rather long course.  If you want to enjoy your round and youre not that good (say you rarely break 100) it may be advised to play off the red tees.  For a more beginner friendly course try Davis Golf Course.  However, if youre looking for a more challenging, higher quality golf course, this place is a pretty good deal.

They have 40 acres of natural habitat worked into and around the course, home to burrowing owls and natural ponds.

20080614 15:21:23 nbsp Great golfing but grill is reaching. Its like eating at a hotdog cart in front of Homedepot. Dont get me wrong I like hotdogs but dont try to sell this place as a gourmet restaurant. Users/Kicker

20090905 19:00:10 nbsp I had the worst golf experience ever at this place.  The management was very very rude.  I would recommend going to the other courses in the area.  I have never been treated so poorly as a customer in my life.  Mr. Gaylord needs to learn how to work with people Users/AndyMartinez

20100611 13:12:38 nbsp This is a great golf range/course. The mats in the range is a little old and some are slightly ripped, but most of them work just fine, I love going there. However, recommend going to other places for the golf course. Users/xgen
