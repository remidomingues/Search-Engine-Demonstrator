Wildhorse has lovely greenbelts  some landscaped with paved paths, benches, playgrounds and fitness stops, others left in their natural state.

One section of the The Greenbelt Davis Greenbelt connects to the Green Meadows Greenbelt.  It is located in East Davis, in the Wildhorse neighborhood.

Public open space also borders the perimeter of the Wildhorse Golf Course and includes a Wildlife Buffer Zone and Burrowing Owl Habitat. A Ushaped South Wildhorse Greenbelt, accessible from Moore Boulevard between Sargent Court and Whistler Court, provides a shady, sheltered way for joggers and walkers to get from Covell Boulevard into Wildhorse. Neighborhood kids call this greenbelt the Pinecone Park because of the carpet of pine needles and cones created by a grove of heritage Canary Island Pines. One of these is the home of a nesting Swainsons Hawk.
