UC Davis offers an undergraduate B.S. degree (as well as a Minors minor) in Wildlife, Fish, and Conservation Biology under the College of Ag College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences.  The major and minor programs are the only ones in the department of the same name.  Rather than pronouncing all 11 syllables, most students refer to the Majors major as WFC or WFCB.  The department does not have its own graduate program, but faculty are involved with several other graduate groups on campus in the fields of Animal Behavior, Applied Mathematics, Avian Sciences, Ecology, Geography, Molecular, Cellular, & Integrative Physiology, and Population Biology.

There are nine areas of specialization, including the opportunity to create a customized specialization with a common theme.  Notsoaverage labs include fish identification, Birds and Bird Watching bird identification, and wild mammal identification (especially rodents), while incorporating numerous field trips into class time.
