20100121 10:44:30 nbsp Will, right now you are my favorite editor so far in 2010 (and there have been a few really good ones).  Best... editor... of... the decade!  Those new entries are golden. Users/JabberWokky

20100121 21:51:43 nbsp I love all the DHS hall of famer pages.  Lots of fun reading through them! Users/TomGarberson

20100128 02:13:48 nbsp Material from the Enterprise is generally copyrighted and thus cant be posted here without permission (and without noting that its copyrighted material).  I like the pages youve been creating, but Id be more careful  you need to rewrite the material and, if possible, note the source (for the longer things, like the enterprise obituary sources).  Ive gone through and noted the pages that I saw as mostly copy/paste jobs. Users/PhilipNeustrom

20130128 21:21:50 nbsp Fish and game recommends you not even eat some fish out of the sac river, and limit consumption of certain species to 3 servings max a week (for the average adult male) due to mercury / PCBS . The migratory fish even get limited in servings...

And yet its as clean as the water that filters thru 1000+ feet to get into the aquifer?

20130623 11:44:01 nbsp Realizing Im WAY to late in making this comment for it to make a difference, I will say that I take issue with some of the deletions of Enterprise content. Not everything published in the paper is property of the paper. If it is an article written by their staff or an oped by their editors, it is clearly their property. If, on the other hand, it is a piece written by an outside group and SUBMITTED to the Enterprise, it is still the property of the group who authored it. Groups often submit such pieces to multiple outlets for publication. So, in the case of Measure I, if it is the Enterprise staff oped, that would require Enterprise permission to publish. If it is an oped penned by the Yes on Measure I campaign that was submitted for publication in the Enterprise, it is up to the authors (and the campaign) whether it is also published in DavisWiki.
