Will Sim is Townies an alumnus of DaVinci High School from its first graduating class, and hates the fact that the founders of the school couldnt get poor ol Leos name right. People like to yell his full name at him rather than simply saying hello. If your desire to speak to him is just too much to bear, you can definitely reach him at his mailto:williamtsim@gmail.com email, which he definitely checks all the time.

Definitely.
