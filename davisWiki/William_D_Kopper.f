William Kopper served on the City Council from 3/20/1976 to 6/20/1984. He served as city mayor from 1982 to 1983.

William D. Kopper served on the Davis City Council from 1976 through 1984, and was Mayor of Davis from 1982 through 1984.  Mr. Kopper moved to Davis in January of 1973 to study for a Masters Degree in the Ecology Group at UC Davis.  After receiving an MS degree in 1974, he worked for Living Systems, which developed the pioneering Davis Energy Conservation Ordinance.

Mr. Kopper rode a wave of student activism into office.  Elected at age 28, Mr. Kopper was the second youngest person to serve on the Davis City Council.  While in office, Mr. Kopper championed the Resolution to restart the Davis Farmer’s Market.  At the time of Mr. Kopper’s election the first attempt at starting a Farmer’s Market in Davis had failed.  The first Market consisted of a group of booths in Central Park, and the concept did not catch on.  Mr. Kopper pushed through the City Council Martin Barnes’ idea of a market where people with pickup trucks would sell their produce at the curbside.

Mr. Kopper is credited with saving the HuntBoyer Mansion at Second and E Street from the wrecking ball.  During his two terms in office Mr. Kopper fought to limit the size of peripheral shopping centers, and to control the growth of the City.   Mr. Kopper has worked throughout his life to prevent rampant sprawl around the City of Davis.  The difference between Davis, which is well planned with a vibrant downtown, and many other valley cities is due in part to Mr. Kopper’s efforts.

Mr. Kopper was honored with the Thong Hy Huynh Lifetime Achievement Award in 2004 for promoting civil rights in Davis.

Mr. Kopper is a past President of the Yolo County Bar Association, the ACLU Yolo Branch of the American Civil Liberties Union, and the Yolo Childrens Fund.  Mr. Kopper currently serves as an officer for the Yolo Childrens Fund.
