Willow Creek Horse Park is a facility for boarding horses.  It is a very new, high end facility with trainers on site and excellent care. About a 10 minute drive from Davis.

2013 Rates
$475 for a stall with large paddock and access to all facilities.

Hay fed twice daily, stalls cleaned, and bedded with (plenty of) shavings. A selection of hay is always available and usually includes alfalfa, some kind of grass (rye or otherwise), alfalfagrass mix, and some kind of oat, wheat, or threeway mix. However, the hay selection may change depending on what is available in the area. The barn is equipped with a fly spray system during fly season and each paddock has an overhead mister for hot days.

Boarders are friendly, approachable, and helpful toward each other. There is no specific popular discipline as people ride western, event, hunter/jumper, dressage, bareback, or ride around the farm roads. Its really a variety of horses and people. Arenas are always available to ride in and theres never an issue sharing an arena while a trainer is teaching a lesson.

Large outdoor arena with full course of jumps, smaller outdoor arena (connected to larger) for warmup, poles, etc., outdoor trail course with a hill, indoor arena with lights and fantastic footing, outdoor dressage court, three round pens, four turn out paddocks, plenty of trailer parking (this may be extra per month, but ask), and access to farm roads for riding.


20090926 16:00:41 nbsp This place is very fancy, nice facilities, all brand new. The horses all have a stall and a run, and theres an indoor and huge outdoor arena. They only have a couple dirt turnouts though, which you can put your horse in if you want. I personally got warned away by the drama, but that is sort of inevitable at most barns so if you dont mind that this certainly doesnt seem like a bad place to keep your horse (I toured the place but did not board a horse there). Both the owner and manager are very nice. Users/imjustjoking22

20130930 08:08:55 nbsp This is a wonderful place to board and the owners dont advertise much so its a pretty laid back place with great people. I added the additional info above because its a place worth boarding. Considering high boarding prices in this area, this barn offers some of the best facilities and best hay selections for the cost. My horse doesnt require tons of extra supplements because they feed enough. Ive never had to ask for extra shavings because the stalls are bedded well. The staff is easy to work and Ive called several times to report something broken or a wasp nest, and the barn manager fixes it that same day. Arenas are groomed regularly and the indoor arena is groomed EVERY DAY. Users/ChardaeJones
