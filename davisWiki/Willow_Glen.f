Willow Glen contains 12 units all at very Affordable Housing affordable rates for those Senior Citizens seniors who qualify. Willow Glen is a 12unit senior complex that was also part of the land dedication. Willow Glen is comprised of 11 twobedroom units and 1 onebedroom unit. Each senior unit has a washer and dryer, two patios, and spacious living area.

In order to keep the cost of living affordable, Willow Glen takes advantage of many different resources made available through both private and public organizations. The bulk of the financing for the project is from the Department of Housing and Community Developmentâ€™s Rental Housing Construction Program, the Savings Associations Mortgage Company, and through the sale of federal and state LowIncome Housing Tax Credits.
