Willow Slough is the outflow for Cache Creek. It is an important source of irrigation, a floodcontrol channel, and a riparian habitat for Birds and Birding birds, amphibians, and mammals. In the Davis Timeline/1890 1890s, Willow Slough had yearround, clear water of such quality as to lead Woodland Woodlands politicians to suggest the use of it for civic domestic consumption. Channelization, land planing, devegetation, and monocultural, highchemical agriculture have impoverished the sloughs into relics of their former past condition.

Willow Slough is home to Swainsons Hawks, Great Horned and Barn Owls, egrets, herons, ducks, and many other species. The slough provides important visual diversity in this very flat landscape, and offers a corridor for many animals to move about the land in safety. Without the sloughs and small creeks, there would be no highquality valley soils, and our bioregion would not be what it is today.
