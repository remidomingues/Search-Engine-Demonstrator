Willowbank Ditch is small riparian area behind Putah Creek Park in South Davis off of Lillard Ave at El Campo Ave or Ohlone Street. You can walk along the north side of the water (the south side is private property).  This area can house some great Birds and Bird Watching birds during fall and spring migration.  There is a particular area that is sectioned off as bird habitat.  This is nothing compared to Putah Creek Putah Creeks riparian area: expect a lot of cement and neighborhoodlike stuff going on. Nonetheless, you can find Davis usual riparian suspects here such as the Western ScrubJay and the Yellowbilled Magpie.
