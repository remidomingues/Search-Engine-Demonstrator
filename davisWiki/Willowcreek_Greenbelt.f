This section of the The Greenbelt connects to Willowcreek Park and the Putah Creek Greenbelt.  It is located in South Davis.


Here is a picture of the old pump house on the Willowcreek Greenbelt and bike path. This pic was taken between Woodbridge and Putah Creek Park, west of San Marino Drive in South Davis.


Is this a section of the Davis Bike Loop?  Looks familiar, but then, a lot of the greenbelts look pretty similar. Users/TomGarberson
