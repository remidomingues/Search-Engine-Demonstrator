In general, it blows.  Fortunately, Davis is not too windy of a place (despite getting North wind).  A good place to find real time wind speed and direction is the http://awos.ucdavis.edu/ AWOS station at the University Airport.
Prevailing wind direction in Davis is SSW most of the year. NNW occurs often enough in December and January that the wind can be said to prevail from that direction in those two months. The rest of the year NNW wind (called north wind) is intermittent, but gustier than our usual prevailing Delta breeze (which is SSW).

Occasionally we get a weather windstorm that tosses a bunch of branches around, dries out your face, and sends your allergy season allergies off the charts.  They can pop up a few times a year and last for a day or two. These are usually winds coming from the northwest.
