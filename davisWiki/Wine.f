Hot Mulled Wine

Users/AndrewBanta makes a killer hot wine of sorts, its like cider and delicious, he should post his secret ways...Users/MichelleAccurso

Ah, correct you are Ms. Accurso.  What he makes is called: Hot Mulled Wine.  I use a Cabernet Sauvignon.  You could buy prepackaged mulling spices.  However, I opt to make my own mulling spices from scratch.  Ingredients are as follows:

 whole allspice
 whole clove
 fresh orange zest
 brown sugar
 cinnamon sticks

Put the whole mess in crockpot and cook on a lower setting for approx. 6 to 8 hours, I spice to taste.  I tend to use a bit of purified water, since the wine can become a bit pungent.  I recommend adding only half the bottle at first so you dont cook all the alcohol out of the wine.
