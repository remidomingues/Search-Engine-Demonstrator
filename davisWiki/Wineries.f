Wineries are organizations which take grapes from vineyards, press them to get grape juice, and ferment the juice to make wine. Wineries sell the wine and often offer wine tastings. You can find wineries around Davis, especially if you venture up to Napa Valley, but there are a few wineries in Davis itself. If youre just interested in vineyards, many wineries have grape vines, and UC Davis UCDs Vinecology department has student vineyards located west of Campus campus and The Colleges.

Here are some wineries in and around Davis:

     Small little winery about 20 minute bike ride (less by car) from West Davis. Go down Russell, turn left on County Road 98. If youre on bike and a bit daring, you can cut through some fields and make the bike ride much shorter. As of March 2014, they have sold almost all of their stock of wines and will be permanently closed after this weekend.
  Satiety Winery & Cafe
     (530) 6610680
     40101 County Road 25a (Woodland)
     This place is a bit odd its run by an exUCD science Prof. who claims that wine making isnt rocket science...and it shows  the wine is horrible!
    As of 11/9/07 a Winery For Sale sign popped up on the Satiety property. It can be seen from HWY 113 near the Road 25A exit...It is supposed that the Winery is finally going out of business.

     26836 County Road 12a in (Esparto)
     http://www.nightharvest.com or http://www.toastedhead.com
     I would NOT suggest the RH Phillips winery, as they http://www.newsreview.com/issues/sacto/20040923/cover.asp mistreat their ag workers.
      I WOULD suggest RH Phillips winery. Its always free wine tasting and they make Toasted Head wine. The winery is about half an hour drive from Davis so its a little out there but really pretty and some nice people work behind the tasting bar.
       They once were family owned, but have twice been sold to larger corporate entities. I prefer Bogle: not tiny but still family owned.
        There is no evidence at their web site that they have a tasting room in Esparto, as of March 2014
  Wooden Valley Winery
     (707) 8640730 in Fairfield (Suisun Valley)

     good, cheap wine (and sparkling wine!). tasting room closed on Mondays.
