Wingstop opened on G Street on May 8, 2013. It offers all the usual fare youd expect from a Wingstop, including the aviationthemed decor, hitormiss service, and an assortment of deepfried chicken wings.

Among the different types of wing flavors (in descending order of hotness) they offer are: Atomic, Cajun, Original Hot, Louisiana Rub, Mild, Lemon Pepper, Garlic Parmesan, Hickory Smoked Barbecue, Hawaiian and Teriyaki. You have the option of getting them bonein or boneless (but what kind of abomination is a boneless chicken wing?).

Inside, they have one of those http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CocaCola_Freestyle CocaCola Freestyle machines, which supposedly offer more than 100 drink options. At certain points of the day, however, some flavors will be unavailable, due to the machine being out of that kind of syrup.

From Wendy Weitzel Wendy Weitzels Davis Enterprise Comings and Goings column:

 Wingstop is coming to 408 G St., in the space next to El Mariachi, across from Western Feed & Pet Supply Western Feed and Pet Supply. Thereâ€™s an application posted in the window for selling beer and/or wine.

 The family takeout restaurant has more than 500 locations in the U.S. The eateries make chicken wings Buffalo wings to order, and offer 10 different dipping sauces. Side orders include seasoned fries, veggie sticks, and yeast rolls. Visit http://www.wingstop.com for chain information.

20130612 10:45:16 nbsp The owner of Wingstop came by my store a while back and introduced himself before they opened and invited me to his soon to be open restaurant, and yesterday I finally had the time to head over. My fiancee and I headed over with a couple of friends we had not seen in a while. Everyone seemed very pleased with their order, which included the garlic Parmesan, and honey bbq. I had the cajun, which I felt was a little salty, but no deal killer. The fries were a little soggy, but tasty. At the end of the meal we were discussing coming back again and trying other things, but something changed our mind. We were asked to get up and leave. We were there for maybe an hour and forty five minutes, including waiting for our food (which took about 10/15 minutes). They said they needed tables for newer, presumably more important, guests. I looked up, expecting to see a packed Wingstop behind me, only to find one person ordering and I think one other table open (maybe a person was getting their drink?). I was pretty disappointed, as was the rest of my group. I didnt want to make a scene or anything so we left and chatted on the curb for another few minutes. When my fiancee and I walked back in front of the restaurant guess what we saw! Our table, that we had been kicked out of, was still open! I guess the moral of this story is get in, eat your food, and get the hell out. Sorry Wingstop, I wont be returning.

20130701 00:31:00 nbsp Dont believe the hours! Sure, it might seem like Wingstop is one of the places that is open late in Davis. However, the last two times Ive been there, theyve closed early. Tonight I came a whole hour before midnight, and they were locked up! So much for late night wing cravings. I definitely wont be making the trip all the way downtown again.  Users/LisaJackson

20130701 03:43:15 nbsp Its chain style. Spicy isnt that spicy. Food is kinda pricy. Ehh. That coupled with Krause tale above leaves me to conclude that this BBQ is lackluster Users/StevenDaubert

20130702 00:16:51 nbsp As a huge fan of Wingstop, Im severely disappointed by this location. Music was blaring and the fries were soggy when me and my girlfriend ate at this place a few weeks ago. I dont expect an immaculate dining experience here, but I know they can do better, judging by the other locations throughout Sacramento. I hope theyre just going through the growing pains of being a new place in town. Users/CecilioPadilla

20130707 23:45:18 nbsp Drove there in hopes of late night food but was closed at only 11:10. Apparently new hours closes at 11:00PM Users/NavLee

20130708 23:43:05 nbsp Change your hours on the website to 11PM on Mondays also, cause thats when you close on Mondays Users/Wingasaurus

20130709 12:32:06 nbsp Good wings, staff is average in service, and they close whenever they see fit. They need to fix their store hours so people do not drive out an hour before they close and only find out that they already closed up. Waste of a drive. Users/EricMedina

20130709 14:40:02 nbsp I actually called and talked to an employee who said that closing time is up to the manager. Its all based on how busy they are on that particular night. And I know from personal experience that closing could be as early as 10:30! Im glad the other late night places in Davis honor their hours :/ They also close before everyone has left. One time there were still four full tables when they locked the doors. Its awkward when they start putting up tables and turn off the soda machine when you were expecting to be able to take your time eating. Instead, you feel youre keeping the employees from going home. Stupid.  Users/LisaJackson

20130710 19:53:38 nbsp Just ordered a ten piece bonein. Five garlic Parmesan, five lemon pepper. Garlic Parmesan was ok, but lemon pepper was suuuper salty! And did something happen with their supplier? The pieces I got were really tiny compared to the ones I had a few months ago. The chicken barely had any meat on the bones and a bunch of the legs had a small chunk of meat and skin near the big joint while the majority of the leg was completely bare! Not even any skin to cover it! What happened??? Also, I recommend ordering by phone so you can save yourself the drive in case theyre not open. If you call in with your order, by the time you drive over, the chicken will be ready too. Their menu is on the website. Users/EmilyCharlotteLiu



20130716 14:47:44 nbsp So overpriced!! Wings were good enough, but there are places to get cheaper AND tastier wings in Davis. Right across the street at Village Pizza, actually. For faster service though, Id recommend the Grad or 3rd and Uand I can tell you that theyre always hopping and wont close down before their hours say they will! Lol Users/AlexLee2
