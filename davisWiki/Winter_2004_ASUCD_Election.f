The Winter 2004 ASUCD Election was the second election to use choice voting and was a rare election, an independent candidate not only won, but came in second place. Independent candidate Donald CohenCutler who ran on the slogan break the slate came in second place behind number one votereceiver Adam Barr. CohenCutlers victory paved the way for more succesful independent and third party involvement; Keith Shively, Avi Singh, Rob Roy, Kristen Birdsall, Michael Molnar.
The author of the choice voting ASUCD amendment, Sonny Mohammadzadeh, also ran, but was unsuccesful. Sonny, who was backed by the Green Party might be attributed to planting the seeds for the creation of Students for an Orwellian Society slate and Friends Urging Campus Kindness. The Green party was rumored to be putting together a slate for this election, but none materialized.
The executive ticket was also unique as it saw an independent ticket, Evan Beecher and Ryan Basilio. Another unique featuer is that the California Aggieendorsed executive ticket, Levale Simpson and Pam Palpallatoc did not win.

Additionally, the Student Bill of Rights appeared on the ballot as ASUCD Constitution Constitutional Amendment 1 and passed with roughly 80% of the voters approving it with a yes vote.
