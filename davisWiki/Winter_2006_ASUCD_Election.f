Another quarter means another ASUCD Elections ASUCD Election for the undergraduate students of UC Davis.  This election has not yielded any scandals yet, though you never know with this Elections Committee.  The election was a decisive victory for LEAD, who retained the Presidency and zerg rushed the Senate for 4 seats.  At the end of this election, LEAD controls 2/3 of the Senate, the Executive, and has appointed every justice of the ASUCD Court save Users/KrisFricke Chief Justice Fricke.

Results are now available at https://elections.ucdavis.edu/ the elections website.  A http://davischoicevoting.org/asucd/senate2006wint/summary.html graphical breakdown of the Senate results is also available.

There were many issues on the table, from the creation of an ASUCD Publicity Committee, making a recording studio for KDVS, and restoring integrity to the Senate.  These were all part of the platforms of the candidates and Slate slates running:

  Student Focus
  L.E.A.D.
  Ignite
  and four Independent independents

See the slate pages for platforms, and look at the individual candidate pages for the independents.

 Presidential Candidates 
As normal, there were two tickets of /Presidential Candidates presidential candidates from the incumbent slates.


 Senatorial Candidates 
There were 14 candidates running for 6 seats  see /Senate Candidates details of specific candidates.

The winners were:

  Michael A. Molnar (Ignite)
  Marvin Zamora (L.E.A.D.)
  Naomi Amaha (L.E.A.D.)
  Dwaimy RosasRomero (L.E.A.D.)
  Ravi Deepak (L.E.A.D.)
  George Ajlouny (Student Focus)

 Ballot Measure 

There was one Constitutional Amendment on this ballot, authored by Users/BrentLaabs Brent Laabs.  Its a fairly simple matter involving the wiki:wikipedia:pocket veto in ASUCD.  Article IV Section 9 prohibits pocket vetoes, but the language of Section 10 is vague enough that it seems to allow pocket vetoes.  This amendment clarifies the latter section so that bills must be explicitly vetoed by the ASUCD President.

This amendment is the precursor to a veritable barrage of constitutional amendments coming up in the Fall election, most of which are only for clarifying the constitution.

Since SGAO is too lame to put the Amendment on the ASUCD Website, its hosted http://atm.ucdavis.edu/~bslaabs/CA_9.doc here.

This ballot measure passed by a large margin.

 Earlier Potential Candidates 
  Users/JimSchwab wanted to run for President with LEAD, but his financial aid was cut and he was unable to run (because he would have to work too much on outside jobs to be an effective President).
  Student Focus lost multiple Senate candidates and is not running a full slate.
  Greg Russell decided to embark on a national college football tour in the fall, which would likely conflict with a seat on the ASUCD Senate. He was also concerned about potential conflicts between senate and his work as Director of City and County Affairs.
  The Elections Committee Slate also led a spirited albeit fictional early campaign.
  Molly Sundstrom pulled out on Jan 29^th^.

 Averted Disasters 

To keep with tradition, the California Aggie advertising department lost the order for the Sample Ballot. This may sound familiar because it happened in the Fall 2005 ASUCD Election. On Friday, February 17th, the Aggie contacted the Elections Committee Media Coordinator and claimed that they did not have an order for a 2page advertisement. Thankfully the Elections Committee learned to never trust the Aggie and had Creative Media make the advertisement; some say that we have the gift of foresight.

The Aggie was then emailed and informed that indeed we had ugraded our advertisement to two full pages. On Tuesday, February 21, (when the sample ballot was run in the Aggie) the Elections Committee Media Coordinator went down to the Aggie to fill out a new order to pay for the advertisement. At this point, the Aggie informed her that they had found the order.

Also, Student Focus did not have a campaign treasurer sign the forms for the voluntary expenditure agreement for all of their candidates.  The Elections Committee briefly considered disqualifying the entire slate, but instead decided to give the slate a few more hours to have them find someone to sign the forms.  There are rumors that someone from LEAD offered to sign the forms for Focus before they were due, but that Chris Herold refused.
    Actually, what happened was that they had someone fill out the first page of the 10page Expenditure Form but this person didnt sign the rest of the pages. Seeing as I got this job after the Rob Roy Disqualification Controversy and said I wouldnt disqualify candidates on technicalities, we had no intention of disqualifying the entire slate. However, Users/RevChad Chad and Users/JonathonLeathers I joked about it to one another. Their Expenditure Forms were all correct just missing a signature, so they had Spencer Higgins sign the form and be the Campaign Treasurer instead. This only would have been a disaster if we had actually tried to disqualify the entire slate.  Users/JonathonLeathers

 Comparison to PreChoice Voting 

We can estimate what the results would have been under ASUCDs old block voting system by counting the number of choices each candidate got in the top six.  We cant be sure this would be the actual result, as the voting behavior of individual voters would probably change somewhat.  But it should be close.

By this calculation, L.E.A.D. would have swept the election (as they actually did in the Winter 2001 election).  You can even see that the candidates are bunched together by slate, in order of the slates popularity.

 Most LastPlace Choices 

Some voters decide to vote all of the way to the last place  since these votes cannot concievably help a candidate, they represent the Most Hated Man on Campus award.  The most hated man in ASUCD this year is Mo Li, followed by Michael Molnar who will hold a seat on the Senate.
