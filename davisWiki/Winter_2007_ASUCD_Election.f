20061215 01:00:06 nbsp did anyone notice that the navbar has the wrong logo? this will be winter 2007 Users/PaulHarms

20061215 01:14:30 nbsp Were going back in time Paul.   Users/SteveOstrowski

20061225 21:55:05 nbsp thanks steven.  that would explain the Christian Slate...we must be on our way back to the Middle Ages. Users/PaulHarms

20061226 01:13:59 nbsp Considering that nearly all of the Lead candidates have been identified, yet there is hardly any intelligence on Focus activities, it seems like LID isnt being very effective. ;) Users/NigelAndrassey

20061226 11:31:33 nbsp That was typical of the last election as well.  Users/SteveOstrowski

20061226 16:55:47 nbsp LID isnt posting StuFos candidates, even though they know 5 out of 6.  Joe Levy seems to have taken responsibility for the posting on the StuFo side, and hes taking his sweet time. Users/PaulHarms

20061227 01:16:54 nbsp Ditto to what Mr. Harms said. Just because LID doesnt post doesnt mean LID doesnt know... Users/KevinPowers

20070127 11:16:24 nbsp Ok, yeah I just noticed the 2006 instead of 2007. Is anyone going to change that? Users/TusharRawat

20070130 00:34:25 nbsp A slate with two people was stretching it... A slate of one? Thats rediculous.  I think if you refer to the wikis own definition of slate, youd find slates are coalitions of candidates who team up to campaign for an office during a single election.  Who are you teaming up with if youre running by yourself?!  If I were even remotely still involved (Im just passing by out of curiosity) Id insist that youd move the slate candidates who have only one person into the Independent category.  Luckily for Ostrowskis brain child, Im not in a position to care. Users/ThomasLloyd

20070130 00:45:58 nbsp Its consistent with last year.   Users/SteveOstrowski
  Which was a moronic precedent you started.  Users/WilliamLewis
  Albert can have his deal, Ron can have his.  The Election Committee doesnt care one way or the other.  Users/SteveOstrowski
    ASUCD Bylaws: Chapter 4, Section 401, Subsection B. reads A Slate is any group of candidates and/or Tickets who run together under a common name or common slogan. The Bylaw clearly states that a slate consist of more than one person. However, the ASUCD Bylaws dont apply to the Wiki, so Ill leave it to someone else to edit the page if they feel it is important.  Users/JonathonLeathers
     Bylaws ftw Users/MaxMikalonis MM
  Rons a good placeholder to help give his slate a bit more credability and longevity.  Give it a long run!  I bet there will be at least one person per election on it, and probably like Kirk, they dont even give a crap but just got talked into it.  It also gives people a common person to vote against, rather than Student Focus or Act or whatever he really supports.  Users/EdWins ES
  XI dont like your negativity, we will beat some slate candidates and have a chance of winning.   Users/SteveOstrowskiX no chance now ~D
    I would actually love to see this. Cowgill placed 17/17 more than any other candidate during the Fall 2006 elections. Youll probably have a better chance of getting votes running without a slate. Users/TusharRawat Tushar

20070204 20:15:49 nbsp Did Roy and Abraham register their ticket under Dont vote for Rob and Arlen that name? If so, then they arent running an exec ticket as independents, their running under that name. But if they didnt submit forms like that, its indep. Correct me if im wrong. Users/MaxMikalonis
   No executive tickets have to turn in anything formally declaring a slate name. The closest thing is the expenditure reports that all candidates turn in because LEAD and Student Focus pool their money and split the total across all candidates. So they can call themselves whatever they want as far as I know. (Feel free to correct me if you find something in the Bylaws).  Users/JonathonLeathers

20070223 03:14:55 nbsp I already know the results are going to be bad for me but at least I can ride Unitrans next year. Users/GregWebb

20070223 14:31:57 nbsp Wow, this voter turnout was huge!  Whens the last time it broke 20%?   Users/EdWins ES
  Fall 2002 had 27% voter turnout for the D1 ballot measure. I only have turnout data until Fall 2000 so all I can say for sure is that this is the second highest turnout since Fall 2000.  Users/JonathonLeathers

20070223 15:06:24 nbsp Awesome. It looks like the Unitrans measure passed after all. Users/TusharRawat TR

20070223 18:53:52 nbsp Im glad the Unitrans referendum passed.  I get to keep my job, thanks guys ;) Users/WaylandLee

20070224 02:55:06 nbsp Gotta love Choice Voting, it helped Cem out.  Usenima was so close to victory (3 votes).  Very fun election. Users/GregWebb
