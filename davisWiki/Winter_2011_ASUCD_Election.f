 Vote Count
Summary of voting
The comprehensive report Creative Media puts out for every election can be found here: https://elections.ucdavis.edu/results/elec_21/index.html

3,346 voters expressed a preference, meaning the threshold for electing six senators was 479 votes.  In the first round, Yena Bae was elected with an astounding 849 first preference ballots, more than twice that of her nearest competitor.  This gives Yena the record for most #1 votes in the history of Choice Voting, beating the previous title holder Lula AhmedFalol by 103 votes.

Yenas ballots were transferred to their next preference at 370/849 power, or 0.4 votes per ballot.  It appears Yenas support was extremely personal rather than distributed to the BOLD slate, and 228.8 of those 370 extra votes, or 525 ballots of her 849 first preference supporters, did not state a second preference.  If all of Yenas votes had transferred to BOLD candidates, the remaining 5 BOLD candidates would have had an average of 333.6 votes each, or 4 candidates would have had 417 votes each, perhaps enough to elect one more Senator.

Caitlin Alday, Edd Montelongo, Richard Yu, Arasele Torrez Jiminez, Ryan Meyerhoff, and Anna Ruth Crittenden were eliminated before Brendan Repicky reached the 479 vote quota.

Jared CrisologoSmith was eliminated and Amy Martin was the third Senator to reach quota.

Finally, because there were only three candidates remaining and three seats left, Miguel Espinoza, Mayra Martín, and Eli Yani were elected as each had greater than half of the quota.
