 Bizarro World 
Imagine a world without Choice Voting.  Or one in which the person who gets the most last place votes is sent to participate in a battle royale of hunger games.  Welcome to ASUCD Election Bizarro World.

All of the usual disclaimers apply, about how voter behavior would be different if they were in a pick6 system, etc.


 Top 6 
If voters had elected their top 6 choices instead, the winners would be...

 Most Hated 
People who ranked their ballots all the way down to the 15th place voted for a candidate who will mathematically never receive their vote.  For those who come up last, they become the Most Hated Person on Campus  a badge of honor for some.

Condorcet Winner
The http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method Condorcet winner (the least objectionable candidate) of this election was Joyce Han.

 Endorsements 
Breaking with tradition, The California Aggie did not endorse any candidates in this election and instead http://www.theaggie.org/2012/02/21/editorialboardasucdsenateandexecutiveelections/ wrote evaluations of the candidates based on interviews done by the Aggie editorial board.
