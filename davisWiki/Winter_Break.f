Winter Break is a concept known to all but experienced mostly by students at UC Davis and other Schools schools.  For UC students, Winter Break starts whenever your last Final is (at most, Dec. 18^th^) and then lasts until Winter quarter begins (Jan. 3^rd^).  While its not likely to Snow snow here in Davis, it certainly does in other areas of the world.  Students typically flee Davis in great numbers, leaving the town feeling much lonelier than it did before.
