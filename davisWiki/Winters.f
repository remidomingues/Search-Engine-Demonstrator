 Getting there 
 On a Bicycle 
Beginning at Russell Boulevard and Hwy 113, head west (towards the hills) and follow the bike path to its end (about 5 miles out). Turn left on County Road 95a which will take you across the famous Stevenson Bridge. After crossing the bridge, make a right turn onto Putah Creek Road (youre about 6.5 miles out here). Follow Putah Creek Road all the way to Winters. You will know youre almost in Winters when the road appears to deadend into another road. At this intersection, youll see an old railroad bridge thats been converted into a pedestrian bridge and an ugly concrete bridge just to the left of it. Just go right over either bridge, and youre in Winters. (Adapted from from Bicycle Rides)
