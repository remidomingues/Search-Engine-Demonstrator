The Winters Art Walk is one of the best kept secrets of the community art scene. Its smaller than either the Davis or Sacramento art walks. It occurs the week before the other walks (ArtAbout and Sacramento Second Saturday) on the first Saturday of the month, so it doesnt conflict. One of the main participating galleries is the Briggs & Co Briggs & Co. gallery, another is the http://www.wintersarts.org Winters Center for the Arts.

If youve never been on an art gallery walk, I highly recommend it. Free food, great art, cool people. It changed my world. Really. Users/SteveDavison
