The Winters Express, or just Express, is the local newspaper for Winters. It is published weekly, on Thursdays. Single copy cost is $.50 (or $.47 for the paper plus $.03 tax on the information, as they say!) The editor, Debra J. Lo Guercio, is known to Davis Enterprise readers for her Because I Say So column. They call themselves the A solar powered newspaper. To their credit, their newspapers (since 20040630) are available online for free as .pdf files. The errata is included as color correction marks. The paper is owned by McNaughton Newspapers, as is the Davis Enterprise.
