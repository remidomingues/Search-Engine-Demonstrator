Located just downstream of downtown Winters, the Winters Swimming Hole found both Winters locals and adventurous Davisites enjoying its cool waters.  People can be found splashing into the water as they jump from a wellused rope swing.  People were also once seen sun bathing on the defunct concrete dam.

On October 10th, 2009 the dam was dismantled and the river was allowed to flow freely once again.
