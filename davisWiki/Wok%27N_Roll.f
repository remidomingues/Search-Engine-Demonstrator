WokN Roll is a familyownedandoperated Chinese fastfood establishment in downtown. The restaurant is closed as of September 2007.

Although peoples opinions vary, the food is cheap and quick.  They serve the generic Chinese food one would expect.  The best time to go would be at lunch when they first open since the food is freshly cooked.  The food is served cafeteriastyle, so show up early to avoid getting food that has succumbed to the heat lamp.  A cook is in the back preparing food all day long, though, and the food is often fresh no matter what time of the day it is.

20041012 23:44:58 nbsp WoknRoll serves what is, quite possibly, the worst Chinese food known to man. From overcooked (to the point of crunchiness) rice to fishytasting kung pao chicken, this is a restaurant you will likely eat at once... or never, if you heed this warning. It is extremely cheap, though. Users/PaulLanzi

20041114 00:22:51 nbsp The problem with W n R is that the food just sits under a heat lamp.  Its okay when its fresh, although maybe the recipes need some work.  Their hot n sour soup is a pretty good snack for just walking around Davis at 69 cents (74 cents w/tax).  Also good is their potstickers, which they make for you on request, thus avoiding the heatlamp problem.  The folks who run the place are really nice.  Users/JaimeRaba jr

20041209 19:25:41 nbsp Their general chicken is pretty tasty, and Im rather fond of their chow mein. No, Im not claiming its authentic in any way, shape, or form. I just likes it, thats all. :p  Users/BarnabasTruman

20041228 23:07:39 nbsp Isnt chow mein in any form inauthentic? Users/NoahPretentious

20050207 21:33:12 nbsp I like their lemon grass chicken... kind of a curry.  Ive generally not been enthusiastic about the rest of their menu. Users/JeffNewmiller
20050301 01:55:04 nbsp unless your grandmother cooks REAL Chinese food, its as good as anywhere else.  I cant tell the difference, and its cheap.  Gotta love cheap when youre in college.  I recommend it Users/KevinSanada

20050331 22:20:02 nbsp I have to say this is the worst Chinese food Ive ever eaten.  I did go there around 7:30 one night, so maybe it was the heatlamps.  Still, you will be much better served to go to Orange Hut or Mr. Chans. Users/NickCarrigan

20050401 00:16:38 nbsp I love Wok N Roll. I used to eat their every day until I moved to the other side of town. Their mixed vegetables and Tofu is the best in town. Plus they have vegetarian fried rice and chow mein that I think is the best for Chinese fast food in town. Users/RobRoy

20051213 13:37:51 nbsp This place is HORRIBLE. Its cheap, yes, but the food is naaaasty. The chicken is gross and stringy. The rice is.. eew.. crunchy and gross. Nastiest Chinese food in town. Users/StaceyGalbreath

20051214 10:03:55 nbsp I have to agree with StaceyGalbreath but Its not horrible Users/LorenFinazzo

20051216 10:29:27 nbsp I enjoy going here if I want good, plenty food for cheap.  I ordered the teriyaki bowl and they gave me a lot of food.  And they are really nice. Users/JoAnnaRich

20060128 19:44:14 nbsp Lemon Chicken, Mandiran Chicken, or General Chicken Rice Bowl.  Good stuff.  When they are at the farmers market you can ask them to give you rice with sauce on it.  that is so good.  and cheap too! ForestReturned

20060516 08:57:52 nbsp Maybe this isnt the most authentic Chinese food that Davis has to offer, but for the money, its a good cheap lunch that Ive never had a hard time getting down the hatch.  I always try to get there right when they open, so the lunch buffet is nice and fresh.  Its always been good.  The people that work here are friendly too. Users/AdamSchneider

20060517 01:01:48 nbsp This place used to be called Tasty Choice. The food was identical.  Users/ChrisLambertus

20061114 13:32:32 nbsp I got sick eating uncooked pork one time, but I still go here from time to time. Users/JohnDudek

20070128 19:35:25 nbsp Local Family, decent to awesome food, and I went to school with the siblings. Users/StevenDaubert

20070420 10:45:13 nbsp i have to say that the general chicken was quite stale and i ate here at 11:05 in the morning, so there really isnt any excuses for that.  Overall its not bad for the price, similar in quality to what you would get at panda express, Hunan or orange hut.  Personally i think other places like Noodle Express have better lunch specials, for similar prices.  Odly enough, their orange chicken is neon red (ive only seen one other place do that and that was in LA). Users/MattHh

20070609 22:04:20 nbsp I agree with Paul. I went there for my first time recently to try it out. The only people in there were the workers, who were hanging around the tables, they didnt have chow mein and Im pretty sure they only had 2 choices for main dishes. I got the broccoli beef, which had crispy meat, and the sauce was almost like bbq sause. Though it was a good sized serving and only under $5, but I dont think Im going back. Users/KyleScollin

20070724 00:11:14 nbsp walked in no one there very weird then i was looking at all the food i have not ate since looked so bad please beware place is grose Users/dickjones

20070803 13:02:01 nbsp If looking to get fast low quality food this is the place for you! Users/Brians

20070917 16:26:05 nbsp who confirmed the closing? Is it not a remodel? Users/StevenDaubert

20070917 16:59:55 nbsp I read it in the Davis Enterprise, Sunday, Sept. 16, 2007, p. C7 (Wendy Weitzels Comings and Goings column).
