Howdy, and (just since this might be an old account who seldom comes here), welcome to the wiki!  Mr. or Ms. Center... or uh... who the heck are ya?  It might be a very very good idea to consider the importance of using your realname, so we can talk to you rather than a faceless entity.  Also, unless you are the only person who comprises all volunteers and members of the WomansCenter, youre claiming to speak for everybody by coopting the name.  Probably not what you intended, but youre not a person, youre a group.  Which really doesnt make much sense.  It might be a very good idea to disable this account (in settings), and then create an account under your name.  Howdy, Im Evan Edwards, but my wife and friends call me JabberWokky (old old nickname).  Right now I am rambling a bit as your not a real person account is kind of offputting, probably not the kind of thing a womans center wants to do.  You also set up your account as a redirect, which blocks off anybody from being able to talk to you (like this message  I had to delete the redirect just to speak to you).  Thats also probably not the friendliest thing to do; were a community here, and we try to work together as real people, not as internet accounts.  A final minor point, which was something somebody else raised: it might be a good idea to move the Western States Feminist Leadership Conference to a wiki where it is taking place or wiki:wikispot:create a wiki for it.  While it is certainly important, it does not seem to be taking place in Davis.  If thats incorrect, you might want to add the Davis specific relevance (are you trying to lobby to move the conference here?).  Youve been around the wiki for quite awhile, and I hope youll let us know who you are rather than using a royal we.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
