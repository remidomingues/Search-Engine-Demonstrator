20081029 12:11:59 nbsp Remember to write everything on the move in, Simmons Real Estate is currently trying to screw me out of 64 bucks for a screen when they told me it was broken when I had moved in due to me not writing it down. And remember to clean well, the cleaning is not cheap even if the ladies at the management office tell you it is. Users/HiD33Ho
