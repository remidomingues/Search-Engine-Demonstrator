20121012 15:28:46 nbsp Contracted with them to put pesticide in holes bored by carpenter bees.  They were also to put in copper wool (nonrusting) and stainable exterior wood filler.  First visit filled holes with nonhardening, nonstainable or paintable, interior putty.  After reading jar left, asked them to remove and fill with exterior stainable wood filler.  They brought interior patching compound.  I sent them away and complained.  They did drop any charges, BUT when I scraped the putty out to put in wood filler, I found steel wool, not copper wool as promised.  The facts speak for themselves.  Use at your own risk.

20130715 12:48:21 nbsp Saw the comments below and thought Id give these guys the benefit  However called them in to look at a potential wasp intrusion in my laundry room dryer outlet. The guy spent 5 minutes up a ladder with a brush and then disappeared only for me to discover a $100 invoice on my porch, No explanation of work or advice. Not impressed and had to call the office to find out what work was carried out, were there and chemicals used etc. as this outlet is right above our back door (I have young kids) . Would think twice about using these guys again. Users/nigelbrown
