WARD participants are women and men from the area. We are parents and college students. We are first time skaters and women who were born with skates on. We are emptynesters and recent high school graduates. We are a hodge podge collection of people who have a desire to play derby coming together from all walks of life, but most importantly, were family. We are always looking for new members. No experience needed, NO DUES to pay! Please visit our website for the most current practice information. Or text 5303413129 or email woodlandarearollerderby@gmail.com for more information.
