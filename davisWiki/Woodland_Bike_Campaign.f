Our Mission
Woodland Bike Campaigns mission is to educate and encourage more people in Woodland, CA and the surrounding areas to ride their bicycles.

About Our Organization
Woodland Bike Campaign (WBC) was founded in April 2012 to help educate and encourage more people in Woodland, CA to ride their bikes. The WBC sponsors four free bike clinics a year where people can bring their bikes in for a free tune up, learn about bike safety, proper riding, sign up to receive free or reduced cost bikes and helmets (based on need).

Woodland Bike Campaign works closely with the city of Woodland, the city of Davis, the local bike shops, and schools.

Woodland Bike Campaign encourages all ages to ride! And we love all types of bikes, from single speed to road bikes, to fixedgear to mountain to BMX.
