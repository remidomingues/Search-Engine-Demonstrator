20110220 11:45:21 nbsp I was called in for an interview last minute and I drove around town for any place that would be able to get my new suit altered that same day (some of you will know the frustration of buying new slacks but it being too long). NONE of the ones I visited could. Someone suggested I go to Woodland and with a little hesitation but a lot of desperation, I went. I was expecting another look of bewilderment from the front desk workers but the owners at Woodland Cleaners instead said they could do it for me right then and there! And actually, it took less than 30 minutes for the alteration lady to measure me and shorten my pants. After she was done, they ironed it for me (for free) and it looked perfect as if no work was even done. She did such a marvelous job. I will be returning with more long pants in the future.
