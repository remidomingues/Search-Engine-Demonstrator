This is a twoyear community colleges community college. Along with http://www.yccd.edu/yuba Yuba College (in wiki:yubasutter:Marysville) and the http://www.yccd.edu/clearlake Clear Lake Campus (in Clearlake), they are part of the http://www.yccd.edu Yuba Community College District. They have the advantage of being small: students can receive more attention if they so desire. Most courses here do not get filled as quickly as they do at the other community colleges. Parking also tends to be cheaper here and more plentiful. While the school doesnt have a cafeteria yet, the student lounge has vending machines, the bookstore has snacks, and there is a BelAir market and a strip mall across the street. Counselors, teachers, and administrators are accessible to students.

Going to this school and doing well is a great way to get into UCD, as they have a transfer agreement with WCC.  You can be a B student at WCC and be automatically accepted into UCD as a junior.  Itâ€™s a great way to make up for a poor performance in high school.  In addition, you will get a really good education at WCC, and you will feel like a member of a very cool family.
