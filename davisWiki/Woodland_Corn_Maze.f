The Woodland Corn Maze is back for 2010!  Sponsored again by the Heidrick Ag History Center, they are excited and ready to unveil this yearâ€™s new design.  The Maze is perfect for couples, groups, families and friends who want to try their luck by day or brave the dark at night.  You can try their fun and frightening Haunted Maze Friday and Saturday Nights in October.  Its a great laugh and a real SCREAM (get it?? scream?  Ha!)!

Located in Woodland, this seasonal attraction was the first corn maze in California.  It is similar to The Wooz except it is, well, a corn field. Once the maze closes, they can make money off of the crop itself.  The maze pattern changes every year, and you can see aerial photos of past designs on their website.

Beginning the first weekend in October, the maze transforms into a haunted Field of Screams on Friday and Saturday nights until Halloween.  Admission is $2 extra those days.

A portion of the proceeds goes to the Heidrick Ag History Center, which owns the land that the corn maze is on.

 History 

 It would be really cool if somebody could add some of the history of Woodland Corn Maze... how it got started, who has run it and sponsored it over the various years, where it has been, etc

20051012 20:13:57 nbsp I love this corn maze. I went with my sister and a few cousins two years ago, and we had a blast. It was freaking freezing, though, so remember your coat and gloves! Users/SummerSong

20051029 01:31:14 nbsp I recommend going at night because it adds a chill to the atmosphere. Plus the admission is 9 dollars on haunted nights. Users/SimonFung

20081012 13:39:40 nbsp I tried to go last night and it was closed! Today there was a note on their website. Anyone know why they closed early this year? Bummer. Users/wormgirl

20081018 20:19:16 nbsp Woodland Corn Maze is closed for the year. We drove around looking all over for it and couldnt find it. Couple of people in town said it was closed for the year!!!! Users/h22a919

20091025 18:57:06 nbsp The website has been down for awhile, and no one is answering the phone. I called a business down the street from the location of the maze and was told it wasnt open anymore. Im really disappointed, as I was very interested in trying it. Can anyone actually confirm that it is closed, temporary or otherwise? Users/Cherim

20091025 19:11:34 nbsp From the paper and the news, it was closed due to the storm that hit a couple of weeks ago. I wanted to go too but drats. Users/KimN.

20091026 10:58:31 nbsp I was hearing all over that the Dixon maze closed after the storm, but never heard this about the Woodland maze. But I suppose if the weather took it one, it probably took out the other. Users/AmLin

20091026 12:47:11 nbsp The Dixon maze was excellent this year. Unfortunately, like the Woodland maze, it was closed for the year because of the storm. See http://www.coolpatchpumpkins.com/ for details. Users/IDoNotExist
