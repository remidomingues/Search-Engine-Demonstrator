The Woodland Davis Clean Water Agenc (WDCWA) is a joint powers (intergovernmental) agency set up to govern the development and management of a supply of surface water from the Sacramento River to replace much or all of the groundwater used by Davis and Woodland for their municipal water supplies.
On behalf of those cities, the WDCWA has negotiated permanent, senior water rights for river water from the Conaway Ranch. The water rights permit was approved by the State Department of Water Resources on March 1, 2011. Construction of the water project is expected to begin in 2014, with river water available in 2016

The project will replace Davis groundwater, which is high in salinity and taste, with surface water from the Sacramento River. http://www.wdcwa.com/ is their website.
