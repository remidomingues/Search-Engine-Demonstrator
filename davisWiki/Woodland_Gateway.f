 History 

Original concept and preliminary planing for the Woodland Gateway commenced in 2004 (or possibly earlier).  On 23 May 2006, the Woodland City Council approved the Woodland Gateway project by unanimous vote.  Construction officially began in a groundbreaking ceremony on 27 April 2007, and spaces were available for lease beginning in the Spring of 2008.  Costco was the first business to be completed and opened February 22nd, 2008, with Target opening on July 24th, 2008.  Construction has begun on a handful of buildings, including those housing Best Buy, Michaels, and Red Robin.

 Controversies 

Like most major development projects, Woodland Gateway has been the subject of several controversies throughout the planning and construction phases.  Some of these controversies include:

 Decreased Development Fees 

 Environmental Impact Report 

On 05 March 2005, Yolo County sued the city of Woodland for deficiencies in the Environmental Impact Report (EIR).  A major portion of the lawsuit focused on the proposed auto mall.  The lawsuit was settled in January 2006, which allowed the project to move forward, including annexation and construction.

 Best Buy Signage 

A controversy occurred over Best Buy in June of 2008, about whether they could use their signature tilting blue wedge logo.  On May 15th, the wiki:woodland:Woodland Planning Commission voted 43 to deny the request, as they wanted the Gateway stores to reflect the architectural wiki:woodland:historic downtown woodland history of downtown Woodland.  In accordance with the Gateway Shopping Center historical design requirements, the new Target store put their circular logo in a brick tower.  According to the wiki:woodland:Woodland Journal and Petrovich Development, Best Buy is the cotenant needed to satisfy the conditions of other leases such as Old Navy, Sport’s Chalet, InNOut Burger, Red Robin, Bed Bath and Beyond, Michael’s, Texas Roadhouse and Johnny Carinos Italian RestaurantFootnote(Woodland Journal http://www.woodlandjournal.com/search?qbest+buy).  On June 10th, the wiki:woodland:Woodland City Council voted 50 to approve an exception to the citys historical standard.

 Development Schedule 

Phase I: Costco, target, anchors, pads, shops
Phase II: Retail, Auto Mall, Hotels (Estimated Completion: 2009)

Woodland Gateway is a 55 acre shopping centers retail center, including 525,000 square feet of shopping space, currently under construction in east Woodland at County Road 102 and Interstate 5 by Paul Petrovich Petrovich Development Co.  Originally slated to include an auto mall, lack of local dealership interest in relocating and the allure of higher sales tax revenue from large retailers convinced the city council to reassign the land to 100% retail and attract more big box stores. This includes Costco, Target (who will move from its current location at County Fair Mall), Old Navy, Shoe Pavilion, Michaels Arts and Crafts, InNOut Burger, and others.Footnote(Fok, Shawbong. Costco favored over autos by council. The Daily Democrat. 20050707.) Footnote(Wilkinson, David. Gateway: a blueprint for the future? The Davis Enterprise. 20050130.)

The Woodland City Council has received criticism for yielding so easily to Paul Petrovich Petrovichs demand for lower development fees (used by the city to build infrastructure). The fee was cut from $23/sq.ft. to $12/sq.ft after Petrovich stated that he could not continue the project at that price, which would mean that Costco would likely not build in Woodland. The fee was raised to $23 earlier from $11.42.Footnote(Panzich , Vicky and Hamilton, John P. Letter: Costcos good and bad news. The Daily Democrat. 20050803.) Yolo County has also expressed concerns with the tax revenue sharing  the county would receive 56.1% of property taxes and 0% of sales tax  and the lack of mitigation for the loss of 77 acres of prime farmland.Footnote(Yolo County. http://www.yolocounty.org/docs/press/GatewayAuto.htm Press Release: County Challenges Woodlands Environmental Impact Report. 20050304.)

A survey taken in January 2005 of 3,000 residents showed that 60% supported the Gateway project, with Costco topping the list of desired stores 3 to 1 over the next choice.Footnote(Fok, Shawbong. Costco favored over autos by council. The Daily Democrat. 20050707.)

On May 23, 2006, the Woodland city council unanimously approved the project. Infrastructure construction began around April 2007, and the official groundbreaking ceremony took place on April 27, 2007.  Costco is expected to open February 22, 2008.Footnote(The Woodland Journal http://www.woodlandjournal.com/2008/01/countdowntocostco.html Countdown to Costco 20080116) Target is slated to open in March 8, 2008.Footnote(Lee, Crystal http://www.dailydemocrat.com/ci_5774394 New ground broken at ceremony for Woodlands Gateway project 20070428)

 Yolo County Lawsuit 

On March 5, 2005, Yolo County http://www.yolocounty.org/docs/press/GatewayAuto.htm sued the city over environmental concerns with the center. Frank Sieferman, Jr. of the Yolo County Board of Supervisors issued a http://www.yolocounty.org/org/bos/sieferman/20050523Statement.pdf statement regarding the lawsuit. Note that this lawsuit is over the Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the original auto mall  a new one is being prepared for the retail center.

The lawsuit was settled in early January 2006, allowing annexation and construction to proceed. Any issues the county had with the original EIR are to be resolved in the new supplemental EIR. There was no financial deal involved in the settlement aside from splitting the litigation costs.Footnote(Sherwin, Elisabeth. County ends objection to Gateway shopping center. The Davis Enterprise. 20060103.)



20070411 20:24:50 nbsp Anyone know if construction actually began last month? Users/DavidGrundler

20070712 10:15:06 nbsp Not 100% sure when they broke ground but driving by there looks like a lot of ground work being done. Have yet to see actual construction.  Users/Vajeni

20070729 17:29:15 nbsp Although country road 102 is one of the widest, including a designated bicycle lane, does anybody know if there will be any work done to it to provide for the extra traffic? I ride this road to school twice a week and it would be nice to have a separate bike path because of the high speed cars flying by.   Users/MischaGushiken

20080319 13:39:35 nbsp The Costco is done and it looks nice. There is another large structure that looks to be near completion and I assume its the Target. Seems like nothing else has begun construction though Users/quadshock
