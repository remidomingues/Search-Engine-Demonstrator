20070502 16:49:58 nbsp My family has been going to WHCDavis ever since we relocated to Davis.  I have nothing but good things to say about this medical group.  The doctors and staff are fantastic. Users/DavidGrundler

20070905 09:58:45 nbsp Ill second the previous comment.  Ive been going there for 7 or 8 years and have seen both Dr. Mould and Dr. Ewens.  Both are excellent doctors who really go the extra mile for their patients.  Im always able to get an appointment quickly, wait times are short, and they have a stateoftheart computer system with terminals in every exam room (so they can look up your medical history, order tests, etc). Allinall, a top notch facility with top notch people. Users/MichaelMacIntosh

20070926 19:38:11 nbsp I love my new doctor, Dr. Khasimudden. He is young, funny, extremely bright and knows his stuff. I highly recommend him to anyone  short wait times also )I also had the unfortunate experience of meeting a work comp doctor named Dr. Isakari. I absolutely despise her. She is mean to everyone and yells at her nurses in front of patients. Stay away from this crazy woman if you have workmens comp. She is a waste of time (45 mins in the waiting room)and lets you have no time to answer questions and your own opinion is useless because she is (of course) always right.  Users/LizKelly

20071022 08:43:09 nbsp I agree with the previous comments with exception of what was said about Mark Ewans. My husband went to him 2 years ago with an extremely high fever (104.5) and intense stomach pain. He didnt even examine my husband and sent him home saying that if he continued to have a fever for 3 more days to come back to the office. We had already told him that my husband was sick with an increasing fever for about a week to which he said it was the flu. Come to find out my husband had  appendicitis. He went in for emergency surgery the next day...I know that mistakes can be made, but the fact that the DR. didnt even bother to examine my husband is what is making us avoiding seeing Ewans for other issues. Everyone else has always been great especially Vivian Walker!

20071216 22:42:48 nbsp I was shocked to see a very similar problem as I had with Dr. Mark Ewens.  I went to see him for pain in my right side several times.  He said it had to be muscle related.  I told him all my symptoms and he sent me to a rehab place even though I didnt believe it was muscular.  Well, to make a long story short...I went to another doctor (Dr. Jyoti Saxena) after continuing to see him for months with horrible pain.  Dr. Saxena did basic blood work and found out that all this horrible pain was due to my gall bladder.  I ended up having it removed and that solved the problem.  I will NEVER go see Dr. Ewens again.  However, I love Dr. Saxena and NP Walker.   Users/ChristinaS.

20080724 15:01:39 nbsp I have been a patient at WHC since 2002, and they are simply the best.  My wife and I have had nothing but good experiences with Dr. Ewens and Dr. Mould, and my kids love Dr. Nowicki and Dr. Petersen.  I see some other comments about Dr. Ewens which are troubling, but my experience has been the exact opposite.  For me, he has been more than thorough when I have come in to see him. Users/DavidGrundler

20080819 17:42:11 nbsp I have had nothing but a good experience with Dr. Isikari.  She is very thorough and caring.  Definitely one of the better worker comp doctors in the area and much better than my normal primary care doc!    Users/slt

20080904 15:15:34 nbsp I love this office.  Not only is Dr. Mould awesome, caring, and a great listener, but the office is just so together and competent.  I have never had to wait more than a day to get an appointment, and Ive never waited more than 15 minutes to see the doctor (and Dr. Mould APOLOGIZED for it...in most offices, 15 minutes is QUICK).  I also love the fact that they have imaging and lab services onsite.  I have gone in for an injury, been xrayed, had the xray reviewed by the doctor, and been set up in a sling within an hours time.  I also love that they send over prescriptions electronically, so I never have to carry over the piece of paper and wait at my pharmacy...they send it over, and I head over 2 hours later to pick it up..its standing by, waiting for me.

I feel so fortunate I stumbled onto this office when looking for a doctor...I cant imagine being happier. Users/AmandaCaudle

20090217 12:19:42 nbsp Lately Ive had nothing but problems with WHC and will be switching to another clinic. The Davis office in particular billed my insurance for services they could not render: I went in for some bloodwork, the lab tech wasnt able to find a vein and I was told to come back in on Monday (after having just wasted 2.5 hours of my time, in the empty waiting room).  As this was on top of several other scheduling mishaps and billing mistakes, I never went back.  Dr Turkot was great, however I cant put up with WHC and its laughable administration and billing departments.  Users/ChrisThompson

20090716 10:16:43 nbsp I have had nothing but good experiences here. Im always respected as a valued patient and the wait is never too long. Users/LauraKaroly

20101023 14:42:45 nbsp I have been generally pleased with the service in this place and also with the Woodland Hospital. Waiting times are minimal, appointment hours are flexible  and often available within a week or two, and I have had the opportunity to use their afterhour’s emergency services a few times. The latter can be a relief for parents of young children that, out of nothing, get hurt, come up with a fiver or have an allergic reaction. My son and I have seen Mark Ewans for a few years now, and we are very pleased. He is a great doctor and even has a sense of humor.   Lab tests usually come back quickly. I also love that they send over prescriptions electronically, and are quick to renew refills when the pharmacy requests them on my behalf.  Users/AlessandraRung

20110613 16:02:42 nbsp Dr. Pamela Petersen has been our trusted pediatrician for five years now.  She has given exemplary care to our two small children.  She takes the time to answer questions thoroughly and most of the time anticipates what they will be before I have to say anything, which is helpful when the children are listening.  She responds quickly to urgent after hours telephone calls and always sets our minds at ease.  She is thorough and well respected by patients and colleagues alike.  Dr. Petersen has a cheerful and direct manner of speaking to children.  She truly is a seasoned professional.  I would say she has gone above and beyond the call of duty on many occasions.  Her nurse is just fantastic!  The one unfortunate issue with WHC is their call center, which can be an absolute nightmare to deal with.  Once you get through, the Davis office staff is professional and helpful and the wait times are minimal.  To avoid the call center, I make future appointments before leaving.  We recommend Dr. Petersen and WHC Davis without reservation. Users/MrsC

20110906 18:07:22 nbsp Too bad: I was told that Dr. petersen is leaving when I was making an appointment for my son. For everything else I always try to see Vivian Walker, shes the best! Users/jsbmeb

20120320 12:35:43 nbsp I went to this clinic in Davis for the first time and found it to be excellent. Dont want to go into details, but it was significantly better than UCDMC or Sutter.
I second Vivian Walker.  Users/YogaBhoga

20120619 10:56:13 nbsp My family goes to WHC  Davis. And now even my extended family. Dr. Mould is GREAT. He listens and explains. Vivian Walker is also the best, been seeing her for over 10 years if not more. She has retired.  I highly recommend this place. They have taken care of my family, my children, spouse, parents and in laws. Users/Lisa530

20130915 05:51:38 nbsp Most of the original doctors have left this place in the past year.  A few good ones like Drs Mould, Ewens, Isakari, and Glatter still remains, but there are a bunch of new docs fresh out of training.  Wait times are good and some of the staff do speak spanish.
