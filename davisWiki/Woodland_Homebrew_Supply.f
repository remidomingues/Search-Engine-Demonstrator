Woodland Homebrew Supply has all of the equipment, supplies and ingredients to fit the needs of Davis homebrewers.  They are the closest supplier, located up 113 in Woodland. They also offer homebrewing classes. Classes are typically held the first Saturday of every month, and alternate between instructional allgrain brewing and instructional extract brewing. Check out their website for more details.

The Black Dragon Brewery, at the same location, is opening on September 6th. The brewery will offer 16 beers on tap as well as pub food.








20120608 14:47:42 nbsp Are they going to provide winemaking supplies too? Also why 16 beers? Is that the number of taps  or the number of different brews made? Users/MikeyCrews
  Ive seen wine bottles and yeasts; you could call about other supplies. Users/BrianNeal

20120610 22:12:06 nbsp Jason is an incredibly knowledgeable and talented brewer! I had the privilege of living next door to him one year in Woodland, during which I tried a lot of amazing beer. Hes got a passion for home brewing, and he loves sharing that knowledge, whether its your first batch or your hundredth. Ive found everything Ive been looking for at the shop for brewing beer and cider, and I believe they can special order just about anything else youd need for any fermentation. Users/BrianNeal

20121027 13:51:14 nbsp This seems to be the only place in the area where you can get CO2 tanks swapped and/or refilled on the weekend (they swap).  I made at least 20 calls to the usual suspects (gas supply, restaurant supply, fire safety equipment supply, etc.) between Vacaville and Sacramento before thinking to try Woodland Homebrew Supply.  Time to roll over there... whichll be fun, since I havent checked out Black Dragon Brewery yet! Users/TomGarberson
