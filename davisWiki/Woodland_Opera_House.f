The Woodland Opera House Theatre was originally built in 1885, burned down in 1892, rebuilt in 1896 and closed in 1913.  Restoration efforts began in 1981 and it was reopened as a performance venue in 1989.  It is a http://ohp.parks.ca.gov/?page_id21536 California State Historic Landmark and is listed in the http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/ca/Yolo/state.html National Register of Historical Places.

The popular http://www.wohtheatre.org/ypt.htm Young Peoples Theatre program at the Opera House offers afterschool and summer classes in theatre arts, dance and voice for children and teens.

The Opera House is said to be haunted, and the story is featured in a number of different books on the subject.  The ghost is supposedly that of a fireman who was killed during the 1892 fire that destroyed the original building and much of downtown Woodland.  A burning wall collapsed on him during the fire, and the area where he is believed to have died is apparently the hot spot of the supernatural activity.
