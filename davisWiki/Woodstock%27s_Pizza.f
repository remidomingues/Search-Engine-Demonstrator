>As of 5/14/2012, Woodstocks of Davis has a full bar, a ton of new staff members comprised of friendly faces from around town, and a new schedule for events and Happy Hour.<
Woodstocks Pizza has to be the most popular pizza joint in Davis.  Besides decent pizza, their menu offers salads, chicken wings, and frosted CinnaBread. For us health nuts they also offer a wholewheat crust at no additional cost. Sadly, its not uncommon for the folded over portion of the crust to take about as much surface area as the cheese.

Woodstocks is generally loud and full of life. Open late, they offer free WiFi Hot Spots wireless as well as free refills. Combined with the fact they also now have a full bar, this makes Woodstocks, Original Steves, and Lamppost Pizza the only places in Davis where you can surf the web, drink a beer, and eat pizza.

Happy Hour: 36 PM $1.00 off all beers, wells, and appetizers
Delivery costs $2.75 plus tip ($4$7 is considered a good tip). Theyll even deliver to campus. The driver will call you up when they get there so you dont have to wait outside. If you want to pay for delivery using a credit card, they now ask for your credit card number and expiration date over the telephone. The safety of this measure may seem sketchy, but its likely safer than their previous atthedoor, carboncopying method.

On a side note, Woodstocks Pizza also has six other locations in California: San Diego, Santa Barbara, Irvine, Santa Cruz,  San Luis Obispo, and wiki:Chico:Woodstocks Pizza Chico.  An interesting fact, in Santa Barbara they change the name of their beloved pizza from Causeway Classic to IV Classic (IV stands for Isla Vista, the collegiate equivalent of a cesspool located adjacent to the UCSB campus). Actually, each of the locations of Woodstocks Pizza has its own name for the classic pizza San Diego Aztec Classic, Santa Cruz Cruz Classic, San Luis Obispo SLO Classic, etc.

Events
Woodstocks holds several different events at their bar on a weekly basis. They include:

Trivia Night: On Thursday nights, Trivia Nights are hosted by Mick and Thomas. Admission is free, and event starts at 9 PM but usually fills up so get there early! Prizes are given out to winners of each round, as well as the overall winner. Its technically an all ages trivia event, but if youre under 21 your team is forced to sit in the upstairs balcony area, which can be somewhat inconvenient.

Live Music Saturdays: Featuring a different artist each week. Bar Specials also available.

Woodstocks events are almost always free, and are almost always ALL AGES! Since Woodstocks uses wristbands rather than carding at the door, the under21 crowd is always welcome here. Obviously, you have to be 21 to buy alcohol, but you will never be turned away from an event at the bar just because youre not 21 before 10pm. Now that they have a full bar, the bar side of the establishment becomes 21+ only at 10 pm daily. That being said, they are very strict about underage drinking and will not hesitate to remove you and your entire group immediately if you are caught providing to a minor, not to mention notifying the police if you happen to be caught doing so. Liquor licenses are hard to come by in Davis and Woodstocks doesnt mess around with theirs!

 History 
Woodstocks was not always the size it is now. In the older righthand side, the main eating area used to be raised about a foot above the regular floor. Woodstocks bought the property and remodeled. Previously, it was The Velvet Elvis, a bar opened by a few people, including Seth Sternin, one of the current owners of Ground Zero. It closed primarily because of restricted hours that prevented them from serving alcohol after 11pm, making it a tough investment.  Soon after opening, one of Ground Zeros competitors moved from its prominent location in Sacramento (SBI) and the people interested in starting up Ground Zero were offered the lease. It was only possible for Sternin to take up the lease by freeing up his capital to invest in the new location, therefore leaving Velvet Elvis while his partners sold off to a buyer, who never reopened. In addition to the Davis Ground Zero which apparently opened later, the Sacramento location opened in midyear and still exists today on Arden Way.

Before it was The Velvet Elvis, it was The Library. Before The Library existed, the northern end was occupied by The Club.  The southern end held Honorable Gees, a Chinese restaurant. Before Honorable Gees existed, the southern end held The Spudnut Coffee Shop. Before Spudnut, it was the Sacramento Cafe. With the exception of the demolition of the wall between the northern and southern ends, the basic structure of the southern half is essentially the same as when it was the Sacramento Cafe of the 1920s through 1940s.

20100121 20:12:07 nbsp If you live or visit Davis its definately worth going here once.  That said, I dont know if Id ever be willing to go here often or as my regular pizza place.  The pizza is a bit on the pricy side and is also not really any better than chain pizza, sadly.  While I love local business, my taste buds say stick with Mountain Mikes over Woodstocks for pure taste.

That said, Woodstocks is a fun place to go with friends to hand out and drink and the same cannot be said of any chain pizza joint.  Is it a better bar that serves pizza than it is a pizza place?  Maybe. Users/rfrazier

20100314 22:47:38 nbsp Their insert town here special is the same for every college town.

Hey everyone  look at that phony! Users/upisdown

20100314 23:02:24 nbsp I heard that Woodstocks had some of the best pizza in Davis, so when I finally tried some I was disappointed. The crust is about the flavor and texture of cardboard and the sauce isnt very good.

I also wanted to point out to the commenter that referred to Woodstocks as a local business that Woodstocks is actually a small chain based out of San Diego. (See http://woodstocksca.com/aboutus/contactus.html for all their chain locations.) I guess theyre better than Dominos, but I wouldnt say much better.

My advice is try Lamppost Pizza instead. (I still havent tried Steves or Village Bakery.) Users/gynomight
  It should be noted that Users/gynomight and users/upisdown share the same IP address, which strongly implies the above two reviews were left from the same computer.
  Actually that is not what should be noted. It only implies that it came from the same router which was assigned the WAN IP from the ISP. Assuming that each person has their own IP or even computer shows a misunderstanding of network technology. Most people in home networks connect through routers now which do NAT http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation processing. This major step in networking technology prevented the internet from running out of IP addresses early in its development. Cheers!

20100325 14:49:43 nbsp Im surprised to read so many negative comments here. First, I must admit that I am an employee of the restaurant, so I am obviously a little bit biased. As far as the quality/taste of the pizza is concerned, everyone will have their own personal tastes and I cant blame anyone for not liking the food. I personally think it is great pizza, but that doesnt mean everyone will love it. What I am surprised about is the comments about the staff and service. Woodstocks employees work very hard to please their customers, and will not hesitate to correct mistakes of any kind. We truly believe that the customer is always right, and if you have a problem, we will listen and correct it. Obviously, we are human, and not everything will be perfect all the time. But with that in mind, and with a good attitude and reasonable approach toward reality, you will find that our service cant be beat. Yes, if you come in on Friday night and the line is out the door, your food will probably take a long time to get to you. Yes, if you live in the dorms and give the wrong phone number when you order, or you dont get reception in your building, your order will definitely not make it to you until you call us back; how else are we supposed to get ahold of you? The point isnt that were perfect. Its that, when we are imperfect, and you take the time to respectfully tell us that, we WILL do absolutely everything within reason to fix that problem and turn you into a happy customer. The last thing anyone at Woodstocks wants is for you to have a bad experience, so if you have an issue, like the many people who have commented here, please give us a chance to fix it before totally blasting us over it. You will most likely find that everything can turn out just fine with good communication, a good attitude, and reasonable expectations. Thanks to all who patronize our store, and to those who no longer do, I encourage you to give us another shot! Users/AlexHall

20100325 17:01:47 nbsp This place and Village are the only two local pizza joints in town that I will order from. The food is always fresh and the quality top notch.
The first time that I ever went in I was treated very rudely but after running into the owner I gave them a second shot and am happy that I did. Hands down one of the top 3 pizzas in town. Users/JoeRandom

20100413 12:26:00 Woodstocks Pizza is the best place to order pizza!  My family loves the pizza so much.  We especially like how the pizza crust is filled with sauce. I recommend this place to anyone who loves great pizza and wonderful service.  Giovanni Janzen

20100513 14:03:01 nbsp I have a question about the picture with the Psalm: Where is this news story about atheists boycotting Woodstocks? Id never heard that. Users/Shiva

20100602 12:37:41 nbsp Woodstocks Pizza isnt that badits not the greatest as some will attest, but its on my top choice of whom to order from when in Davis. A bit pricey, considering you can get some pretty cheap pizzas elsewhere. My hugest gripe with Woodstocks is their karaoke. Ive been here a few times and have come early in order to get in a song or two, but the karaoke DJ is pretty horrible. I went on a pretty slow summer night, where there were only a few singers in front of me, which prompted me to think that I could get my chance in under an hour. That didnt happen, unfortunately. The DJs friends who sat at the table with her (I remember two girls distinctively) went an alarming four times went on before I had a chance to sing my one. Blatant favoritism? Definitely. I went again later that summer and had the same experience.  Users/BreeButler

               Im sorry you had that experience. I do a rotation throughout the night and try to give everybody a turn. I highly doubt that I put somebody up 4 times before I put you up once,  but I could be wrong. It also may seem like there a few people ahead of you, but it never hurts to ask where you are in line :) Come by some time! Users/DamarisTobar


20100610 11:19:15 nbsp LOVE THE STAFF! awesome pizza.  good beer.  great atmosphere. Users/MissAmyLu

20100613 00:53:40 nbsp me and my friend used to order late at night to grub here. but seriously, the crust gives my jaw a workout. its also very pricey...i would rather get the $5 at Ceasers. the atmosphere looks quite relaxing though: a nice tv up front, music, and puff the magic dragon(the mascot) watching over us. Users/binladen

20100702 16:27:15 nbsp Hey there, I just wanted to stop by to say that Ive been to Woodstocks a couple of times lately, and I found the service to be courteous and attentive and professional.  I was very impressed. Users/drpottsiv

20100702 17:01:44 nbsp I would say this is the best tasting pizza in davis Users/smartgirl

20100716 17:36:56 nbsp I think this is the worst pizza in Davis.  Users/JasperD

20100918 11:09:00 nbsp Good pizza, very good beer selection and GREAT customer service, even on supercrowded Friday nights.  Users/JulieCross

20110206 17:52:54 nbsp I only go here for the slice pizzas, staff is really nice Users/NikhilDahal

20110324 13:35:17 nbsp I havent gone here since my friend was assaulted by one of the employees last year. Because theres a bar, Ill explain that there was no drink involved (for moral reasons, he wont touch the stuff). He had put down his stuff and gone to order pizza (so was standing near the door), one of the employees asked him to leave due to his clothing, he was annoyed, but he went to get his stuff. The employee suddenly shoved him INTO the door and out and slammed the door in his face. I was almost hit too by my friend as he was being shoved towards me. I was shocked by the sudden violence and almost called the police (I would have if it had escalated). Admittedly, I dont know if the employee was a bouncer or at what level theyre allowed to physically assault patrons into leaving, but it seemed like since he was quietly going to get his stuff and leave, it went way too far. If this was illegal (and again, I dont know if it is or not), Woodstocks really needs to look into it. Users/Ravyn

20110328 19:16:47 nbsp People need to not steal/lose the boardgame pieces.  Otherwise its a fave. Users/ALo

20110407 17:29:53 nbsp I love this place. Woodstock has some of the best employees in Davis. They are always very nice and all of the laugh at my lame jokes. I know theyre lame, they know that theyre lame, but they laugh anyway. Thats how nice they are. Top notch. Users/Dozer

20110410 00:04:50 nbsp Woodstock pizza satiates my latenight cravings again: At 11:09 PM, Jonathan took my phone order for delivery of a 16 Xlarge Davis Classic with thin crust on white bread (pepperoni, sausage, black olives, mushrooms, onions and extra cheese)  normally a $22.99 pie, but I had an email coupon for $5.00 off. Adding in an order of 12piece buffalo wings for $7.99, after tax and delivery, my total was $30.69. Jonathan said that it was busy night, so he thought itd take about 45 minutes to 1 hour before my delivery, which was no problem for me (I wasnt going anywhere tonight).

I hung up the phone at 11:15 PM but at 11:51 PM, the driver called and was outside my door. Impressed with the prompt service (36 minute turn around before midnight), I gave the driver a $5.00 tip.

Now thats how a vendor successfully manages customer expectation. Users/T.Zukumori


Thanks T. Zukumori!

20110410 16:16:52 nbsp Im surprised so many people think this is the best pizza in Davis. The crust tastes like cardboard IMO.

My favorite part of Woodstocks is the trivia night. I love when the category involves music, such as playing a theme song and you have to name the TV show. My main problem with trivia is they need to ask the questions at a faster pace. I start out not minding, but halfway through it really gets to be a drag. It seems like forever in between each question and even if they cut off one minute of answering time for each question we could actually be out before midnight. Some of us have places (work/school) to be the next morning... Users/MeggoWaffle

     Thanks for your comments, Meggo! Youre not the first person who has complained about the slow pace of the game, so I will make an extra effort to speed it up in the future. I usually try to be done by 11:0011:15, but sometimes it runs a little over (like a couple weeks ago when there were 26 teams, which Im assuming is the long night you were referring to!). Ill also try to come up with a music round soon  I think those are the most fun ones too! users/AlexHall
            Yeah, I was there that night with a ton of teams. Ive been to Woodstocks trivia about five or six times total over the past several months and it seemed to go late each time, so maybe Im just unlucky... Users/MeggoWaffle

20110502 18:51:16 nbsp I dont suggest using the pin ball machines. Users/Graveflower

20110615 21:19:37 nbsp Got a pizza delivered to my place this afternoon, and the guy who took the order was very friendly. I had eaten here before, but forgot the name of the pizza I wanted. I named off the two ingredients (jalepeno and chicken) and he automatically told me the name of the pizza (it was called the Firebird). I ended up ordering an extra large Firebird pizza and he told me it would take 3035 minutes.

I had a student discount coupon that I forgot to mention on the phone and I called Woodstocks back, and someone else answered and informed me that the pizza was already on the way. But to tell the driver that when he arrived to my place, for him to call back to verify  the price change. By the time the pizza came, I told the driver (who ended up being the guy who took my phone order) about the changes, and he was very courteous and told me it was no problem about the latecoupon, and that Woodstocks had already called him.

I applaud to Woodstocks for being very professional today, and to the driver for being really courteous.

Even when I go to Woodstocks in the evenings, the staff is always friendly.

20120206 20:12:53 nbsp The all meat orgy pizza and cinnabread are quite tasty :) The pizza could use a bit more sauce, though. Users/LoriOrf

20120223 12:53:00 nbsp I unsubscribed from P.I.E. in 2008. Recently, I started getting spam directed at the email address I created only for Woodstocks. Are they selling their address list? Anyone else getting this junk?

  I do the same thing you do.  I also unsubscribed awhile back.  If anything comes into that address, Ill let you know.  So far, nothing has. ⁓Users/JabberWokky ʝ⍵

20120316 06:25:55 nbsp I cannot figure out why there is so much hype for this place. I have not found a pizza that I actually find enjoyable. I have been here multiple occasions with friends and the problems with the pizza are usually that they are covered in so much grease that it feels like the pizza was deep fried. Or if you order a pizza with more than one topping; everything just falls off the pizza onto your plate leaving you with greasy dough and a mess on your plate. The only way they will get me back there is if Im with friends, even then I find it hard to believe that I will touch their pizza again. Users/HGibson

20120328 18:31:51 nbsp im not a fan of their pizza at all, but occassionally enjoy their cinnabreads. Users/SaThai

20140118 20:51:27 nbsp Had a disappointing delivery experience. Ordered a Large pepperoni and sausage pizza with an 8 cinnabread and was quoted a 45 minute delivery time (although I was TWO BLOCKS AWAY. I figured what they hey and said that was fine. When they were about 20 minutes late I gave them a call asking what was happening and they said that it was enroute and would arrive in a couple minutes. It arrived about 10 minutes later. The cheese of the pizza congealed and the cinnabread relatively cold and tasting stale as a result. I also felt like I nearly broke a molar on a bit of small bone or hard cartilage in one of my bites that had sausage in it. Wont be ordering again. Users/E.C.H.
