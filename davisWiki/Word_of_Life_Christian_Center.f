Word of Life Christian Center

Since its formation during the Jesus Movement of the1960s, Word of Life Christan Center (WLCC) has seen itself as a cutting edge church. Word of Life continues to offer the community of Davis and UCD students the opportunity to experience the love and joy of knowing and growing in a personal relationship with Jesus. With contemporary Spiritfilled worship, prayer and in depth Bible teaching, people are introduced to the grace and truth available to followers of the Lord (See http://www.daviswordoflife.org/ ).

Members of WLCC desire for Christians to love one another and work together to see the people of Davis come to Christ. A favorite Scripture of WLCC is Christs command to his disciples to, “...love one another as I have loved you. By this shall all men know that you are my disciples...” (John 13:34,35).

Since 1975 WLCC members have worked with the Good Shepherd International Fellowship, to build bridges between pastors and churches regionally and internationally. In partnership with other ministries they have sponsored crusades, pastor and youth conferences and provided humanitarian relief in Southeast Asia, Africa and countries such as the Ukraine and Georgia (See http://www.gsif.org/ ).

Pastor Arthur Defenderfer has been with the church since 1973. He understands the spiritual, emotional and academic challenges of being a student at UCD (he graduated in 1974) and being in business. After joining the church he grew spiritually and received extensive inner healing. Out of compassion from his own healing journey, he offers affordable counseling as a Marriage and Family Therapist (See http://daviscounseling.org/home.html ).
