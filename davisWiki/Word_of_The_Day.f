The word of the day is posted every weekday in the northsouth hallway at the west end of Haring Hall near the vending machines. There is even a special plastic word of the day holder designed to hold an 8.5x11 sheet of paper. It is my understanding that one guy (probably a professor in the School of Veterinary Medicine) has been posting the word of the day for years.

Some choice previous words of the day:
  ranivorous  adj. frog eating

20070227 13:46:01 nbsp No Word of the Day Today

20080322 17:09:34 nbsp The word of the day has disappeared!  Anybody know what happened to it?  I liked it. Users/MartySmith

UPDATE (10/24/2009):  The Word of the Day has been removed for quite some time.  No new words have been up for the last year or so.
