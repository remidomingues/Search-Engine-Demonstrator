The Worlds Greatest Bicycle Parade, presented by the Odd Fellows, has the goal of setting the Guinness World Record for Longest Single Line of Bicycles.

The http://www.worldsgreatestbicycleparade.com/rules.html rules include:

  All participants must be riding a bicycle, which is defined as a two wheeled vehicle powered by only pedaling. (Sorry no training wheels, unicycles, etc.  However, people with disabilities or physical limitations can register for and ride their special vehicles in the parade as long as the vehicles used are commercially available and not home made.)
  All Bicycles must travel minimum two mile route and all bicycles must cross the start line and the finish line (at the Odd Fellows Lodge).
  The bicycles must traverse the route in a single line.
  Children must be at least 7 years old to participate.

 2011 

The parade will start at 10:02 AM sharp on October 2, 2011.  Afterward (from about 11 AM  2:30 PM) there will be a festival in Central Park.  They are still seeking volunteers and bicycles bicycle riders; see the websites for details.

 2010 

The 2010 attempt began at precisely 10:03 AM on Sunday, October 3, 2010.  The goal was achieved  http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/Search/Details/Longestsinglelineofbicycles/73205.htm Guinness certified the 2010 record, with 916 cyclists. They are planning on trying to beat that record in 2011.

The Worlds Greatest Bicycle Parade was originally supposed to be an attempt to break the worlds record for the Largest Bicycle Parade, under the http://www.worldsgreatestbicycleparade.com/rules.html Guinness Rules. The record had been held by Bangkok, Thailand, at 3,515 bikes. Organizers were hoping to get more than 4,000 people to join Daviss effort. Then, http://search.davisenterprise.com/display.php?id68634 according to the Davis Enterprise, in August 2010 Davis got a big surprise: Udine, Italy, was confirmed as the new record holder in the largest parade of bicycles category with 48,615 bicycles! Knowing that Davis had very little chance of breaking that, Guinness agreed to create a brandnew Worlds Record Book category called Longest Single Line of Bicycles with a minimum count of 1,000 bikes.  However, there seems to be some confusion over which record they were originally trying to break and what the confirmed record was  see below.

Registration for the event was $10; you could register at the website linked above.  You had to register online before the event to ride in the Parade; registration was only open to the first 1,200 riders, first come, first served.  1200 riders registered well before the event itself, and registration was closed.  You could also buy a tshirt for $10 at the same time, or buy one for $15 on the day of the parade. The http://www.worldsgreatestbicycleparade.com/parade.html route started and finished downtown at the Odd Fellows Lodge on 415 2nd Street, going up F Street to 14th Street and the North Davis Elementary School parking lot, where cyclists turned and returned by the same route. The parade was expected to last approximately 20 minutes.  There was a Festival at Central Park after the Parade.  All proceeds from the event benefited the Davis Schools Foundation, ... to raise money for our cashstrapped Davis Schools.

They also http://www.worldsgreatestbicycleparade.com/volunteerinfo.html sought dozens of volunteers to help with the parade and festival, as well as sponsors (sponsors were recognized on event Tshirts and in publicity).  The Sponsor Chairman is Stewart Savage; you can email him at MailTo(ssavage AT abatonconsulting DOT com).

 Information on current world records 

Records and categories of records are a confusing business (how many fathers have Worlds Best Dad mugs?).  While Guinness has created some different categories to try and confirm various specific world records, even they seem to publish contrary numbers in some cases.  Here are some of the claims made:
  For Largest Parade of Bicycles: The record had been claimed by Bangkok, Thailand, at 3,515 bikes.  However, it is not on the Guinness Website.  (http://www.thaicycling.com/board/download/file.php?id18748&t1 link)
  For Largest Parade of Bicycles: The record for the largest parade of bicycles is 1,901 and was organised by Volvic (Taiwan) in Taipei City, Taiwan on July 21, 2007. ((http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records/travel_and_transport/bikes_and_motorbikes/largest_parade_of_bicycles.aspx Guinness Website)
  For Largest Cycling Event: While organizing the 2010 parade, Davis got a big surprise in August: Udine, Italy, was confirmed as the new record holder in the largest cycling event category with 48,615 bicycles.   This is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records 2010, however the event itself happened in 2000.  (http://books.google.com/books?idhLYzvUvPL3MC&pgPA472&lpgPA472&dqguinness+udine+italy&sourcebl&otswE52vNs0YP&sigwNXTNsCtZV2p9yvUIJEYusMvK8o&hlen&eiirWjTIuxJYX2tgOl2vD6Bg&saX&oibook_result&ctresult&resnum1&ved0CBkQ6AEwAA#vonepage&q&ffalse Guinness Book for World Records 2010)

In other words, there is some confusion on this matter. The current record (that anybody can confirm) for Largest Parade of Bicycles still remains at 1,901 as stated on the official Guinness website. The record of 3,515 would be difficult to beat, but not impossible, and maybe not even necessary as this number is not yet listed on the Guinness website. The record of 48,615 bicycles is for the Largest Cycling Event  not the Largest Bicycle Parade  see Google Book link above. It seems that the 3,515 number is real, however until somebody confirms that with the Guinness organization, its unconfirmed. The Davis Odd Fellows mentioned it http://worldsgreatestbicycleparade.com/blog/?p48 here so they probably got it directly from Guinness, so its most likely accurate, however it is still unconfirmed.




20100622 12:05:14 nbsp Sounds a lot like the Worlds Largest Bicycle Parade from a few years ago. Users/JasonAller

20100912 21:36:34 nbsp Im all for supporting schools or whatever, but wont charging $10 deter the entire student population of Davis? Users/ElisaHough

20100924 07:52:52 nbsp Longest single line of bikes?  What a cop out!  Unless the folks in Italy were riding more than 12 abreast, (not likely on Italian streets) they will still have the longest bike pack record if only the projected 4000 riders show up here.  If the organizers had any clue, they would drop the registration fee altogether, ask for donations and look for sponsors.  They would probably raise a lot more money and stand a chance at breaking a REAL record that way. Users/Chuckles

20100929 14:13:43 nbsp They got a new category added just for the world record, they charge $10 for some reason I dont understand (thereby eliminating 1000s of people who might otherwise come from all over the state), who knows where the $10 is actually going (Davis yuppie schools are already better off than almost any other schools in California  give it to some kids who actually need it, do we really need to buy bigger computer screens for their office workers for god sakes?). They dont list the time of 10:03am on the Poster OR on the Homepage  wow. They are doing this on a football Sunday  thereby eliminating 1000s of more people who might have otherwise come. They are just shooting themselves in the foot left and right. Users/GarrettGallegos
  Perhaps you were not aware of all the Davis teachers and staff members who have been pink slipped in recent years. Davis schools may be doing better than some, but they are very much in need of funds. Users/JoePomidor, originally by Users/CovertProfessor

20100929 15:06:14 nbsp Last comment for today: I adjusted the page above to reflect what I can find on Google as the current records along with their correct categories. Either I am completely confused, or the parades organizers along with Guinness are completely confused. According to the official information that my wicked research skills found (Thanks Google!), we only need to beat the record of 1,901 bicycles  not 3,515 and not 48,615. If I am wrong on this, I would VERY HAPPILY welcome the corrected information to be placed above on this page. This target number is a JOKE  Davis can beat 1,901 at lunchtime at the Silo. Knowing that Davis had very little chance of breaking that  are you kidding? Its only 4,000 bikes. Davis should try  and try again  every year until we beat that. At least having a target to beat 3,515 would be a good goal. If we cant beat this, we dont belong in the record book for ANY category  let alone a category created just for us (PS: expect Udine or Taipei to break whatever record we set anyway). This is Davis, there are sarcastically 4,000 bikes on my street alone. An effectively advertised event (with no stupid $10 entry fee) could beat 4k no problem. At the very least, aim for beating 3,515 every year until we actually beat it! Dont just put your tail between your legs and create a new category (with a maximum limit of 1200 people, less than any of the other records mentioned on this page). We might as well just create the Davis Book of World Records if we going to do it this way. Only a regular annual event that grows a bit each year could get enough people to break any of the records  even though this isnt Davis first bike parade, they need to decide on a freakin day for every year.  Users/GarrettGallegos
  The information, including the 48,615 number, was taken from the Davis Enterprise, http://search.davisenterprise.com/display.php?id68634 here (requires login).   See also http://search.davisenterprise.com/display.php?id70102 here.  Search on bike parade for more.  We are no longer trying for the greatest # of bicycles.  (For what its worth, though, I share your opinion of the silliness of creating a category just for us). Users/CovertProfessor
   Professor, if you read above I know full well that number is confirmed by Guinness, however it is NOT for the Largest Bicycle Parade category  its for the Largest Cycling Event category. In other words, we should have stuck with the Largest Bicycle Parade category. PS: I dont think spending an hour of my time correcting the blatantly wrong information on this wiki is making a mess of this page. I have kept my personal opinions in the comments, and have clarified the absolutely incorrect details previously listed here. Regardless, I took an extra minute to move my current records mess to its own subsection, hopefully this will make it look nicer.

20100929 16:40:05 nbsp It looks like the Davis Odd Fellows may have been the one to publish the 3,515 stat originally. See http://worldsgreatestbicycleparade.com/blog/?p48 here. http://www.muic.mahidol.ac.th/eventsblog/?p150 Here is a link to the event itself. It looks like it just happened in May of 2010, and http://www.thaicycling.com/board/download/file.php?id18748&t1 here is the supposed certificate. Still wondering why its not on their website  Until I see Guinness acknowledge this somewhere publicly, Im leaving above as Unconfirmed. Users/GarrettGallegos

20100929 16:42:41 nbsp PS: its been 5 months since that event, if its real  the Guinness people are really slow (do they update their website annually along with the book perhaps?). I still think 4,000 bikes is a good target for Davis, why they didnt shoot for that anyway I do not know, new category doesnt mean you should lower your goals also. Users/GarrettGallegos
