The World Cup rolls around every four years. Many people in the international and cosmopolitan town of Davis enjoy watching it. But where to do so?

World Cup 14
The games this year are at relatively reasonable times for people in our timezone: 9:00am, 12:00am, and 3:00pm for most of the group stage games.

 de Veres Irish Pub is showing all of the games, including the morning games during the week. They have two TVs: one in the front corner, and a smaller one above the corner of the bar.
 The Graduate is also showing the games, and opening at 8:30 for the morning games. They have large tvs.
 Uncle Vitos Slice of N.Y. is showing the 12 noon and 3pm games. Big tvs all around, including two over the bar.
 Village Pizza & Grill has a tv over the bar and is showing the lunchtime games.
 Barista Brew is open early, has a tv that is showing the games, and is a nice nonbar option.
 Taqueria El Burrito has a tv and seems to be showing the games.
 University of Beer has been showing the later games on the tv on their outside patio when Ive walked past the last couple of days. Perhaps not the best place if you want to seriously watch the game though.
 3rd & U Cafe has a sign in the window that says watch the world cup here!


Womens World Cup 11
The Graduate will be opening early for the morning games (9am, it sounds like).  Lamppost Pizza is a good option, since it opens 8am daily and has a special breakfast menu.  The Davis Beer Shoppe has a screen and often shows Soccer, but it wont be opening early (sob).

Where to watch the 2010 World Cup
3rd and U Cafe
Opens at 8 a.m during weekdays and has good beer deals.  Three beers for $6 if purchased during the match (Blue Moon or Ranger IPA only).

Barista Brew
Open at 7 a.m, has one screen and is a great nonbar option for those early games. Coffee at $1.29 will help wake you up until the games get exciting

The Grad

Although they charge a $5 cover, even for the 7 a.m. games, its redeemable for $5 worth of food or drink during the game.  They serve a setmenu breakfast (choice of 3: eggs, eggs, biscuits, waffles, sausage, hash browns in a warmer) starting at $6.95 and coffee at $23.  If you come with your friends, you can combine your coupons.  They have multiple screens and can play simultaneous matches.  Theres a sizable international crowd too.
  You cant really rely on their listed times for replaying matches.  On Wednesday, June 23, for example, they said they were going to replay the USAlgeria game (which was live at 7am) at 11:30 and 5.  Despite a couple of requests, though, they wouldnt show it at 11:30 on even one screen.  One employee even checked their flyer and acknowledged that it was listed at 11:30.

       — Sincere apologies for not showing the USA replay and the England replay at 11:30am. It was not because we refused to show it, I ran out of room on the DVRs that have been recording every match daily. We are (and will continue to) showing replays every day, but I made the mistake and I apologize. If we had it recorded, out of all matches we replayed, that definitely would be the one. — Dstaf

      — We will continue to support Soccer fans when world cup is over. We will be open at 7AM on Saturday August 14th for opening day of the English Premier League and also show most UEFA Champions League games via Fox Soccer Channel, Fox Soccer Plus, GolTV, ESPN3 & many other soccer friendly feeds. — Dstaf
