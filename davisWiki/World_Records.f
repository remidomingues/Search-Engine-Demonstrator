Records to Break/Planning

Its readily apparent that Davis has a large population of people willing to get together and do silly things. We should try and find more records and break them, making 2007 the year of record breaking. Perhaps we can break the most records in one town in one year. Someone should go fetch a copy of the http://www.amazon.com/GuinnessWorldRecords2007/dp/1904994121/refpd_bbs_2/10312159935798215?ieUTF8&sbooks&qid1172997729&sr82 Guinness Book of World Records and find some good ones. The website is incomplete, but the http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records/amazing_feats/mass_participation/largest_wobble_board_ensemble.aspx worlds largest wobble board ensemble looks easy enough.

Where can we procure 400 wobble boards?  Users/StevenDaubert
  Given that you cannot buy them anyway, we can just make them ... just need a good deal of thin masonite or hardwood. ~Users/DavidPoole davepoole
  Metal or cardboard (not corrugated) will work to. I think the easiest way to do this wobble board ensamble is to have a bunch of boards that are ether going to be used for something, or boards that are the waste product of something. Users/ArlenAbraham
  Then keep your eyes peeled gents, so we can show those aussies what for. ~Users/DavidPoole DavePoole

Worlds Largest Simultaneous Dance?
I just found about about http://www.thrilltheworld.com/ Thrill The World which hopes to get in the Guinness Book of World Records for the largest simultaneous dance of Michael Jacksons Thriller. It is set for October 27, 2007. They are encouraging people to host an event, and I figured maybe some Davisites might want to participate. The website has written instructions/choreography and there are video instructions on YouTube as well. Thoughts? Users/EmmyMelton
