This page commemorates the fact that in Davis, World Water Day 2005 was wet.  Extremely wet.  This suggests the worlds water supply is in good hands.  I, for one, welcome our new waterlogged masters.

Northern California Northern Californians traditionally complain about Southern California Southern Californians on this day. While the out of state students rest of the world complains about http://state.ca.us Californias water usage. Kidding :o)
