Bodies slamming into each other, a sport of pure power and explosive, directed and finely honed energy, wrestling may be one of the older activities in history.  Two people, matched without weapons and rules to keep it (relatively) safe, trying to pin their opponent down.  Within Davis, it can be found at various locations, usually academic.  Some local schools have teams, including Davis High School whose team is coached by Ty Brown.  At UC Davis, mats (and presumably people using them) can be found at Hickey Gym. Urijah Faber wrestled for and was a coach at UCD.

There is also the theatrical stage form of wrestling, known as WWE pro wrestling, and wrestling as a form of sex foreplay.
