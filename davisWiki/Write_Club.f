Users/RobRoy started Write Club early in the year 2003. It lasted for a year before the university shut it down after a poetry reading that offended some people. The irony was that the poetry reading was not a Write Club event but rather an Art opening that happened to have a few Write Club members. The cops shut it down all because someone said the word fuck. To quote the curator of the MU Art Gallery (which is on the second floor) Language has no place in poetry. Who knows what that means but it certainly shows that the art department on campus is a bit contradictory.

The purpose of Write Club was to provide a forum for people who were interested in performing self written literary works. The organization boasted almost a hundred members.

20050506 16:48:20 nbsp hey anyone interested in starting up something similar again? it can definetly be underground weve been doing the open mic night circuit in davis and sac, and its entirely possible to maybe even come up with a literary mag of some type.  Users/JillBenciWoodward
   I think it would be awesome to start again, but if you were wise you wouldnt attach Write Clubs name to it in any way because SPAC isnt a big fan and Club Finance Council probably wouldnt help out with money.  Users/KristenBirdsall
    Of course if someone wants to be on the CFC board, it would make getting money much easier.  Its also possible to petition ASUCD and their Academic Affairs Commission.  Users/BrentLaabs
