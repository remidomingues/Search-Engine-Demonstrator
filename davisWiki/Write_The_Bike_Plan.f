Help Write the new Davis Bike Plan

The Davis Bike Plan dictates future planning and policy for bicycles in the city.  The plan was updated in 1991 and 2001, and is due for a revision in 2007.  The plan must be filed with the state by November, 2007 for projects to be eligible for funding from SACOG funds.

Public Works staff and the citys Bicycle Advisory Commission have been compiling a list of suggested plan components from the public, posted below.

As the city is shortstaffed at present, the bicycle advocacy group Davis Bicycles! is assisting the city by inviting members of the public to write a 2 page briefing about any components of the plan that they feel particularly passionate or knowledgeable about.

Davis Bicycles! had an Bike Plan brainstorming meeting on July 23, 2007.  25 people were in attendance, and participants collectively volunteered to write about 40 of the plan elements.  Those that were not able to attend the meeting are invited to review the list below, and adopt one or more issues to write a 1  3 page summary of the issues in the following format:

After a component is written up, it will look something like this

Notes on quality issues:
We are just coming up with ideas that we think will work.  They should be sensible and legal, but otherwise we are welcome to come up with whatever innovative ideas that we can think of.  That said, the more conventional the idea, the easier it will be to get it into the plan.  So dont be shy, dont worry if you cant write up an entire document, if you just want to pick at topic and write up as much as you can, it will be a good start.

Timing:
Ken Celli is the Editor In Chief of the project, and he is relatively free until August 1st, when he starts a new assignment.  Since it only takes an hour or two to write up most of the components, we are asking people to contribute by Friday July 27 if at all possible.  Otherwise, but Friday, Aug 2 for the second round (Ken wasnt really planning to do anything that weekend anyway :^))

So, choose a topic you have an interest in, and write about it.  If you can take a photo or two of good or bad policy or planning, great. Downloading photos from google maps is good too.

city vehicles, most notoriously the police and occasionally parks and rec love to drive heavy vehicles on the bike paths that specifically nix that, and I can think of several bike paths that could use a genuine resurface. Talk to me Ted... Oh P.S. I like the red abandoned bike tag the best, it catches the eye and conveys the gravity of the situation  Users/StevenDaubert
