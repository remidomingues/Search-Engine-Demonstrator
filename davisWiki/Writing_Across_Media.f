 Summary 

Taught by Dr. Andy Jones, TCS 191, Writing Across Media, introduces students to experimental approaches to writing for different media and artistic practices, including photography, art installations, radio, film and film criticism, and live staged and multimedia performances. Participants in the class will explore how written texts relate to the images, sounds, and performances in digital and media production. Participants will complete a significant number of inclass and outofclass writing assignments, both individually and as parts of groups. Our common themes, creativity and discovery, will inform all your reading and writing assignments, and prepare you to engage, challenge and impress readers, viewers, and listeners.

In essence, how to write as a creative professional.

No physical book is necessary because Tim Kerbavez PDFed and OCRed the whole thing, available on Smartsite.

 Read “Know It All: Can Wikipedia conquer expertise?” by Stacy Schiff
 This article absolutely does not answer its own title question. Its an especially long article. If you dont like reading, dont take this class. LeTroll
 The author objectively looks at Wikipedias pros and cons. ElFixer
 Wikipedia is the shit. For research paper sources to reading a synopsis of every Pokemon episode that exists. LT
 Thats because Wikipedia is devoted to a higher good. Everyone has everyone elses backs. EF
 Except for trolls, they destroy the integrity and correctness of the info I need at any given moment. LT
 Which brings up the question of why do I need to learn something when Wikipedia has it? EF
 You dont! Wikipedia has made education affordable everywhere. All you need is the interwebs. Case in point: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Laptop_per_Child; One laptop per child LT
  Information ≠ knowledge.  You have to think and learn how to think.  cp
 Does that mean people cant use the tools they are given? Can I not build a bow and arrow out of rocks and sticks to defend myself? LT
 Not only has Wikipedia almost rendered the Britannica Encylopedia useless, its free for everyone and flourishes on donations. EF
 Its a self engaging tool that teaches links after links. LT
 Wikipedia might not be able to make up for a college education, but its getting there. EF
 Wikipedia is useful, but it wont teach you to think critically about what you are reading, especially since Wikipedia strives for NPOV.  Many of the arguments that would help you evaluate a point of view are missing.  Furthermore, the demographic that edits Wikipedia is pretty skewed, e.g., there are far fewer women than men.  So, youre taking in information, but youre not given the tools to evaluate that information, and youre not being taught how to creatively produce new knowledge.  And its passive learning, not active learning.  cp
 Wikipedia is a medium in and of itself. An online database, a community, written by the masses and corrected by the masses. Practically an accident, no one, not even founder, Jimmy Wales, anticipated the project to become the factfinding standard. Accepted by many, rejected by many, Wikipedia continues to cross the boundaries of scholars and knowitalls. DO
