The Wyatt Deck overlooks Lake Spafford and is just across Old Davis Road from the Wyatt Pavilion. It is just east of the T. Elliot Weier Redwood Grove. Most people just pass by on their way from the parking lot by the University Club, but it can be a very nice place to stop and sit for a while. At one point there was an active snack bar here that had been built in 1966.
