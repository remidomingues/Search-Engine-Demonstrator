The address(Wyatt Pavilion,38.538133,121.746731) is located on Old Davis Road across from the Arboretum arboretum.  UC Davis Department of Theatre and Dance often stages performances in Wyatt, which seats 200. The venues small size and wiki:WikiPedia:Elizabethan_theatre Elizabethan style seating create an intimate environment between actors and audience. Nearly opposite from its current incarnation, the Wyatt Pavilion was originally a Stock Judging Pavilion livestock judging arena, erected in 1907, but was relocated and renovated into a theater in 1963. In addition to featuring a thruststageFootnote(The venue has a wiki:WikiPedia:Thrust_Stage Thrust Stage, which means that from the stage, a narrower tongue projects into the audience, so that seating takes the shape of the letter U. Think of a wide models catwalk that allows much more mobility than a simple walkandturn.), the stage itself features two levels that are referred to as the inner below and an inner above. The theatre stage itself accomodates floor traps (trap doors for exits and entrances of actors or set pieces), as is often the case in theatre venues. Backstage features two large set/prop/entrance spaces from behind the theatre cheeksFootnote(Cheeks are the walls on either side of the stage that provide masking, essentially preventing the audience from seeing the backstage area.) and two dressing rooms equipped with bathrooms. Public restrooms are accessible from the outside of the theatre on its southeast face.

Performances at the Wyatt require tickets, which can be purchased ahead of time at the Mondavi Center box office or at the Wyatt door box office beginning one hour prior to showtime.

Users/JudithTruman was the Stage Manager for Shakespeares Much Ado About Nothing in Spring 2000.  Her roomie was costume director and arranged for cast members to wear genuine Mustang football uniforms and BandUh gear.  It was awesome.
