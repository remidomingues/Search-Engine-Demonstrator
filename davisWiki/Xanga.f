Xanga: Worth a page!  Theres a LiveJournal page, and http://www.xanga.com Xanga.com is a very popular alternative. I suppose blogger/blogspot is too, not sure if they have a page.  Actually http://www.orkut.com Orkut too, theres a large UCD community there from where many people first heard of the Daviswiki.

There is nothing more frustrating while waiting in a Computer Labs computer lab line then watching people (specifically those of the female origin {from my observations}) idly check xanga after xanga.
