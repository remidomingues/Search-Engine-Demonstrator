Welcome to the Wiki Howdy, Mr. or Ms. Dong, and Welcome to the Wiki!   You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, so we know who were talking to.  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!

You were wondering why people were questioning your use of an anonymous name, and it is simply because it brings into question your motives and activities.  There are several people who use anonymous names (because they are professors, or because they question the activities of the Police department), but they have established their identity as editors.  Most people use the name they go by (including myself  my wife calls me Wokky).  In addition, you have (so far) only posted negative reviews about one restaurant and engaged in accusations on that same entry.  Its not that youre anonymous, it is that you are anonymous and only being negative.  The two together might make some people wonder if you are a sockpuppet account or otherwise engaging in questionable behavior.   If you told us a bit about yourself, or what you like about Davis, and thus people got to know you, people would be less likely to question your account name.

Honestly, its a bit like somebody you meet in a Cafes local cafe introducing themselves by saying Hi!  Im Mr. Magoo!.  If they then go on to have a normal conversation, then they are generally seen as sane.  Somebody introducing themselves as Mr. Magoo and then ranting about how the person sitting next to them is actually a spy working for the owners of the cafe... well, thats a bit of a warning sign that something just aint right.  If you want to go by the name Mr. Magoo or Mark Twain or Xiao Ding Dong, thats fine, but as of right now (probably unintentionally) youre coming off like a crazy eyed person sitting in the corner.  Most people here are pretty open and friendly; we are (or were) your neighbors, the people you see walking around downtown, and the wiki community is pretty much like the Davis community itself  you can introduce yourself and chat with people.  Some people might use pseudonyms when striking up conversations with people at Chipotle, but most dont.  When its an obvious fake name, it just looks a little odd, and some people will understandably take what the person is saying with a grain of salt.

Im only explaining because you asked.  Regardless of what you choose to call yourself or have others call you (hey, look at my nickname), youre more than welcome here, and wed like to get to know you.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
