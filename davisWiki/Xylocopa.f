Xylocopa
psychedelic world music band based in Davis, formed by Patrick Foley, Tobit Maytal, Dave Dauphine and Colin Foley in 2010 or 2011. We play original songs, covers and jams, and have performed at small venues (such as the Village Homes Craft Fair, ArtAbout, parties etc.). The core band varies from month to month, but many musicians have associated with this band and now are like spirits in the wind ... or maybe they just have lives. Xylocopa is a greek word meaning woodcutter, and it is the name of the large genus of tropical Carpenter bees, 3 species of which have outposts in California. Xylocopa varipuncta is the largest bee in our area, the females shiny and black, the males furry, golden with green eyes. They dig holes in the redwood arbor under Xylocopa Studios.
