YME changed its name in May 2008 to Breast Cancer Network of Strength® to better reflect our mission. While we’ve changed our name, our mission remains the same – to ensure that no one faces breast cancer alone.

The cornerstone of this organization has been and continues to be peer support. In order to strengthen the identity of our core services, we introduced YourShoes™ 24/7 Breast Cancer Support Center. YourShoes services include our 24/7 hotline with realtime interpretation in more than 150 languages, peer support via our Web site, and support groups led by trained facilitators. All YourShoes services are conducted by breast cancer survivors. The words of one of our callers nicely sums ups the value of peer support: Even though my family is a wonderful support system, I needed someone who had been in my shoes.
