Y2k Hair and Nails is a Beauty Salons and Barber Shops hair and nail salon run by a professional licensed nail technician and hair stylist.  There are two locations for Y2k Hair and Nails; one is located in Oakshade Town Center and the other is downtown near the Amtrak station. The business card says that they are open on Sunday, but according to the lady that works at the downtown location, they are closed on Sunday. The Oakshade location is open on Sundays.

Y2K Hair and Nails is fairly new, so it is clean, and professional. They are stocked with numerous nail polish shades by O.P.I.

Gift certificates are available.

20070501 13:03:11 nbsp The downtown location is much smaller than the other one only the vibe is much more friendly and accomidating.  The ladies were really sweet and I had a nice relaxing afternoon. Users/HeatherParker

20070508 04:22:26 nbsp The ladies that work here are very gentle. But the lady that did my nails did not do that great of a job with my fiberglass set. I had to go home and file them down some more, even after i repeatedly asked her to make them more narrow to fit my finger. After about three days the fake nail starting peeling up. Oh, they also have higher prices now than what was posted on the brochure/this page. Overall y2k nails has a very relaxing and friendly environment but definitely not the best place to get your nails done. They also charged my friend a $1 fee for using her atm/credit card. Users/AmyYang

20070525 14:06:05 nbsp avoid this place at all costs! Its a rip off and the owners wife who operates the Oakshade location is definitly not customer service oriented. I was unhappy with the quality of manicure I received and she yelled at me that I was a racist trying to take adavantage of a minority business owner. If the Owner was at the store i might go there again because he called me at my home to apologize for his wifes behavior... Users/MyaBrn

20070624 22:44:22 nbsp I went to the Cowell location and I had a young man give me a pedicure. He was friendly but seemed a bit messy, dropping the nailpolish into the foot spa thingy and cussing randomly. My pedi was very well done though. The rest of the ladies dont ever seem to smile but my friends got manicures there and they did well.  Users/FeliciaTing

20070724 12:12:27 nbsp Robbie does an awsome job! He has been doing hair in Davis for 20 years. He has a long standing reputation for being the best at what he does! He cuts, colors and styles most of the Woodstocks crew.  Users/Hen

20070821 10:31:52 nbsp Ah! I walked into Y2K hair and nails and went straight up to Dawn.  I dyed my beautiful blond locks black. It wasn’t even a pretty black. It was like green black and I had a date in 5 hours! Not only did she fix my hair to a light brown color that day, she scheduled appointments to get my hair lighter and blonder.  Since then, we have experiments, but the way she treats my hair, it is as good as new, hardly any damage and still incredibly healthy.  I don’t know of any other hair stylist that could not only fix gross green black hair, but become a friend and a confidant! Users/Alysa

20070918 11:49:44 nbsp They actually have a hair salon as well!  Robbie from the Hair Factory is in the same location! Go see him. I have been in the area for over 5 yrs. and he has always been my hairdresser! He is always willing to listen and give his clients the best hair cut that he can.  His talants are great! Do yourself a favor and have Robbie give you a great new look! Users/JulieDow

20071210 12:16:41 nbsp I have been looking for a good hair stylist for over a year with reasonable prices and finally I found Robbie. Robbie does exactly what you want and is super nice to boot. I know three people who go to him and they are all very happy with his work. Users/steph

20080115 22:50:21 nbsp Dawn did a great job of cutting and coloring my hair!  She really worked with me to help select a hair color (I have black hair and wanted it lighter, but hate the damage that results from bleaching).  She won’t do something that will damage your hair, and my hair felt stronger and healthier after I left the salon.  I really appreciated her advice and input.  She’s also extremely sweet and funny, so I had a great time )  I recommend Dawn, especially if you want someone that’s honest and cares about the health of your hair.   Users/sandrahnesna

20080612 18:59:11 nbsp Sharon was great! She gave me a great cut & color. A very sweet person. I will definately be back to see her. Users/celina

20080613 17:17:22 nbsp Robbie is amazing! I usually have an overall idea of how I want my hair to look, but he makes is fabulous with all the detail, the right coloring and highlights to match. Robbie is fun, super nice and talented.Brenda Users/MovieFan07

20080621 18:50:51 nbsp I just got my hair cut with Dawn who is absolutely wonderful!  I love how she asked me exactly what I wanted and did exactly that.  I like how she shared her expert knowledge with me.  I love my hair!  :) Users/SRAJ

20080703 19:11:06 nbsp the oakshade place sucks they talk all chinease about you and the nails crack the next day dont ever go there or u will be riped off  Users/pebble

20080713 12:21:03 nbsp I love the downtown location!  i had a brazilian waxing done a couple of days ago for the first time and the lady that did it was amazing.  she was very gentle and was patient with me considering how nervous i was.  her name is YoungSook and i wouldnt go to anyone else.  she was very thorough and i would definately recommend her to everyone!   Users/enchantedforest

20080716 15:21:20 nbsp this place does not accept credit btw. they just have an atm machine so bring your checkbook. it was my first time with dawn and she seriously talks you through everything shes doing and everything shes going to do to your hair. she cuts a lot slower than the stylists ive been to in san jose. she really does take care of every single strand of your head but if youre going for a more generic look, $35 might be a lil too much for it here. next time, im coming back and going for a much fun look to get my moneys worth.  Users/julpham

20080721 18:54:17 nbsp Young Sook is super super good! She is kind, patient, and thorough. I went in for a eyebrow and chin/lip wax, She spent alot of time on me, which was a good thing. Afterwards, she applied some kind of lotion and some mineral powder to hide the redness. It was great! I will go back.  Users/llee10789

20090123 09:10:02 nbsp Ive had bikini waxing from Young Sook and a hair cut from Dawn. Young Sook is wonderful  very professional, clean, gentle, and thorough. Ive been recommending her to my friends. The haircut from Dawn was okay. She is very sweet, but didnt really do what I asked and cut much more drastic layers than I indicated I wanted. So, I think she listens, but just be clear about what, specifically, you want!! Users/Ratatat

20090127 10:17:03 nbsp After losing Robbie, I finally found him again at this salon and will be going back.  Hes worth every penny. Users/BevSykes

20090306 16:40:54 nbsp Let me begin by saying how awesome my hair is now that I have found DAWN. Never before have I ever felt like a stylist has understood me so well. DAWN really took her time in helping me refine my idea of what I wanted my hair to be. She is reasonably priced and IMO the best one there. She is the sweetest lady and a phenomenal stylish! I recommend her to anyone that is looking for a great cut & color. DAWN ROCKS!!!
♥ Users/ginny

20090306 16:46:49 nbsp Oh! I forgot to mention, that the best way to make sure you get DAWN (and not someone else) is to call her cell directly. 1(916)3088588. Users/ginny

20090421 11:13:55 nbsp FOR ALL THE YOUNG SOOK LOVERS!
She has opened up her own salon in downtown Davis.  It is located at 636 4th Street.
ARA SPA!  It is a brand new spa.  Anna and Vince from Y2K are doing the nail services and Young is the esthetician.
She is immaculate, amazing and really affordable.  I refuse to go anywhere else for waxing.   Users/MeganMills

20090914 13:23:10 nbsp If you want an amazing and stylish haircut for a very reasonable price, then go to Robbie. All of my girlfriends (who are much more fashion savvy than I) have been going to Robbie for years, and after repeated hair envy moments with each of their subsequent haircuts outdoing the last, I finally started going to him. Ive seen him do every type of hair well  mine is super long and he managed to make it dramatic while keeping the length; most of my friends have short to medium length hair.  If you have always wanted to do something new or edgy but are afraid to go there, hes the right person to get you to do it (point in case, I have bangs for the first time since childhood...and I actually love them.

The key is that he is both skilled and hes always doing his research.  Hes up to date about styles and is ready to bring ideas to the table, and then executes it fantastically.  Plus, hes about the most enjoyable person to talk to while getting your hair done.   Users/HillaryThomas

20090921 09:57:38 nbsp I went here for a pedicure for the first time and it was just ok, I usually like to talk to the ladys ,but the one lady I got was really mean and rude and was constantly speaking Japanese to her co workers which made me feel uncomfortable. She also did not seem to take her time and listen to me. She had drained the water before I could even ask for a Deluxe pedicure. The place was clean though and the service was good. I accidentally smeared the polish while drying and the lady fixed it. Overall, a better good value for a pedicure. The pedicure starts out with trimming and filing the nails, soaking in the tub, cuticle cream and moisturizer, rubbing the feet and legs, the best part is the hot stones(feels so good), then finishing off with a polish. Good place, bad customer communication and courtesy.  Users/ElizabethBarthel

20090926 17:33:11 nbsp I just walkedin and was so lucky that Dawn was able to take me today! I brought in a picture and she cut it exactly like it! She is so nice and helpful...I will definitely be reccomending Dawn to anyone that is looking for a haircut! DAWN IS AWESOME! Users/EmilyRichards

20091006 21:17:24 nbsp Hey, its Robbie!  Contrary to what you may believe, Im still here in town!  Give me a call on my cell: 5303047750, and well set up an appointment! Sorry for the confusion!

Thanks,
Robbie  Users/HairByRobbie

20091104 12:31:20 nbsp Robbies the best:  great with hair, and a great guy to know as well.  Utterly unfazed by cranky, disobedient, he sends me away every four weeks feeling good about myself and the world in general.  Theres no better recommendation in my book. Users/JCooper

20091119 08:34:26 nbsp I went in yesterday (Nov 18, 2009) and Dawn and Robbies stations were cleaned out  theyre GONE!! This is a disaster! Does anyone know where they went???  Trina Filan Users/Filan

20091119 16:43:59 nbsp DAWN my favorite hairstylist has moved!! As of only 11162009. She is only a quick couple of blocks away at Lasting Impressions on 632 4th street(4th and Fst) If you want to make an appointment call her directly at 9163088588 or come on in and visit her. She does the best hair at reasonable prices..Go visit her!!! Users/ginny

20091203 15:26:00 nbsp If you want a great cut, you MUST call Robbie.  His number is (530) 3047750.  Whenever you see anyone with cute hair in Davis, chances are Robbie did it.  Ive had long hair, short hair, bangs, color, everything and Robbie can do it all!  I receive compliments constantly and always, always recommend Robbie.  You cant find better!  As a plus, hes a great man and fun to be around.  No boring hair appointments here!  Call Robbie.  You wont regret it. Users/AshleyHorton

20091206 19:53:50 nbsp Thank GOODNESS!!!! Found Dawn. Hair is back to NICE. Fantastic  what would we do without her? Users/Filan

20100209 16:48:14 nbsp Hands down the best hair stylist in Davis is ROBBIE! He lives up to all of his great reviews for sure. I had been seeing my local Southern Oregon stylist ever since I was 14 (Im 19 now) and she has never ever been able to do my hair as well as Robbie did today! I just moved to Davis and was looking for someone to give me a haircut and touch up my roots before an interview today, I called Robbie yesterday and even though he was super busy he managed to make time for me and my hair! He has the most reasonable pricing as well. After my appointment I was blown away. My color has never looked this good and he made my hair feel soft and light with the greatest layers. On top of that, he has the best personality, and made me laugh really really hard! My boyfriend came with me to my appointment and we had the greatest time socializing with him about everything, there was never a dull moment. I felt as I knew him forever even though wed just met! I literally could not stop looking at my hair in the mirror when he was done.  Anyone in Davis who wants a flawless professional quality haircut from someone who has been in the business for years, you MUST MUST MUST call Robbie at the number he has listed here. GREAT EXPERIENCE!

BUT BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE ABOUT Y2K NAILS! I went in for a haircut the other day and the quality of stylists has absolutely diminished! They have no idea how to do hair or nails! They are VERY VERY RUDE, can barely understand English, can barely speak English and overall provide an extremely uncomfortable environment for customers. Their nails only last about 3 days until they start chipping and lifting, and they are very crude and not careful with their tools at all. On top of that all of their stations are FILTHY, they dont seem to clean very well. DO NOT GET YOUR NAILS OR HAIR DONE HERE as I can promise you that youll be disappointed.

All in all, Y2K is a TERRIBLE TERRIBLE business and really should be AVOIDED AT ALL COSTS!!! However, Robbie actually cares about his clients, is not money hungry, and by far has amazing hair talents that cant be topped by any Davis salon. Users/cutechristine

20100221 17:46:17 nbsp HAVE NO FEAR!!! ROBBIE IS ALIVE AND IN DAVIS, WILLING TO STYLE YOUR HAIR!!!
in the past year, robbie has been seemingly MIA. i called y2k looking for him time and time again, and they offered no help or suggestions. i thought he just vanished from the face of the earth. i finally came to this page and saw robbies cell phone number and gave it a try, and bingo, robbie picked up after 2 rings.
this man knows how to cut hair. he cut my hair just this morning and i feel 100x better about myself than i did yesterday. i have been going to all kinds of places in davis, trying to get a decent haircut with miserable results.
he is so laid back, so friendly, so flexible, he is so straight forward and one on one, he will give your hair the time and attention it deserves basically what a hair stylist SHOULD be. seriously, dont waste your time or money anywhere else. this guy rules.(530) 3047750 thats his cell phone number where i was able to reach him at. Users/roseanneflowers

20100222 01:17:01 nbsp How much does this incredible Robbie charge for a cut? Does he have his own salon? Im ready to have one decent haircut for the first time in my life.  Users/ArianeMetz

20100429 15:31:15 nbsp I have only been to the downtown location and I always have a relaxing time. The guy has always done my nails and he does a very good job. Its a little expensive 35 for a fill with clear and glitter for the tips. I would definitely recommend this place Users/Ldish949

20100515 22:43:53 nbsp Ariane, this is a little late, but Robbie charged me $25 for my haircut and I had long, long, LONG hair. Down past my lower back easily. He cut off maybe a foot?

Anyway, I called Robbie up because I have been going to him for years since I was 13...first real haircut. Im almost 20 now, and he did an amazing job as always! Both of my brothers, my good friend, my mom, and I have all seen Robbie at some point or another. This last time I went with my boyfriend, both of us wanting something new. Wed had long hair for much too long. He did the bf first and Im STILL in love with his new hair, weeks later. He looks amazing. When it was my turn, I showed him what I wanted, and hes not only amazingly helpful, hes funny and the best conversationalist. Ive gone to other hair stylists and we literally have nothing to talk about. Ive been trying to get my hair cut a certain way for years and could never find it, and Robbie saw my picture and told me its called a shag haircut. He did an awesome job on my hair and its so much lighter and I adore all the layers. )

I always regret visiting other hair stylists because they usually end up butchering my hair Angies salon...been to 3 of the 4 ladies and they never do a good job, and it always ends in me going to Robbie to fix it. I only go to him now because he never fails to do a wonderful job on my hair. I highly recommend him. Call him up at his cell listed above and give him a chance. Hes easiest to reach that way. ) Users/HannahFolkes

20101119 16:40:22 nbsp Ive been to the downtown location several times for a deluxe pedicure by Lilly or Anna. They both do a great job and are very friendly.
 Users/nowhereman

20110320 10:48:30 nbsp I went to the Y2K Oakshade Town Center location and asked for a full set, had to get fiberglass because the acrylic this nail tech had was pink and I didnt want pink nails.  Despite multiple listings for $25 fiberglass full set, I was charged $35.  I do not know why, but it is cause for enough concern that I may never return with business to Y2K.  My nail tech was T. T. Nguyen, her station is the one against the front windows and farthest from the door. Users/redbike

20110331 13:33:03 nbsp Hey, did you know that Robbie is still in town and if you go to the shop they will tell you they do not know where he is at,from personal experience! You can get a hold of him on his cellphone at 5303047750, I just got my hair cut from him and he is awesome as usual. He just got back into town after being gone for a few months on personal business.





 Users/Earnie

20110430 11:12:33 nbsp Ive been to the downtown location. I go to get my eyebrows waxed and they do a great job. Not thin and unnatural looking, they just clean it up. Minimal pain and redness, they know what theyre doing. The prices for waxing are great and the women are friendly.  Users/AbigaleMoody

20120112 13:15:27 nbsp The owner of Y2K Nails, T T Nguyen has no regard for long time clients.  I made an honest mistake (first and only time in MY LIFE) and closed my bank account before she cashed my check.  Totally my fault and I have no problem paying the fees.  However, she did not attempt to call me or send me a post card asking me to come in and pay.  In fact, I had no idea it didnt go through until I got a DEMAND letter from the District Attorney of Yolo County, Check Prosecution Unit stating that she had filed criminal charges against me! (A customer of over 4+ years!!)  Wow.  A $25 check and her $12 returned check fee turned into $287 bill due to Yolo County.  I paid it obviously it was my fault.  I went into the salon and asked her why she didnt call or anything and if there was anything she could do to help me.  She BARELY looked at me the whole time and kept saying it wasnt her problem.  I had to BEG her for a complimentary pedicure and she barely obliged to that.  I gave her the gift cert back and told her if she wasnt inclined to meet me a little more half way, I wasnt interested in being a continuing client.  So unfortunate.  Watch out for her.  She doesnt care about her customers, or apparently her technicians since theyre the ones losing out. Users/MD324

20120612 17:33:24 nbsp I dont mean to be sexist, but I will never again go to get my pedicures here because I was serviced by the male nail technician who was waaaaaaay too rough. I was wincing and retracting my feet several times throughout the appointment and even told him verbally, ow! too hard!. I dont need my skin scrubbed off and my nails trimmed to the bone and to be handled like meat in the poultry aisle of the grocery store. No thanks. I wanted to get out of there so bad, and felt like a hostage when I was supposed to feel relaxed. ugh!  Users/Arcamedes123

20121023 19:44:54 nbsp STEER CLEAR!! I went to the Oakshade salon for a mani/pedi 30 dollar special. I had an event less than twentyfour hours later (reason for visit), and only 7 hours later my fingernails were already chipped, and by the event, embarrassingly so! She put on 2 layers of polish and a clear coat, so how this could be I did not understand. When I do my nails myself, with only one layer even, they are not chipped so soon.  I went back in assuming they would be apologetic and repaint my nails without hesitation, BUT NO! It was my fault, I did not buy the fifteen dollar extra to get the mani that would last, and my nails must be oily, or I was very rough on them!  How could my nails be oily when they clean them?!! I was not rough on my hands!  I did not buy the expensive extra treatment because I thought it would be very safe to assume that my nails would not be badly chipped less than twenty four hours later!  My pedicure was poor in that she did not put any effort into exfoliating the skin. My heels did not look any better than if I had gone over them quickly with a pumice in the shower, which is to say that she went over them quickly. The leg massage consisted of her massaging my shins with the rocks! Note to spa: shin massages do not feel good what is the point?!  I wish there was something I could do to get my money back, or at least my tip. Can a person ask for a tip back? I would not have made this complaint had the establishment either: 1. Given me a manicure that lasted for at least twentyfour hours, or 2. Offered to repaint my nails or remove the color at the very least.  Oh, and the person who did my mani talked on the phone for 5 minutes in the process!  The technician who did my nails has the pedi station furthest from the front door (by the wall) and the mani station that is perpendicular to the window stations. I will stick to Ara Spa in the future! Users/SDAK

20130206 18:29:12 nbsp I go here on a regular basis for the deluxe spa pedicure and always ask for Heidi. She does a great job and is very friendly and willing to chat. Ive tried a couple of other nail salons but havent found anyone as good as Heidi.  Users/nowhereman

20130922 11:59:01 nbsp Oakshade Center: HORRIBLE. HORRIBLE. HORRIBLE. I will never step foot in this place again and I hate myself for as long as I was their customer. I have been putting up with the overall service just because its close to where I leave & because they sometimes have offers. But they are continuously rude, never welcoming, you feel like they do you a favor by letting you in their store with YOUR money, you know they talk behind your back about you or whatever & giggle to each other and you just stay there not understanding their language. As if all this was not enough, last time they DESTROYED my big toe nail... trying to do everything fast (and make more money per hour of course), one of them butchered the skin around my toe and as a result I literally could not step my foot on the floor for 4 days. Unacceptable. Furthermore I have seen them many many times putting acetone in the nail polish so that it is more fluid and workable after staying on the shelves forever. No wonder their manis/pedis dont last for long. Users/RobinFoul
