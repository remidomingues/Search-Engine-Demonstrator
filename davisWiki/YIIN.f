The Yolo Interfaith Immigration Network is a group of people serving and advocating for immigrants in Yolo County.  They believe that by working together, we can make our community a better place for all of us to live and thrive.  Any member of the Yolo County Community is welcome to attend a meeting and raise any item or issue pertinent to immigration or immigrants in Yolo County.  For more information, contact the YIIN president, Alison Pease, at Mailto(alisonmp@gmail.com).

 Upcoming Event 

Please mark your calendar for YIINs annual fundraising dinner and silent auction, which will be on the evening of Saturday April 5 at the Davis Community Church.  Proceeds will support (1) YIINs programs and (2) undocumented college students in Yolo County.  Tickets, which will be $30 each, will be available in midFebruary, but I wanted you to know the date so you can plan to attend and show your continued support for YIIN, its projects, and the local immigrant community.

Mariachi Puente will provide entertainment, the Indian banquet will be cooked by Master Chef Mary Philip, and the evening promises to be a lot of fun.
