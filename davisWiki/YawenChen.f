Hey there. Im a 2007 graduate of UC Davis, with a degree in Psychology, and Human Development. Informal minors in Women and Gender Studies and Technocultural Studies. Im proud to belong to the early testing stages of this wiki project. Thanks Users/PhilipNeustrom for inviting me!

Currently, I live in Brooklyn, New York, working in the nerdy internet division of Scholastic books company at Scholastic Headquarters in SoHo, New York City. Quite a ways from my publishing experience at our small town college paper, The California Aggie. Any other Davis in New York people here?

I love food, photography, technology, bicycling, and a lot of other cool things I cant remember.
