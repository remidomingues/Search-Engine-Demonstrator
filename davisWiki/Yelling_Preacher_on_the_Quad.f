He has a beard and wears all denim. He stands on the grass near of the center walkway and scream screams about Jesus until his voice is hoarse. And after his voice is hoarse he screams for another hour. Sometimes people bring chairs out to listen to him rant.

And then he disappears for months, only to return again to do the same thing. No one has ever seen him convert anyone. But he certainly is one of the more elusive of the Town Characters.

He should not be confused with a small group of characters from Nevada who come about once a year with Preachers with Signs  large signs to preach.

Im not sure but this may be a reference to Brother Jed Smock Brother Jed a rather portly gentleman who wears suspenders and rants about the sin of premarital kissing, shouts trollop! at passing sorority girls, and makes frequent references to his virgin daughter.  Sometimes she accompanies him and wily young men plot to seduce her, or at least find out if shes really as good as her father thinks.  When hes not here hes at other universities, I believe he spends all his time going from university to university doing this.  He has a http://www.brojed.org/ webpage and is brojed on AIM actually.  Ive had him on my list for at least a year now actually but never felt saucy enough to start a conversation with him, or even IM him. Users/KrisFricke

Definitely a great event, Ive seen him a few nights in the spring  Users/RohiniJasavala

Ive seen brother Jed on campus before, but theres also this really skinny guy who will start yelling and preaching.  Hes always dressed in somewhat shabby clothes, but he always wears a tie.  He has a slight mustache, and is good at quoting the bible.  Not really good about processing the information, but hey, hes good at yelling too.  Id like to see shabby skinny mustache and tie guy square off against the heftier Brother Jed.  Could this guy Im describing be Joe Sherman Joe Sherman? Users/JaimeRaba jr

  Oh yeah, that is certainly Joe Sherman Crazy Joe.  Users/RobRoy

Ive created a page for Brother Jed, since he appeared on the quad today and deserves our recognition. Brother Jed Smock


20041226 18:50:31 nbsp He has his right to be there. But please dont confuse him with my Alpha Gamma Omega AGO brothers (the Christian Fraternity that prays near the flagpole at 12 PM every school day) Users/GeorgejAndrews

20041226 23:52:00 nbsp Off topic, but isnt it contrary to Matthew 6:6 to pray at the flagpole at 12 pm every school day? Users/KenjiYamada

20041228 00:38:02 nbsp i m really glad you brought up that point. At first 4 years ago, i was confused by the 12 PM prayer also because it seemed like the excact actions of the Pharisees in the bible. But the flagpole location is used out of convenience. Most of the AGO guys pray there because most of us are around the flagpole area at noon. But i totally understand how it could be misinterpreted that way. In Matthew 6, Jesus was making a jab at the boastful Pharisee who had a holier then you attitude. AGO does not pray with a holier attitude. In fact, all are welcome into the prayer circle. Come join us :) Users/GeorgejAndrews

20041228 07:56:18 nbsp Im not religious but thanks for the invitation.  Maybe the criticism could be avoided by meeting at the flagpole and then going somewhere private to pray?  Users/KenjiYamada

20050405 16:28:40 nbsp OK so today there was a man out on the Quad yelling and preaching from like 1 pm to 2 or thereabouts...he doesnt seem to fit any of these descriptions though so Im not sure who he was.  He was middleaged, with gray hair, wore sunglasses, and dressed fairly casually (blue collared shirt and jeans).  He had another man with him who was dressed in similar clothing and who didnt yell anything but occasionally encouraged the guy who was yelling.  For awhile nobody noticed and then people started walking by and stopping to listen...one dude was hella mocking him, another girl got up in his face when he said she was sinning and all that jazz.  Anyway it was kinda funny and random.  So who is this third dude, and did anyone else witness this?  Users/KalenRidenour

20050405 17:43:30 nbsp I might have been the guy that was hella mocking him although I tried to be pretty respectful.I wasnt the guy that rode by him on a bike and pretended to jerk off. HAHAHAA!! Users/PeteHernandez got a picture of him and his name. Users/JackHaskel

20050421 13:50:52 nbsp Ah yes, the bike masturbator  my roommate, Damian Fernandez. Can we post the picture somewhere? He was so proud... Users/DanielMedinaCleghorn

20050429 00:57:51 nbsp Maybe this page should be renamed to Yelling PreacherS on the quad since there seems to be a few... what do you guys think? Users/AbbyLawson

20100528 15:59:09 nbsp hes been yelling opposite Chipotle these days, slim dude .. not portly. Users/hiraalikhan

20110227 15:28:07 nbsp Is brother Jed the same guy that yells opposite Chipotle?  There was someone there today spouting nonsense but he didnt have a beard.

I was amused when a homeless man started to heckle him. Users/OliviaY
  No, that is Joe Sherman Joe
