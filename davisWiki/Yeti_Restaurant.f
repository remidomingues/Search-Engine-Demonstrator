20120519 09:41:55 nbsp Ive been pleasantly surprised by this place. By far the best Chicken Tikka Misala Ive had in Davis. Ive tried Namaste Napals and Rajas but they dont quite compare. Their samosas were also very good. I will be returning.  Users/OliviaGlass

20120519 14:42:51 nbsp I was disappointed by how few vegetarian options they offer. Only three entreessaag paneer, navratan korma and aloo gobiwhich is kind of shocking for an Indian place. On the other hand, my dining companion was really pleased with his tandoori chicken, so maybe meateaters should give this a shot. Users/Psittacosaurus

20120528 22:37:40 nbsp they have really good food than other restaurant in davis. they  have diffrent taste. i think everything is fine.   Users/ronaldjackson

20120530 17:53:38 nbsp Went here for dinner a few nights ago. Service was pretty slow but I guess thats too be expected since theyre just starting out. We ordered the veggie combo appetizer platter which was very delicious, but a little too greasy. Their naan is pretty tasty also. For entrees we got the matter paneer and chicken tikka masala. Both were very delicious. Each of us also ordered Mango lassis which were huge and pretty tasty. A warning for those of you who cant handle spicy, I generally like my food pretty spicy and we usually order our Indian food medium spicy, as we did here. Here though medium was way spicy was way too much. Next time Id definitely order mild.  Users/ShankarSankaran

20120606 15:36:20 nbsp The food is great.  The service, unfortunately, is not.  Users/ellenjoyce

20120609 20:41:13 nbsp I went to this restaurant tonight. I have to say I was pretty disappointed. The food was ok, not that great. The service wasnt bad despite what the last few commenters mentioned. They didnt have soda so I got a Mango Lassi, it was ok, but again not great. We ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Rhango Josh. Though the menu doesnt say so the waiter told us that you get rice or naan with each dish. It was $11.99 for the chicken tikka and $12.99, since the menu isnt online yet I thought that might help people out. The portions were small though, neither me nor my dining companion were full and they were not spectacularly good either. We both agreed that on a scale of 110 it was a solid 5.  Users/hbtisell

20120618 09:21:38 nbsp Went there for lunch with a work colleague. We did have good service (although we had to ask for the check after a long wait) and the chef/owner did come out and ask us how the meal was, which was nice.  The flavors were bright and interesting, however the lamb was so overcooked and chewy.  I will give it another try as I like sitting on the patio. Users/LokiAbbi

20120625 22:50:29 nbsp I came here tonight with my husband. We were going to Kathmandu cause we have a coupon but this place was 20% off orders of $20 or more so we tried it. It was great! We had the meat combo platter (9.95?) and the navratan korma (8.95?). We also got an extra side of garlic cilantro naan (2.25) even though the meat platter came with plain naan. The service was good! Although, we were the only ones in there to start... :) All the items on the meat platter were great. The sauces were great. They were the typical tamarind, mint chutney, and spivy curry sauces that you find in other restaurants but with a different balance of seasonings. Very nice. The vegetable curry we had was really great! It look small in that little dish it comes in, but really, over rice or naan, its quite a bit. I was telling my husband that kathmandu used to be my favorite but I feel a few months ago they changed their style to become a bit more mainstream or commercial. Yeti has a bit of the rustic authentic feel to it (coming from someone who has never been to India or Nepal) that I used to like about Kathmandu. Im glad its here and I want it here for good!!!! I would give it a 4.5 of 5. (My favorite Indian restaurant is in Kawasaki Japan and that one is a 5).   Users/hitobito

20120702 06:22:36 nbsp We went last night. Basically a decent place. Pros: outside patio, friendly staff, free pakoras  because of long wait, there were in fact at least 10 vegetarian entrees, good food flavors, big mango lassis. Cons: wow its slow! There are some English barriers so you dont have a lot of confidence that the order is right. Wine is a bit pricey considering rest of menu. And come on about rice, chutney etc. Would it be so hard to serve rice with every meal instead of requiring it as a side dish and then giving small portions? And I have to disagree with spicy comment below I ordered spicy and it was what I would call medium. Tandoori dishes looked beautiful but my husband said it was basically just shrimp and lettuce.

20120712 14:02:09 nbsp I just had the lunch buffet yesterday. Hands down the best tasting Indian food I have had in Davis and the staff were pleasant and helpful.
I was surprised how few people were there. Do yourself a favor and try it. Users/AlanAldrich

20120721 20:58:46 nbsp My wife and I hit up the lunch buffet today.  We were toward the end of the lunch time, a few minutes after 2pm, so some of the dishes were running a little low.  Overall, though, the food was pretty good.  Not amazing, but pretty good.  The naan was quite light and fluffy, although maybe a touch too salty (and I like salty naan!)  Service was good, and they kept my water filledwhich was awfully nice on a hot day like today.

All in all, its good, but IMO not the best Indian in town.  Id want to try ordering it for dinner, rather than relying on a lunch buffet, before making a final judgment, though. Users/TomGarberson

20120723 12:31:42 nbsp The vegetable momos were superb the other night when we went for dinner. Also I enjoyed the spiciness of the chutneys that accompanied them. It looks like their buffet is vegfriendly, too (which isnt surprising, just notable).  Users/ChrisV

20120729 21:33:52 nbsp Ate here tonight. Food was good! I had the Rogan Josh, which was good, but unfortunately I have had better. Boyfriend had the Chicken Tikki Marsala, which I daresay may have been better than Kathmandus. Service was prompt and polite. Also had the Mango Lassi  they give you a huge glass full. Delicious! Entrees come with your choice of rice or naan, but you can order extra on the side.  Users/Adalwolf

20121001 15:11:18 nbsp We ate here this weekend, wonderful! My husband is vegan and they were so accommodating. Service & food were fantastic! Great prices too, give them a try. Users/jwendt

20121118 08:29:46 nbsp ate there last night and it was GREAT! We came in and apologized that we had to get a quick bite and what would be best to order. They have a quick foods part on the menu but he told us that he could get anything out quickly. He did and it was excellent. Chicken Saag, and an eggplant dish. Ill be going back. It was really good! Users/Lasan

20130408 17:34:59 nbsp 1st time. I had lunch today. I think it is possibly the best Indian restaurant in town. My experience however was not good because of the portion size. After reading the reviews here I wanted my 1st time to be the buffet. Just so I could try different ways they prepare their different dishes. They no longer have the lunch buffet. So, I ordered from the dinner menu, a combo Tikki Marsala dish. (They do however have a lunch special). What I had was a very small bowl with 4 or 5 pieces of meat. The few pieces were amazing! Just saying The $17.00 order which I am happy to pay with a reasonable portion, was absurd! Users/ashleyinthemist

20130516 12:01:15 nbsp I tried Yeti Restaurant a few weeks back for lunch and the only things I could say about the place is OM NOM NOM!  I had the Chicken Tikka Misala and it is by far the best Ive had around.  The service was very good and the gentleman helping us was very polite.  The only downfall was it took a bit of time to get the bill, but I have nothing negative to say about this place and I would recommend everyone to try it atleast once. Users/BrianIgarashi

20130816 11:38:46 nbsp Food very good!  Atmosphere...not so exciting.  On my last visit, they accidently served me someone elses food.  Before they told me it was mistakenly delivered, I picked up the bread and set it to the side.  They then apologized for delivering it to the wrong table, took it back to the kitchen (including the bread I had moved), rearranged, then took it to the right table.  I witnessed all of this from my table next to the kitchen.  I understand there are mistakes and there was absolutely no complaint for the wrong delivery, I was just disappointed to see it rearranged and delivered to the right table.  I spoke with the wait staff regarding this and no one understood.       Users/CameronMunnally

20130823 16:41:28 nbsp Have been to Yetis twice since it opened. Both times, the food has been delicious.  The people were very nice, and the owner was very attentive to make sure things were to our liking.  Among the dishes we have tried are the muttar paneer, lamb vindaloo, and a chefs special curry. All of them were delicious.  They also had samosas with both the cilantro and tamarind chutney, which were very good.  The cucumber salad with a sweet and sour sauce was ok (I would prefer it a bit more spicy, but some others might like it as is, with a slightly sweeter sauce).  Will definitely return. Users/ManuelCalderonDeLaBarca

20140310 09:35:16 nbsp I went about a month ago with a friend, and the food was delicious. Had the pepper pot soup and a lunch special that I dont see on the menu provided, and both were fantastic. I will definitely be back.  Users/acparsons

20140711 20:55:36 nbsp I normally dont leave a lot of online reviews but this one deserves it. Great place! Most importantly, the food was very good and tasty, best Indian/Nepalese food Ive had in Davis. The outdoor tables were very nice and gave a nice view of central Davis in the evening. The staff was very nice and friendly, we were waited on by maybe 4 different people and all were great. Food was a very good value, we got two entrees, a mango lassi (only $1.50), and an appetizertotal cost w/tax was about $30. Not bad for dinner for two in Davis. Give it a try! Users/EricJensen

20140713 20:06:46 nbsp I have had a few meals here that were really good, so I decided to have them cater a recent party of mine.  Everything was delicious, and I was really happy with the experience overall.  Praj was very helpful and easy to work with.  The veggie momos and the samosas in particular were a big hit, but I liked everything we ordered: chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken, saag paneer, navratan korma, aloo gobi, and, of course, naan.  (Actually, I didnt even order my favorite dish, which is the began bharta, because not everyone loves eggplant the way I do).  I look forward to future meals and caterings with them. Users/RobertaMIllstein

20140714 13:57:31 nbsp This is the best indian food in town, it took me a while to try this place but it is quite awesome. Users/DagonJones
