I highly recommend the Hatha Kundalini Flow yoga at the EC with Annie Laurie!  Alina Dini AD

And I highly recommend the Vinyasa Flow class taught by Users/KaliSlusser Kali Slusser at Barefoot Yoga Studio Users/JanelleAlvstadMattson Janelle

Bikram Yoga is wonderful  the new studio on L Street (Bikram Yoga Davis) in Davis is run by a wonderful woman named Erin who is the perfect person to introduce you to this hot yoga, if youve never been.  Great facility, brilliant workout, accessible for every level.   Users/ElHarvey EH

I think the Bo Tree is a wonderful place!  All the staff are friendly, extremely caring and supportive. Beginners feel especially welcome.   Judging by the
number of other repeat clients I see there, I think many people would agree the classes at The Bo Tree are good for the mind, spirit, and body!   JF

I love the Bo Tree.  Ive practiced yoga loyally for 18 years, and Meghan & Heather at The Bo Tree are two of the best teacher I’ve had.  I love the style and spirit of the center.  It’s loving and welcoming and it radiates the true spirit of yoga.  Susan Walker

If youre new, or you love hatha yoga but hate feeling drained afterwards, take a class with Heather Lawrence (EC, Davis Holistic Center or Bo Tree). Shes a wonderful instructor, she accommodates for multiple levels, and shes one of the most relaxed and pleasant people Ive ever met. Users/AnsateJones AnsateJones

After long days at the lab or in class, I really look forward to Megans strong positive energy at The Bo Tree. She is really an incredible yoga teacher. Her classes really rejuvenate me. Betty

20061222 14:48:14 nbsp There are some fantastic yoga instructors at the experimental college. I was going to the ARC because it was nearby, but EC really won me over. Ive also noticed you could construct about 45 months worth of yoga with introductory deals around Davis.  Users/AmyGoogenspa

20080824 13:21:00 nbsp The Bo Tree has managed to survive the departure of some excellent teachers this spring.  Debbie E is still there and she rocks! Users/BeenThere

20100212 11:29:59 nbsp The Bo Tree really is a wonderful place. Debbie indeed is awesome!! But everyone there that Ive met is extremely warm and welcoming, especially for beginners. They are patient and kind and dont make you feel excluded. Users/dizzyditz

20100516 21:56:09 nbsp If anyone wants to give AcroYoga (Acrobatics, Yoga, and Thai Massage) a shot this summer, hit me up and we can play in the park. Besides that I recommend Bikram Yoga Davis and Barefoot Yoga Studio (particularly Rebecca) for classes. Users/MeganK

20100517 17:40:10 nbsp If your going to do yoga, go all out and hit up the bikram  Users/StevenDaubert

20110423 20:05:59 nbsp I recommend Power Vinyasa Flow at the FIT House (I am the teacher)! Users/WendiMcCaskill

20121207 15:59:53 nbsp I work at Get Fit Davis, and try to hire some of the best Yoga teachers in Davis for our Yoga classes. UCD students would just have to pay $25/month for a full membership and they could take unlimited Yoga classes and any other classes that Get Fit Davis offers!  Users/ErwinNguyen
