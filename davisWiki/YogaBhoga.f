Describe Users/YogaBhoga here.

20100702 00:39:35 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki.  I deleted your comment on the Barefoot Yoga Studio page because some people (myself included) felt that the latter part of it was highly inappropriate.  Please feel free to explain the comment if you think it should remain at Barefoot Yoga Studio/Talk.  If you scroll down on that page, youll find your comment and a couple of peoples thoughts on it.

Please also consider the importance of using your RealName.  It will help you to establish an identity here and give more weight to your comments.  Anonymity coupled with pretty serious diagnoses (i.e. unsupported and rather outrageous accusations) are a bad recipe.  You can close this account using the settings link at the top of the page, and create a new one quite easily. Users/TomGarberson

20100702 14:33:34 nbsp Normally Id say that we are all equal editors on the wiki, but Im no longer going to say that. Editors who dont establish identity have an unfair power when they make serious accusations. Yes, someone removed your comment and that is an action that the Wiki Community tries to avoid as much as possible. Unfortunately some people have taken advantage of the ability to create anonymous accounts and not establish any identity and put other editors in very difficult positions with their words. If the problem is that serious either stand behind your accusation, or take it to the proper authorities. Users/JasonAller

20101027 12:47:00 nbsp I dont log in all that often. I have good reasons for being semianonymous. In the case discussed, the total time has been 5 years and multiple interactions with the individual. What may seem outrageous on its face is not necessarily so.  Users/YogaBhoga

20101027 12:50:51 nbsp I dont log in all that often. I have good reasons for being semianonymous. In the case discussed, the total time has been 5 years and multiple interactions with the individual. What may seem outrageous on its face is not necessarily so. I have gone back and triple checked my concerns and come away even more filled with disquiet. Please note that the authorities operate under some very heavy restrictions, much more so than private citizens. Parties used to fencing with the authorities are well versed in exactly what those restrictions are and are careful to step around them.  Users/YogaBhoga

20101027 13:55:50 nbsp The problem is that your comment crosses the border into Slander (if untrue).  When this happens it is essential you establish a strong identity so the person who may be victim of your comments can refute them.  When you remain fairly anonymous it means that the business owner has no way to really defend himself properly.  Youre making some pretty serious and personal accusations here which is why wiki editors removed them.   Users/OliviaY
