About Us
Yogurtland is a selfserve frozen yogurt shop that offers a wide array of premium flavors that range from the ever popular tart to the more exotic such as passion fruit and guava. This location offers twelve different flavors including dairyfree options like the Hibiscus Passion Sorbet, and NSA (No Sugar Added) choices such as the French Vanilla.  In addition, what gives the yogurt its creamy taste is the real milk produced by their own dairy farms. Yogurtland yogurt is fortified with vitamins C and vitamin D, as well as six different probiotics and active cultures that make it not only a delicious treat, but a healthy and refreshing one also.

At 39 cents an ounce, Yogurtland is the least expensive retail source of frozen yogurt (see the frozen yogurt page for a price comparison). In a sense, it is both light on your stomach and your wallet. The location is situated between Dos Coyotes and Jacks Urban Eats and makes for the perfect place to get some afterdinner dessert. They have a convenient number of tables and chairs and (sometimes) music. They also have an ice cold water dispenser (free to everyone) that is often infused with strawberries or watermelon.

They held their Grand Opening on June 1st, 2013. They stated that they would give out free frozen yogurt from 10AM to 1PM but, because of the huge turnout, ended up extending it to 5PM . On this hot summer day, the line was said to be a mile long...Later that day they had a BOGO offer from 5PM to Close. They had a notsogrand, abrupt closing on or about August 17 2014 when the store was simply closed and shuttered and the sign was removed. This caused many Davis residents to wonder: where can we possibly go now to get frozen yogurt?

They moved into the former Cold Stone Creamery location.

20140209 21:57:23 nbsp This is one of the cheapest frozen yogurt stores in Davis. They offer free flavored water and they have many promotions and buy one get one free coupons. Love it!  Users/YoungResident

20140413 14:39:35 nbsp Yogurtland is always clean and you always get flavors that are true to their description. I think they are the cheapest in Davis which is pretty nice. The only thing I dont like about it is that you have to ask for sample cups and get a key to use the restroom _ Users/MichelleKwon

20140806 11:58:16 nbsp This yogurt is very good, it seems to be a cut above other yogurt.  I would put it on par with pinkberry. Users/DagonJones
