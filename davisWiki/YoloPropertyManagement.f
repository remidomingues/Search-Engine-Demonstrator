You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you.  Or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here.  My names Evan, pleased to meet you.  I restored all those reviews you deleted... just because you can doesnt mean its either ethical or nice to delete somebody elses review.  Everybody can see everybody elses edits here, so it stands out pretty clearly when you try to whitewash an entry.  Please give those people the respect to voice their opinions, and feel free to reply to them.  This is a community built and maintained resource, and the community wrote a quick start for business owners that might help you.  You can read it Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner by clicking here.   And once again, welcome to the wiki... if you have questions, just ask, and the community of people here (which includes you now!) will try to help. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20100507 15:00:35 nbsp Hey, Dana... good to talk to you!  Im going to go ahead and archive the old entries on those three complexes.  If you have any others, you can try to copy the format I am using (its easier once you see it done), or just ask, and somebody can help you out. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20100507 15:11:03 nbsp Hello again Evan.  My apologies for misunderstanding Wiki Etiquette.  Thank you for helping me understand exactly what the website is about.  If you dont mind, please archive all the comment for Saratoga West Apartments, Glacier Point Apartments and the Aspen Village Apartments outside of the last year.  There are very outdated posts that are irrelevant to our communities today.  The owners would like to know in the future what sort of recourse do we have other than replying to someones comment that is posted anonymously and is slanderous?  Thanks for your help and Ill look for the changes Monday. Users/YoloPropertyManagement
  Already done!  Editing is pretty easy here on the wiki.  As for comments, the internet address is available, so if youre looking to file a lawsuit, you can easily track any edit down to the individual who made it if you have a court order... although slander is a pretty hard thing to show (since they have to knowingly be telling a falsehood, rather than just stating a harsh opinion  and thats just friendly discussion; Im not a lawyer or anything like that).  If its just something nasty thats of questionable taste (a personal attack, for instance), click the Talk icon on the entry to discuss the issue, and everybody can discuss if the comment has merit.  Community consensus generally determines things like that. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20100507 18:10:52 nbsp Doesnt Sherrie still work at Saratoga West?  Not all those comments are irrelevant if theyre referring to the same person  even if the parent company changes hands, its still the same person in the office :P Users/EdWins

20110214 16:11:53 nbsp Hello EdWins.  My appologies, I have not logged onto our account since last May apparently! Sheri works at our Aspen Village location.  Shirlee is at our Saratoga West location.   Users/YoloPropertyManagement

20111117 11:02:26 nbsp Sorry for the confusion regarding your user name. This year there has been a growing community consensus that organizational accounts should be disabled outright instead of given a choice to continue as they were in the past. Please keep in mind that you are not being banned. You havent done anything wrong; its just that the policies have changed, so to speak. We highly encourage you to continue editing the wiki by signing up again using your real name. Users/ScottMeehleib
