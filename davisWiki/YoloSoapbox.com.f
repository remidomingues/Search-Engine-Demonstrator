Yolo Soapbox was a Yolo County political discussion site.  Covering political and social issues throughout the county, www.yolosoapbox.com is a forum site where users sound off on whats important to them.  After a great start in April 2006, the site averaged hundreds of visitors everyday.  By 2008, it was gone.

Current issues include PG&E and SMUD, the Frank Sieferman vs. Matt Rexroad vs. Brenda Cedarblade supervisorial race in Woodland, police review in Davis, and more.

Heres what it looks like in my browser (firefox) on OS X:

 
20060601 21:42:32 nbsp Yes, its really messing up with Firefox Users/AndrewRamos

20060601 22:21:20 nbsp You have to use Explorer to view it correctly.  This wasnt the case until last week when something was changed. Users/SharlaDaly

20060602 17:00:03 nbsp Problem seems to have been fixed now.  Blog on! Users/AndrewRamos
  The table still runs off the edge in firefox which is way obnoxious. Its not worth scrolling right on every page just to read the thoughts of townies who are even more incredibly bitter at everything than I am. Users/TravisGrathwell

20070504 00:09:56 nbsp May be dead.  Sends to a DNS reseller as of 5/1/07 Users/NotTires
