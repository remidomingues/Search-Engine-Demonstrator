The Yolo Airporter is a small Taxi Services shuttle service providing transportation to and from the Sacramento and Bay Area airports and locations within Yolo County.  Their prices are competitive with SuperShuttle and they usually provide faster service.  As of April 2009, their web site is complete with online reservations (online reservations give a $5 discount). Their van service has been operational for several years. As of December 2008, a ride to the Sacramento International Airport from Davis costs $20. More fares can be found on their webpage.

As of 8/17/13, this service appears to be nonexistent.

20081129 05:52:17 nbsp Ive gotten two rides from them so far and the service has been good.  The first was for a 6:30am flight and they picked me up at 5:10 instead of 4:15am (the time offered by supershuttle). Users/AceDarling

20090104 17:59:59 nbsp I have also used Yolo Airporter both to Sac and to SFO and their rates were reasonable. Sac $20 and SFO $80 I thought this was decent pricing. They also pick you up on time and they do not charge for luggage like other airporters do. I highly recommend them. Users/manlike

20090613 10:23:33 nbsp They never picked me up for my ride to the airport.  Awful.  Unbelievable.  I booked a ride with them online, then called to confirm because they dont send an email confirmation.  But my flight leaves in little more than an hour, and they havent showed.  Nobody answers their phones either.  This is horrendous.  I hope the cab I had to book at the last minute gets her on time.   Users/katzwest

20090730 22:41:39 nbsp Terrible service. I made reservations a month ago for a ride tomorrow. I get a call 10 minutes ago about how they can no longer provide a ride. They hoped I could find another way to get to SFO, their well wishing is no substitute for actual service. They couldnt even contact another company to get me a ride! WOULD NOT EVEN ATTEMPT TO USE AGAIN! Users/AlexNelson

20090916 14:02:35 nbsp 20090916 Apparently out of business. Made a reservation online, but when I called to confirm, their phone was disconnected (both numbers). Users/cunningham

20091014 18:33:04 nbsp I just called their number because I had a question, and Im vouching for cunningham that both numbers were disconnected. Users/kg18

20091015 08:48:02 nbsp Despite the number being disconnected, I have seen their vans multiple times driving around Woodland in the past week.  Users/AmLin

201018 I think theyre out of business!  Both of their phone numbers are disconnected!  I left an online reservation but got no response.  This weblink & related writeup should probably be removed. Users/genetakahashi

20100827 20:34:44 nbsp And their website seems to be down right now. Users/NaBarry
