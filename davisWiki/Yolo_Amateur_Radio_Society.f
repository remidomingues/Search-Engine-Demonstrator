The Yolo Amateur Radio Society is an Amateur Radio Service group primarily a public service oriented club assisting with communications for many public events around the Sacramento Valley, including the annual Foxys Fall Century and Davis Double Century bike tours.

Monthly meetings are held on the first Tuesday of each month in the classroom building at Explorit Science Center, located at 3141 Fifth Street, in Davis, California. We normally meet at 6:30 p.m. for dinner (arranged by the club), and the meeting begins at 7:30 p.m.

Weekly nets are held on Mondays from 8:309:00 on the Mt. Vaca repeater (147.000 negative offset).

20060304 12:29:44 nbsp not quite an amateur radio question but....does anyone know the radio system info for the City of Daviss radio set up?  I have a scanner but its pretty old, and I think the Citys new system doesnt get picked up.  Have a great day. Users/RocksandDirt

20060304 12:58:36 nbsp The City of Davis has some conventional frequencies assigned to them, but I havent heard anything on them the entire time Ive lived here.
