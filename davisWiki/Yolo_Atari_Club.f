Yolo Atari Club was a retrogaming and Atari enthusiast society that formed in the 1990s and apparently disbanded at some point within the following decade. The club held sporadic gaming and programming events. A paid membership included access to a software lending library, a newsletter, and other Atari resources.

Although seemingly unconnected, the ongoing series of Atari Party Atari Parties fills some of the void left behind by the old clubs demise.
