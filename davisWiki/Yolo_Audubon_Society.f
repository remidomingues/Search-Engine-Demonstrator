It is the mission of Yolo Audubon Society to foster an appreciation of Birds and Bird Watching birds and other town wildlife wildlife through educational programs and field trips, bring conservation issues to public awareness, and act to preserve Yolo County bird life and habitat.

There is a group of birders that meets every Thursday lunchtime at the UC Davis Arboretum; more info herehttp://www.ucdavis.edu/spotlight/0309/birder_brains.html. Since the meeting location changes, you should ask to join the listserve if interested (email alkent@ucdavis.edu).
