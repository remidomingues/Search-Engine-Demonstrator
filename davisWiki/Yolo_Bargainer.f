 Back to the actual Bargainer 
The main purpose of Yolo Bargainer is to get more exposure for local businesses in Davis and to promote community shopping.  Yolo Bargainer serves up Discounts and Freebies great deals while also supporting local businesses and charities. They pretty much create an allaroundwin situation: Customers get a great deal, Davis companies get new customers and local charities get more contributions.

Heres how it works:

 1. The customer goes to the site and checks out the great offer. (The Coupon!)
 1. If customers like the deal, they buy the deal.
 1. Once enough customers buy it, about 10 or 15 people, then the deal is on!
 1. Davis companies get new customers and business stays in Davis!!

The best part is that for every purchase made, Yolo Bargainer raises money for a charity that the customer selects. The customer always has three options for which charity to support and Yolo Bargainer is always open for new suggestions for additional ones.

By the way, if not enough people buy it, customers dont get charged a thing.  But its still a good way to advertise for local businesses!!
If you are a local business and want info you should send a request to their email. They offer free advertisement!
