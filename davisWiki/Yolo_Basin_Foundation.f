The Yolo Basin Foundation  http://www.yolobasin.org/ website  was founded in 1990 as a community based organization to assist in the establishment of the Yolo Bypass Wildlife Area. Our most significant cooperation is with the California Department of Fish & Wildlife, who currently manages the Yolo Bypass Wildlife Area (YBWA). Yolo Basin Foundation continues as the communication link between many people and organizations involved in creating wetlands and managing the land in the Yolo Bypass.


A principal goal of the Foundation is facilitating environmental education in the YBWA for all ages. In August 1997, we held the first of our Discover the Flyway teacher workshops, which introduces area teachers to the Wildlife Area and prepares them to bring their classes out for exciting and productive field studies.


In its first year, the Discover the Flyway school program hosted 800 students between October 1997 and June of 1998. Since our pilot year, the school program has expanded to over 4,000 Kindergarten through 12thgrade students annually. Yolo Basin Foundation staff, interns and dedicated volunteers assist students in handson learning activities at our demonstration wetlands and lead students on exploratory Wildlife Area walks.

In addition to our popular Discover the Flyway program, Yolo Basin Foundation is the sponsoring nonprofit organization for California Duck Days, publishes the Yolo Flyway newsletter, brings wetlands education to the classroom with our Wild About Wetlands kits, introduces the public to natural places in the community through public field trips, and hosts the Flyway Nights speaker series.


The Foundation facilitates the Yolo Bypass Working Group meetings, which provide a focused opportunity for farmers, land owners and agencies within the Yolo Bypass to discuss Bypass related issues as well as provide guidance and opinions on such issues.

Join the Yolo Basin Foundation to learn about and view live bats, native to Northern California, at one of our popular summer events.
