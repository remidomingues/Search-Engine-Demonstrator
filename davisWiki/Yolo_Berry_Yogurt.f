YoloBerry Yogurt is a selfserve yogurt shop.  It serves six different flavors of http://www.yocream.com/ yocream frozen yogurt, always including original/tart with a number of flavors rotating, and 101 toppings, including fresh fruit, to go with them.  In addition to the original/tart flavor, there is always the option of one nondairy sorbet flavor (note: completely vegan and lactosefree for those with dietary restrictions), as well as the triedandtrue classics: chocolate and vanilla.  Pumpkin flavor is often available during the fall and is totally yummy (if you like that sort of thing).  Both the yogurt and the toppings are selfserve and are charged for by weight. They have a card where you can buy 8 yogurts and get 1 free.

They have plans for a balcony with lots of comfy chairs, and live performances from musicians and other folks as well.

This is the third of a sequence of yogurt shops to open up in Davis in the past two years and is owned by a former manager (Lee) of Sudwerk.

When they first opened they had a webcams webcam where you could watch people dispense themselves frozen yogurt from the safety of your own home.  The webcam proved controversial and was removed.

They replaced the shortlived JoJos Cafe.

   Gotta love ice cream, gelato, or frozen yogurt on a hot Summer day!

20080625 22:15:36 nbsp I think there should be some yogurt tasting comparisons when this place opens. I will not be a judge because I work at Yogurt Shack.  Volunteers? Users/JackkiCox

20080811 08:37:08 nbsp Does anyone know when this place is opening? Users/HDLee

20080916 21:52:06 nbsp Mid October I believe Users/Vdavis

20081018 15:30:02 nbsp Theyre open now. They have 101 toppings, and some innovative ones like apple pie filling. I got a mango sorbet/original tart mix with Heath Bar Crunch and coconut topping. Yum! Their yogurt is more creamy and less tart than Swirl, but I havent been to Yogurt Shack, so I dont know how it compares to them. Id definitely go here again! Users/MonicaWilliams

20081019 10:03:50 nbsp This place is  amazing. I went there yesterday, which was their first complete day open and I love it! Ill be back on a regular basis. Also, the owners are soooooo nice and friendly. They have a ton of flavors and more to come. All of their yogurts are top quality and their toppings are really creative. Two thumbs up! Youll be seeing me there  Users/AppleBlossom

20081022 23:05:26 nbsp Took the kids there the other day... very good creamy yogurt. Better than Yogurt Shack in my opinion, but different than Swirls/Cultive.  Lots of choices for toppings, and good overall value too.  Best Mochi toppings by far... owner says they were made fresh, and you can taste the quality.  I would recommend it to those looking for sweet creamy yogurt.  My kids loved it. Users/Aaron.Curtin

20081024 12:51:40 nbsp Very creamy and delicous yogurt!! They have an awesome variety of toppings. Also the owners are very friendly, makes for a very comfortable environment. Will definately be going back. Users/AngelaGerould

20081024 22:59:36 nbsp this is the new yogurt joint. Its kind of in a wierd location but good thing i spotted it. Was really great, the best thing was the toppings. I love the flavored mochi balls. THey are delicious. Also their yogurt is def. not ice cream like some other place in davis hint hint but it was so good. and on top of everything the price is realll cheap! check this joint out. Users/thizzling

20081025 15:22:09 nbsp I tried Yolo Berry out for the first time yesterday, and it was delicious! I appreciate places that have the tart and the more traditional fro yo, since I am not a big fan of the tart. Their yogurt is really creamy. They have a great selection of toppings and my husband loves that they have cookie chunks.  Users/AmLin

20081029 17:57:55 nbsp I went in a week ago and enjoyed a delicious cheesecake yogurt topped with fruit. Delicious!  In my opinion better than the Yogurt Shack. Users/Magster

20081029 21:10:18 nbsp I went here recently and it was really good. They had a good variety of flavors (pumpkin and cookies and creme were memorable), but what really impressed me with their selection. I really loved the apple pie filling on my yogurt, which was warm and went really well with it. I was really pleasantly surprised with the mochi they had. Their selection is a lot more than Yogurt Shack, which used to be my favorite dessert place in Davis, but Im definitely going here now. The yogurt was also noticeably cheaper than what I was used to paying. Users/JaimeG

20081029 23:29:39 nbsp Yolo Berry is the cheapest yogurt join in town, has more toppings than the other two, multiple kinds of mochi, a gift card that has a better dollar for dollar value than the stamp cards at the other two, and is super convenient if one is at Farmers Market. Winner: Yolo Berry Yogurt! Users/MichaelAWoods

20081103 20:11:51 nbsp Sooo good! Best yogurt place in town!  An insane amount of toppings, and really well priced.  Plus the owners are always there and they are really nice. Users/Selby

20081103 20:59:59 nbsp love the pie filling, mochi, and chocolate syrup toppings. If you are a health nut, they still have plenty of fruit toppings.   Users/justinhu

20081105 16:59:10 nbsp I work at Yogurt Shack.  Im not going to say anything mean about yoloberry but there are a few things I would like to comment on.  First Yoloberry uses YOCREAM brand yogurt.  We use that brand for most of our flavors. Second it is only 1 penny cheaper so you are only saving 16 cents a pound.   Users/JackkiCox
 In response to JackkiCoxs comment about Yolo Berry only being a little bit cheaper, it seems that her comment is a little imprecise. Yogurt Shack has a two tiered pricing structure (depending on which toppings you want) and therefore an individual yogurt there may be more expensive than she claims. Yolo Berry toppings are all one price. —Etherington
   I dont think the more expensive bulk candy at Yogurt Shack is meant to be used as a topping.  Its just candy you can buy and have bagged separately.  If toppings werent all the same price, it would be difficult to figure out how much to charge. Users/JonathanLawton

20081111 14:41:28 nbsp I think Yolo Berry is by far the best frozen yogurt place in Davis. Their toppings and yogurt are superior to those at Yogurt Shack and they have great fresh fruit like the place formerly known as Swirl. I think the service is excellent and I get to make my yogurt just the way I like it. Im so happy this place opened in Davis.  Users/Etherington


20081112 11:28:38 nbsp I tried yolo berry last night later, Blew me a way. The original tart yogurt was the one I settled on, it has great tartness, the peach was a little lighter but I wanted something with teeth. Then after skipping past all the candy toppings I hit the back wall, and once again went nuts. Hardshell (even though I passed on that one), multiple different flavors of pie filling, cherry, peach, apple! They had berry sauces, and fresh fruit / cheescake! I talked with the owner and even though he takes a hit on the fresh fruit it is still worth it on general principal to him. That is major, major points. Good atmosphere and cheerful employees. Watch out Swirl... Users/StevenDaubert

20081112 16:40:58 nbsp Fortuitous circumstances prompted me to try this place last night.  I highly recommend this place.  Im not normally a yogurt person, but it is absolutely delicious.  i second Users/StevenDauberts comments.  I had exactly the same thing he did.  And the owner is deeply concerned about providing the highest quality of service and ingredients to his customersregardless of cost.  Also, the yogurt has live cultures.  He even has the permit handy. Users/CurlyGirl26

20081112 22:12:38 nbsp Pretty good, enjoyed the yogurt with all my stuff in it. I like that you can chose what size cup you wish to fill, and that candy is the same price as everything else. The mochi and the pie filings are different and quite good, and I didnt try any but there are a lot of sauces. I like this place, nice atmosphere and good yogurt. I think that its a matter of personal preference or possibly location between Yolo Berry and Yogurt Shack. This place measures up about the same (Id have a hard time choosing between the two. Pie filling pulls me to Yolo Berry.)  Users/ChristyMarsden

20081112 22:58:17 nbsp I really like the tartyness in the yogurt (tasted like Swirl/Cultives which I also really like).  Question: if Yogurt Shack uses the same yogurt, how come theirs usually taste sweeter? Do they add sugar? Users/geezlouisexyz
    Dannon provides a wide selection of yogurt varieties.  Its kind of like wine: each type has a distinct flavor.  They may use the same supplier but different yogurt.

20081116 14:21:08 nbsp I just love this place.  Its all the good things about Swirl/Cultivé and Yogurt Shack combined (good yogurt + selfserve/cheap).  Before coming here, Swirl was my favorite yogurt place because the yogurt at Yogurt Shack was always super disappointing and faketasting. But now that Yolo Berry gives me a selfserve option and has tasty, creamy yogurt like Swirl, I cant say no.  The Peanut Butter and New York Cheesecake flavors are personally my favorite, though the tart flavor is delicious too.  So glad this place is here!

Also, I talked to one of the owners last weekend, and he said that come Spring, theyll have an outdoor seating area. Users/WinButler

20081116 14:58:25 nbsp I like this place, but I will still keep going to Yogurt Shack. The flavor is not too different, the latter uses the biodegradable spoons and cups. Users/jsg718

20081117 08:20:28 nbsp After my 2nd trip here yesterday, I am convinced this will probably be the only place Ill go for yogurt anymore. I even like it better than Big Spoon, which I always rated higher than Yougrt Shack. Better tasting yogurt, more topping choices, and definitely seems cheaper than anywhere else to me. It would be great if we could get a Yolo Berry in Woodland...we are yogurtless over here!! Users/AmLin

20081117 13:04:43 nbsp I for one am interested in the patio, apparently they want to do some minor music venue type stuff as well! Users/StevenDaubert

20081120 17:46:38 nbsp In response to JSG718s comment about going to Yogurt Shack over yoloberry because of the biodegradable spoons and cups. I agree that having those is a great idea. But did you notice that when youre down with your eco friendly spoons and cups they go into the general trash? So theyre not actually getting recycled.  Users/SarahDavidson

20081121 13:32:25 nbsp Yogurt Shacks cups and spoons can only be composted.  We have yet to find a source that can handle the amount of cups and spoons we use.  If you or a friend has a composting pile or any information on composting in Davis we would love to talk to you.  Also we always encourage our customers to bring in their own container to cut back on waste. Users/JackkiCox
 When customers bring in their own containers, do you tare the scale?  Also, have you contacted Project Compost on campus?  I went to one of their worm composting workshops once and they seemed pretty serious in general about composting! Users/JonathanLawton

20081121 22:09:14 nbsp Yolo Berry is the best in town! Love walking to the park after filling up on delicious fresh fruit! Users/NinasStudio

20081203 19:47:55 nbsp Hello everyone! I just stopped by today b/c I was craving for yogurt & finally decided to try this place... I usually go to YOGURT SHACK for their yogurts.

Overall, the place is decent & I do agree that YOLO BERRY is less pricey compared to the other yogurt places in town.  Personally, I prefer YOGURT SHACK b/c they have a bigger selection of crunchy nuts & fruits which I like but they are a little more expensive.  I havent tried Swirls yet so I cant compare the difference there.  I usually dont like to add any sort of sweet treats or at least a MINIMAL amount of treats to my yogurt & I thought there werent many selections that I like.  Some choices I noticed that werent in YOGURT SHACK like the different pie fillings, saucy syrups, fruit mochi, etc...I am sure lots of customers like it but I know I wont put it in my yogurt. They have most of the choices YOUGURT SHACK has like gummy bears, oreo cookies, chocolate sprinkles, smashed candy bars, etc... again I dont like having too many sweet treats in my yogurt but it was nice to see the huge selection YOLO BERRY has to offer.  I enjoyed the yogurt I bought but I like the flavors @ YOGURT SHACK more.  Other than that, this is a good spot for a snack with friends or an alternative yogurt stop & their yogurt favors are pretty tasty & rich( TART flavor is very popular). Users/AlyceeLeung

20090114 00:41:39 nbsp Basically a combo of Cultives yogurt and Yogurt Shacks toppings. The yogurt is good, but theyre tangy flavor isnt as good as Cultives. Good selection of moshi. Beware! The weight adds up really fast! I ended up paying $4 for a small with a few toppings. Youre better off splitting a large yogurt with toppings with a friend at Cultive for about $6. Users/AmanpreetSingh

20090115 18:22:35 nbsp WOW! Sounds like an awesome, good priced place to go! Must check it out and get back with a response.  Users/BeachBabe

20090119 10:44:32 nbsp This is the third yogurt place in Davis now, and it is one of the best. Their snickerdoddle falvor and choc make for a nice combination with brownies and Reeses Peanut Butter cups.You will not be dissapointed. Users/AnneBrowning

20090125 18:20:10 nbsp This place is cheaper than yogurt shack and has endless topping choices, anything from fruit to sauces and chocolate galore!  But they need to bring back their pumpkin yogurt, AMAZING!   Users/fffashion13

20090127 00:41:21 nbsp the Tart continues to blow me away, and I still cant get over the cherry pie filling and the cheesecake pieces / fruit station. I went in today and talked with Lee and it was very rewarding, he really cares about the customer and the experience which is why I constantly return Users/StevenDaubert

20090129 03:06:15 nbsp AMAZING YOGURT PLACE. Better price and great quality. Id put this above the other yogurt places Users/JasonKong

20090215 22:04:55 nbsp I like Yolo berry if I just used their fresh fruits as toppings.  Warning, do not eat any of their candy/chocolate/cookies/etc.  They may look tempting but they dont taste like the normal thing because they are OLD.  Ive gone there twice and had the same experience. My bf got some sour apple and sour belt candies (whatever their names really are) and they were extremely hard. I got their Reeses cup, brownies, and Kit Kat bar, all of which tasted old. So.. I just recommend sticking to the fruit + yogurt which is really good and a good deal. Users/renee415
  Ive been to Yolo Berry several times now.  Everything from the fruit to the candy is fresh.  I know because Ive tried them all.  The place is always packed when I go there.  They constantly have to refill the stations.  The stuff cant possibly stay in the store for very long.  You say that the candy is OLD and HARD.  You got the yogurt, right?  You put the candy on the yogurt?  You know that the yogurt makes the candy cold and hard, right?  Doesnt make the candy old. Users/CurlyGirl26
  Also if you perceived a bad experience, why didnt you bring it to the attention of the manager? They love to correct anything that is wrong, dont bite your tongue!  Users/StevenDaubert

20090220 22:33:51 nbsp i love this place!  good deal, endless displays of delicious toppings from sauces to mochi to fruit to candy!  I tried a cheesecake and cake batter mix flavored ice cream with cookie dough, cheesecake bits, mochi, cherry pie filling, hot fudge, white chocolate sauce, and it was the best!   Im definitely going there again.  Users/psanchez

20090314 22:45:29 nbsp It seems like the real yogurt lovers prefer Cultivé Frozen Yogurt.  But I am not a real yogurt lover, and I prefer Yolo Berry.  I also prefer being able to include exactly the amount of yogurt I want and exactly amount the toppings I want.  Yolo Berry has lots of topping choices; more than Yogurt Shack, I think.  Otherwise, Im still undecided which I prefer.  One bonus in Yolo Berrys favor is that you have a much nicer place to sit outside than the Shack  hell, you have all of Central Park. Users/CovertProfessor

20090315 00:06:04 nbsp Hands down the best Yogurt place in town.  Great location, great service, and great tasting yogurt.   Users/CurlyGirl26

20090315 13:32:27 nbsp I just noticed the cost: ouch at 39 cents per ounce.  Thats super lame in trying to minimally beat out Yogurt Shack. Users/EdWins
     Then yogurt shack is now being lame by beating yolo berry yogurt by one more cent (38cents). And still there are more people going to yolo berry yogurt Users/babiiangee
         Yolo Berry started the 1 cent undercut ;) But cheers. Hopefully they both continue to go down to a bit more reasonable price. Users/Edwins ES

20090325 14:51:57 nbsp Went here last week. The yogurt was very good and the number of toppings was very impressive. Im going back.  Users/AnnieSirrah

20090413 18:16:04 nbsp Awesome yogurt and endless toppings! Users/Churro615

20090422 19:15:39 nbsp at first i thought it was just another yogurt shack with a bunch of candy and sweet toppings but i have been coming here often after i discovered the fruits in the back. i like both yolo berry and cultive, but i think this place is better in terms of friendly service and the fact that its self serve.  Users/skinnyfatgirl

20090511 15:19:44 nbsp I love the original tart at Cultive but they are sooo expensive versus what I can get and be satisfied with self serving at Yoloberry.  I also just discovered they honor competitor punch cards so I turned in my old cultive one and got a free yogurt.  Yay! Users/OliviaY

20090528 22:16:45 nbsp I just went here tonight and the sorbet and vanilla yogurt mix is really nice, reminded me of a raspberry cheesecake. They have actual fresh fruit and chunks of cheesecake to enhance the whole bowl of frozenness. I couldnt believe i have never been here before. The ambiance was really relaxed and sociable, there were lots of people outside and we were able to grab a cozy little bench and enjoy our treats. Note to others out there who dont know, chewy candies harden when cold. My boyfriend had never experienced cold candy before and found out the hard way.   Users/mowtov

20090612 14:48:36 nbsp I came here for a straight week trying to find a flaw with this place.  All I need to say is that this IS the place for frozen yogurt.  So many topping choices and they serve the tart flavor.  I love Yolo Berry forever.  10/10 Users/strawberry

20090617 16:15:47 nbsp I think yoloberry is super great. Tons of flavor/topping options, however I would like to see them offer at least one sugar free option of yogurt. There are some sugar free topping options, but no yogurt :( Users/efloughran

20090621 00:54:38 nbsp This place is the bomb. Although, to be honest, I think the only thing that makes it beat the other places is a) self serving (seems to be kind of a big deal for everyone, including me) and b) charging by ounce. I know other places do the latter, but being a former swirl customer it was a new and interesting concept.  Users/Babhari

20090702 16:49:12 nbsp I am totally addicted to yoloberry!  I wish they had cake batter more often, but then I would prob never leave this place!  It totally puts all the other yogurt shops to shame!  Delicious!!! Users/Audrey13

20090721 14:01:32 nbsp YOLO BERRY IS THE Absolute BEST!  Am a picky FroYo eater because I know my Frozen Yogurts! I don’t even know why those other Yogurt Places even bother to stay open! PLEASE CHECK OUT YOLO BERRY when you’re DAVIS! YOU WONT BE Disappointed, I Promise!  Users/Macco

20090721 18:01:53 nbsp I love the big variety of toppings.  Its also pretty cool that they charge you by the weight of your yogurt.  Thumbs up! Users/KenjiYamada

20090804 00:36:44 nbsp Just like the other yogurt stores in town, the flavors choices are lacking, but they are very tasty.  I much prefer the selfserve as I can choose what the multiple flavors I want in the quantity I wish.  Prices are acceptable.  Great during hot summer evenings.   Users/BenLee

20090901 02:32:03 nbsp yolo berry yogurt is the best i have tasted.. they even have dollar off coupons any purchase of $2 or more! and they have stamp cards! i know the other places have them too buy yolo berry only requires 8 stamps for a free one :) Users/yummytummy
  Where can you get the coupons?   Users/CovertProfessor

20090902 20:01:10 nbsp i officially hate this place now. im never bringing my students or my club here again.


theres a particular employee at yoloberry who has absolutely NO CLASS, NO BRAINS AND NO RESPECT. i never get angry with people, but for the first time, i actually screamed at a stranger.

shes a brunette, with a rotund figure and never smiles. perhaps she was condescending towards me because im asian. but whatever the case, she was too much for me and i called the manager. its kinda overated, the only reason it tastes better is because it has so much more sugar than all the other places in davis Users/emme
  Im not sure where you get your information about the sugar, but comparing the nutritional facts on the YoCream and Cultive web sites shows that Yoloberrys original tart yogurt actually has 1g less sugar per 1/2cup serving than Cultives tart yogurt.  YogurtShack doesnt list their nutritional information online.   Users/MonicaWilliams

20090907 16:12:01 nbsp This place is disgusting, their mochi is so nasty, it tastes artifical and plastic
and its just so tackylooking Users/alexhope
  It has never steered me wrong, the vendor is a older lady in sac who handmakes it iirc, I think your beef lies with her!  Users/StevenDaubert

20090913 22:24:21 nbsp I came here with a friend a while ago. From what I recall, it was pretty tasty yogurt, although I personally just happen to prefer Cultive (its tartier IMHO). But the variety in toppings here is awesome. Users/kthrnngo

20091005 23:50:58 nbsp its funny hearing people complain about their experiences with the employees.  You have virtually ZERO contact with them, so exactly why are you complaining?  Anyways, Yolo Berry is open till 11:30pm (confirmed with employees), the website still says 11pm. Users/shraken

20091006 21:41:26 nbsp Im personally really creeped out by the streaming video footage inside the store.  This was my favorite place to go but now Im going to avoid it.  Sorry guys :( Users/OliviaY
 Are you serious Olivia? Your going to let a WebCam that no one even looks at OR is for the public to see if they can avoid a HUGE LINE?! Determine your FINAL decision on not coming to YOLO BERRY? WOW that’s GREAT! ( NOT REALLY but to each their own) I LOVE THE WEBCAM thanks for thinking in that way, you were the 1st ONE CONGRATS!
  And what is that way?  Im perfectly entitled to my opinion but thanks for the constructive criticism. Users/OliviaY
   Your WELCOME! My only apology is that I couldnt respond to you message as soon as it hit the air. “That WAY” means YOU thinking “Creepy” over a silly little web cam and the fact that this WAS YOUR Favorite place BEFORE but have changed your mind because of the WEB CAM. If YoloBerry was really your Favorite Place, which for MANY OF US IT IS, you wouldn’t have done this. But like I said to each their own. I would have NEVER expected this to happen. But apparently it did. Well then this would be the last message I post to you Olivia because this is not the proper place nor manner to be discussing this. I only did this because I haven’t let Yoloberry’s new installment affect my LOVE for their FRO YO(Business). And no one ever Forbid your entitlement so please continue to write freely because I will NOT, to you, at least. First time since my arrival as a student last Fall quarter that I have gotten into an argument/ flight and via internet none the less. HOW Hilarious. Users/Macco
    If yoloberry was really your favorite place... it was but I guess Im just not as fanatical as some about a cold dessert option to overlook what I find to be a dangerous step by businesses toward loss of privacy.  If I wanted my life broadcasted on a camera to whoever chooses to watch it Id try out for the real world.  Users/OliviaY


20091019 20:38:38 nbsp Congradulations for one year serving fairly healthy yogurt. Nice staff, interesting owners and lots of fun (I even wrote a poem for the owners!) though I find the WEB cam troubling because I personally feel it is an invasion of privacy. Keep up the popular flavors for the students, etc. And dont forget the almonds and Chocolate. Users/GarySaylin

20091020 23:04:44 nbsp Best frozen yogurt in town.  Yum! Users/IDoNotExist

20091021 22:43:08 nbsp I find the live cam feed from the YoloBerry website to be a little creepy. Users/Ami

20091023 19:39:22 nbsp
I agree with Olivia wholeheartedly.  I was a regular (coming in at least four times a week) and now I no longer visit because of the live internet feed.  I believe another problem is that most of the customers do not know that they are on a webcam.  Patrons need to be informed by the business (e.g. a posted sign) so that they can decide for themselves whether or not they want to be on the internet every time they pick up a yogurt.
 Users/Pooka
its just aimed at the dispensers, you guys are overreacting. its not like it has facebook style tags that tells you who is there, keep your back to it if your really freaked out about random people randomly looking at you (it happens all the time every day, but when its over the internet its a problem?!) Daubert
It is creepy (to me) when you find out someone in the CS dept is using it as part of a project with facial recognition.  Computer takes photos  photos cross referenced on facebook  get a message from random creeper showing he knows when you go to yoloberry  not something I like the idea of.  I also just dont think a business should get to use me for free publicity which is what the camera is.   Anyway people who dont mind can continue going, they have an amazing peanut butter flavor.  I just am not interested and apparently from some of the employees I spoke with, neither are they thrilled by it....Users/OliviaY
the plot thickens, hence why I dont use social networking, or I dont have up to date photos of me  Users/StevenDaubert
     My gf and I both think the webcam thing is pretty weird.  I dont know if it would turn me off the place, but its certainly odd. I just wanted to say that the DavisWiki certainly does work as a social site :P  I stopped using my real name because I started getting recognized at restaurants a few years ago and I certainly didnt want that.  users/edwins ES

20091101 14:41:35 nbsp I saw a car with a yolobry license plate headed Northbound on L. st a couple days ago Users/StevenDaubert

20091101 17:10:11 nbsp Perhaps that was for Sudwerk  a Yolo Brewery... Users/IDoNotExist

20091108 21:46:43 nbsp even though the live food cam is really weird and kinda creepy, we love it here, they have so many toppings and it is cheap. large crowds come often (and of coarse screaming kids), crowding this tiny building and leaving no spots to sit. luckily the park is right across the street and it is really nice to sit in there and eat together. Users/mrandmrs

20091122 17:07:37 nbsp Honestly, I dont think that this is an overreaction.  I really do have a problem with the fact that there are people who will be walking into this store that will not realize that they are on camera.  It bothers me that children are inadvertently being filmed.  I think that it is potentially dangerous and that the owners should rethink their judgement on this project.  A yogurt cam is completely unnecessary.  The yogurt may be good, and the concept of the place, overall, may be nice, but I would rather take my business elsewhere where my image wont be plastered on the internet to be used for a facial recognition program, or utilized by any other opportunists.  In the future, Ill be going to another yogurt establishment where BigYogurtBrother isnt watching. Users/Pooka

20100115 15:25:51 nbsp Awesome place. Definitely in the weekly rotation.   Users/103

20100120 21:43:29 nbsp All right, Im just gonna say it: this place is a Marijuana stoners paradise.  Seriously, you can put warm peanut butter on your strawberry frozen yogurt.

It wasnt clear to me that the place was completely selfserve when I first walked in.  Maybe theyd be well served by some sort of sign, or maybe I was too tired to notice one. Users/PhilipNeustrom

20100123 00:00:04 nbsp I noticed on their Facebook today that they were serving Cookie Dough frozen yogurt for the first time. I tried it, and it was amazing! I have tried all the frozen yogurt places in town and this is the best one, I think. The most toppings, although Id prefer fresher brownies rather than the store bought round ones they serve. Also, the yogurt does seem to separate/melt really quickly.. Otherwise, great place. Users/redbike

20100206 13:25:09 nbsp Great place for yogurt.  I tend to like lowfat over nonfat so at times I would like more of the lowfat options but all in all, I think their yogurt is the best in town.  They have lots of toppings, including fresh fruit.  Sometimes they have fresh bananas.  I care about cleanliness (a LOT) and this place gets high marks!
And youve gotta love any place with a yogurt cam!  :) Users/toriac

20100206 23:22:14 nbsp Great frozen yogurt, the sauces are kept warm and there is a large variety of toppings. The video feed has no effect on the atmosphere, it is a warm place with a friendly staff. This is the only yogurt place to mention in Davis. Users/EdwardRiggins

20100309 15:42:09 nbsp I absolutely love this place! The fruit is fresh and the toppings are crunchy and never stale. I come here at least twice a month.  Users/SFNative2006

20100425 22:15:43 nbsp I love Yoloberry. They have great fruit toppings. I love their berry / fruit flavors. I love that they have hard hat chocolate topping that hardens over my froyo. So good! Users/BryceH

20100524 22:27:33 nbsp You know what they say about doing good business: Location, location, location.  Fine.  Yolo Berry has that one down.  Super close to campus, Farmers Markey, Crepeville, B&B, etc.  The toppings are in great quantity, but the quality leaves something to be desired (whipped cream was NASTY) and the yogurt really wasnt great.  Also, terrible customer service.  The girl who helped me was chatting with her buddies and treated me like I was an annoyance she just wanted to get rid of.  All in all, not so great. Users/AdamV

20100524 22:35:00 nbsp I love Yolo Berry.  Definitely my top frozen yogurt pick in town.  I cant comment on the quality of the whipped cream because I dont like the stuff unless its made fresh.  The toppings, though... great variety, and quite a few really good options.  I highly recommend the little tiny raspberry truffle bits.  Those and the fresh fruit totally make my day whenever I go there. Users/TomGarberson
  Raspberry truffle bits... ooh, I will have to try those.  Which part of the store?  cp
   I think the top row along the same wall as the yogurt machines.  Theyre probably a little left of center.  They dont look like truffles; theyre little chocolate nub thingies.  Worth looking around for, though! tg
    Ill definitely be seeking those out!  Update  found the truffle bits and enjoyed them quite a bit, thanks!  Though as with many chocolate items on yogurt, they were best before they got too cold.  cp

20100613 00:46:58 nbsp whenever i come here, i go straight to the fruit section. every other topping ruins the yogurt flavor. the brownies are yummy though. Users/binladen

20100618 12:54:16 nbsp Best yogurt in Davis by far!!!! Users/ashleyinthemist

20100629 13:35:53 nbsp We really like the outdoor seating at this place. I think the stream of customers outside the store will help entice other customers, good move having a nice and relaxed outdoor area. Employees are friendly and flavor choices are alright. Will be back! Hopefully they stay in business longer than the previous ones.  Users/LeeY

20100629 14:55:19 nbsp Try the tart flavor if you havent yet.  Its the classic plain yogurt flavor, and it really lets the toppings shine.  Om nom nom! Users/TomGarberson

20100917 00:54:11 nbsp on mondays and tuesdays if i crave yogurt.. i go to cultive bcause they have 25 cents and ounce after 6PM.. but if its any other day.. i come here

i love yolo berry and it was the first yogurt place ive ever been to!

i love the location as well (scene wise) because of the park and what not :) Users/sallythatgirl

20101012 13:43:50 nbsp While being further away than the other yogurt establishments in downtown Davis for me, Yolo Berry is my favorite establishment. More selection of yogurt and toppings, the ability to blend two flavors together for a twist, some of the friendliest staff I have experienced in these places and, in my opinion, better prices too.

After visiting Pinkberry, Yogurt Shack and Cultive, my group ended up here and everyone picked up more yogurt here whether they had yogurt at the other places or not. Everyone agreed this is the best yogurt compared to the rest in downtown.  Users/WesP

20101104 10:38:51 nbsp I think this is the best yougurt place. They have a lot of good toppings including chocolate shell. I like the orange shebert. They have heaters outside so you can sit and relax and be warm. Users/JasperD

20101205 15:12:31 nbsp This is definitely the best frozen yogurt place in Davis. I like how its completely self serve (unlike Yogurt Shack) and that they have a  wide variety of toppings. Their yogurt flavors are awesome too :) Users/ViviS

20110227 22:02:19 nbsp With all the frozen yogurt craziness in Davis, I have to say this place is my favorite. People are constantly hanging out outside, chillin on the benches and enjoying the yogurt, it has a great atmosphere. The process of getting yogurt is entirely self serve as well, the only thing the staff do here as far a customer can tell is restock the goodies and weigh your creation when youre done. They also have these buy x get one free cards which are great, you can make one hell of a monster when youre eligible for your free one. They change their yogurt out once in a while with some new flavors that have been consistently good. Go yolo berry! Users/IanBurau

20110330 20:13:17 nbsp I cant have another frozen/yogurt or icecream. It has to be from Yolo Berry. Im addicted to it! Users/eipp

20110404 00:08:30 nbsp YoloBerry, while not my favourite yoghurt place, is quite yummy. I like their choice of candy toppings especially (while less healthy, its a delicious addition you cant always find at other placesbrownies, Resses, etc).
The downside here is that it is a smaller location, to you most likely have to sit outside, and the frat houses are not the best view. During the day I think this is a great location, convenient to go to, and Id recommend it.  Users/Morganna

20110407 17:55:11 nbsp I was a yogurtshack guy when I came to Davis. But sadly YogurtShack is now gone. But Yoloberry is a very good replacement. :) Plus they give out free yogurt coupons from time to time. Which is awesome! Users/Dozer

20110514 16:41:44 nbsp Ive been here twice and i wont go back. This place is always messy. Yogurt and toppings everywhere. And the lids for the warm toppings are always open, which is a health code violation. Lids are there for a reason. Keep them closed. Users/rachealgalante

20110723 22:28:37 nbsp Best place in Davis to get froyo!!! The usually have an amazing selection of yogurts and toppings, and its all so good! Users/LauraSaldana

20111010 19:58:50 nbsp Great place. Not so many flavors, but an amazing selection of toppings! Users/ParalegalAlien

20111111 20:28:20 nbsp i like yogurt Users/JackSwagger

20140415 22:12:59 nbsp Cheap, delicious, and in a convenient spot! I would recommend this to everyone!!!!!!! Users/YoungResident
