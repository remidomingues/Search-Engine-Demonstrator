20110718 10:03:09 nbsp Yolo Community Care Continuum (YCCC) has been providing community based mental health support services for thirty years. The organization was founded in 1979 when a small group of concerned parents gathered to resolve a dilemma they shared. Each of the parents had young adult children who had been diagnosed with mental illnesses too severe to be cared for at home. They believed it would be beneficial to their children if they could live close by, in a community setting, while receiving the professional support necessary to avoid institutionalization. These parents decided to create a place that felt like home, where their children could get the professional treatment and compassionate support they needed to live as productive lives as possible. One couple donated a house and Yolo Community Care Continuum was born. Their vision has become a statewide model of mental health care.
Our agency serves over 500 adult clients annually through our residential and outpatient programs.  We accept clients from Sacramento County, SutterYuba County, Placer County and other locations throughout Northern California. Safe Harbor Crisis House serves adults experiencing an acute phase of mental illness. This short term residential program provides psychiatric and social services in a compassionate homelike environment. Clients get the medical and psychiatric care, counseling and advocacy services necessary to stabilize their conditions. They learn to manage their illness in order to return to their homes in the community. Safe Harbor serves as an alternative to and as a stepdown from psychiatric hospitalization. Within Yolo County, it is the only alternative to hospitalization.
