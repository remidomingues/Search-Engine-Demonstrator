Yolo Compassionate Friends is a local chapter of The Compassionate Friends.  It is made up of parents who have children that have died.  It also includes support for siblings and grandparents.

The chapter is currently seeking new leadership, and is inactive.  It used to  meet monthly at the conference room of Yolo Hospice on the third Wednesday of each month.

At Compassionate Friends meetings, people have a chance to share experiences, exchange stories, and provide support to other.  Sometimes they have a speaker; other times they discuss a common issue.  There are events shared with thousands other people around the nation and world including their annual candle lighting in December. They do not have outside professional leadership.  Each of them has a common experience.  They are available to provide support to people who have immediate needs.

Contact information for nearby TCF chapters is listed above.  Additional information about other grief resources and The Compassionate Friends national organization may be found on the Yolo Compassionate Friends website.
