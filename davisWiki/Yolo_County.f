Yolo County is one of the original 27 counties created when California became a state in 1850; it has been suggested that the name Yolo is derived from the word yoloy, a Patwin word signifying a place filled with wiki:wikipedia:Juncus rushes. Yolo County is primarily composed of the four cities of Front Page Davis, Woodland, West Sacramento and Winters.  Other locations of note include Esparto and the Capay Valley.  Other than these cities, most of the land is used for agriculture.  Davis rests in the southwestern edge of Yolo on its border with Solano County.  According to the countys web site, Yolo County is the 3rd largest producer of processing tomatoes in California.Footnote(Yolo Countys Star Crop  Processing Tomatoes, Yolo County web site http://www.yolocounty.org/Index.aspx?page1927)  Processing tomatoes are used in processed tomato products like sauces, pastes and ketchup; California produces 99% of all processing tomatoes consumed in the United States.

Woodland is the county seat, although it was originally Washington (later called Broderick, which in turn was absorbed into West Sacramento).
