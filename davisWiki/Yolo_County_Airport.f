20071214 15:38:26 nbsp I saw the preview for the Mythbusters episode and recognized from the brief glimpse I saw the PAC750XL as an aircraft I saw just recently at KEDU being repaired. I thought to myself, I wonder if Mythbusters filmed their skydiving episode around here? I missed the episode because I was on a date. Im going to have to, ahem, find it somewhere....
