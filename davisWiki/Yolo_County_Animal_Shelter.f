The Yolo County Animal Shelter is run by the Animal Services unit of Yolo County Sheriffs Department. It is not the same as the Yolo County SPCA  the SPCA is a privatelyrun organization that also serves animals in Yolo County.  The shelter primarily takes in Dogs dogs and Cats cats; the shelter also provides pet adoptions, redemptions, rescues, and licensing. They investigate noise complaints, inspect kennels, pick up loose animals including livestock, respond to animal attacks, rent Town Wildlife traps, and provide animal welfare checks  some of these services may require a fee. If your pet has died, you can bring it to the shelter (or to your local veterinarian for aftercare), however the Deceased Animal Deposit no longer exists. You can come to the office and let them know, and they will assist you.

It is easy to adopt an animal from the shelter. The adoption process includes a brief interview about your home environment, including questions about previous pet ownership, yard containment, etc.  If you live in a rental property, you must provide proof that your landlord will allow you to keep pets, which an Animal Services officer will verify.  All shelter animals are spayed or neutered before going to their new homes.

All animals over the age of four months must be licensed and vaccinated for rabies. Once your pet is vaccinated, your veterinarian will report this information to Animal Services, initiating you in the licensing system. The shelter will mail or fax you a license application renewable annually or you can complete the application in person at either the shelter or Davis Police Department Davis PD. Proof of a current rabies vaccination is required for all dog licenses. Licensing fees for altered cats and dogs is $15, while unaltered licensing fees are $25.

The Animal Shelter offers low cost rabies clinics on a regular basis (and low cost vaccinations are also available through privately run mobile vaccine clinics and veterinary clinics in Yolo County).  The cost of the rabies vaccination is $8.00.  Please call the office for an appointment. (5306685287)

If your pet has been impounded at the shelter, you need to show a photo ID, proof of ownership (such as a picture of your pet) and proof of current vaccinations plus spay/neuter status. You will also have to pay fees (redemption, boarding, vaccination, license, etc.) before they will release your pet. Some Wiki animals have spent time at the Yolo County Animal Shelter.

The shelter also has a volunteer program which includes providing foster homes, cat socialization, grooming, and dog walking. Also, if you have blankets, towels, pet medications or other animal items, please consider donating them to the shelter. They also can always use liquid laundry detergent! If you are interested in volunteering contact Mailto(ycasrescue@hotmail.com), for more information.

Remember, the SPCA and the Shelter are not the same. The Yolo County Animal Shelter is a division of the Sheriffs Department. It runs the shelter and you can adopt directly from them with no go between. The SPCA is a volunteer organization that works to help place homeless animals and has their own rules and procedures for placing animals.


Is anyone else appalled that Yolo County has a kill shelter? I mean, kill shelters are horrible and inhumane, and Yolo County of all places should eliminate this disgusting practice.  Users/EliseKane
 Why Yolo more than anywhere else?  Lets face it, there arent enough people adopting to keep nokill shelters in the black without massive private donations.   Users/AllisonEriksen

 Are you kidding me? Where are they going to put the dozens of animals that come in each day? Who is going to pay for a huge sanctuary for animals that cannot be adopted? I have a brilliant idea  you want to stop the killing? Donate all your spare cash to the shelter. And all your friends too. And all of Yolo County. Life aint no fairy tale and nationwide 6070% of all animals dropped off at shelters are put to sleep. But dont you dare criticize the shelter workers for dedicating their lives to animals that no one else will take responsibility for.   Users/dizzyditz

20061009 16:19:51 nbsp The Yolo County SPCA, despite how much I hate them, gets a dozen kittens A DAY. Theres just too many. It sucks, but thats life. Users/SandyKnowles

20061009 16:23:18 nbsp So I really just gotta put in my two cents about the Yolo County SPCA. I adopted (more like bought, since they charge a gajillion dollars to adopt) my cat, Fizzle, from the Yolo County SPCA in 2003. Well, she was a stray and when I adopted her she was less than 2 pounds and had a minor upper respiratory infection. The girl who answered my questions and took me through the adoption bureacracy told me about the infection, and Im not an idiot, so I wasnt concerned. They did, however, INSIST on spaying her before I could take her home. Lets recap here: shes barely 6  8 weeks old, shes less than 2 lbs (underweight), and she has an upper respiratory infection. WHAT IDIOT OPERATES ON A SICK ANIMAL?! But they did, and it nearly killed her. It cost me about $500 dollars in vet bills from postop opportunistic infections before she was well again. Therefore, I have no respect for the shelter.  Users/SandyKnowles

20061230 20:28:58 nbsp I think that its REALLY important to point out two things: 1) The animal shelter in Woodland IS NOT run by the SPCA...it is run by Yolo County. The Yolo County SPCA is a totally SEPARATE nonprofit group that simply assists in the adoption process at the shelter. They RESCUE the animals that are in need of removal from the shelter to SAVE them from being euthanized.  The animals are then placed with families throughout the county as fosters until a good home is found for them and they can be adopted.  2)It is not the SPCA nor the Countys fault that you had to have your animal spayed or neutered prior to adoption.  IT IS THE LAW THAT ALL ANIMALS BE SPAYED OR NEUTERED or they cannot be adopted out.  It is to protect the animals from overpopulation and crowding the shelter.  Otherwise its pure irresponsibility on our part.   Users/DarcyMcNie


20070317 14:38:43 nbsp I adopted a cat from the SPCA (not the shelter) and I was told that the cat would become antisocial.  My friend petsat him at her home and she said he was the most affectionate cat and was out roaming around all the time (for 1 yr and 8 months). We realized that the cat wasnt antisocial, instead he just didnt like my dogs.  In fact, he constantly sprayed in areas that my dogs like to sleep in (my clothes, bed, etc).  We realized we couldnt force him to be happy so he needed a home with no dogs so we took him back to the spca.  The people at the spca were so rude.  First, they DEMANDED a monetary donation which defeats the whole point of calling it a donation.  They said that after 2 years, you have to make a donation which is bull b/c the contract we signed never stated so.  So not only did we pay $90 for a cat that we had to take back to the spca, but they wanted additional money because we took care of the cat for 2 years?  It does not make sense to me at all. Users/TiffanyLee

20070317 14:44:20 nbsp They threatened us and told us that we couldnt adopt from spca again.  They made it sound like we abused the cat, tossed him in the trash and kicked him around for a bit.  We were responsible owners who saw our cat in distress and made a hard but thoughtful decision to give the cat back so he can find a home where he will be Happy! They literally just pust us on a list with a bunch of animal killers and abusers! They seemed like they expected us to keep the cat in an environment where he was miserable! isnt the point of the spca to encourage people to adopt and not buy from breeders or pet stores???  Their rudeness literally DRIVES people towards pet stores!   Users/TiffanyLee

20070317 17:42:20 nbsp I adopted a 4 month old puppy from the Animal Shelter today. It cost me $15.00 for the adoption fee, $9.50 for the license, and $18.50 for the first round of vaccinations for a grand total of $48.00.  I am also paying for the dog to be neutered which is $60 to a vet in Davis.  So the grand total of the adoption will be $108.00.  I think this is a reasonable cost since I would have to pay for vaccinations and neutering with any puppy.  I see that the only real cost of the adoption from the Yolo County Shelter was the $15.00 adoption fee.   Users/SharlaDaly

20070317 22:28:53 nbsp We adopted squeaks from here last April. It cost $90 and she was spayed and had been given her first shots, and had been given antibiotics when she first came in. We got a free vet visit as well to make sure she was all right and to establish us with a vet. We got Boo from a family in Vacaville for free and had to pay $300 in vets visits for her shots and to get her spayed. I think its a much better deal to go through the shelter and pay a little bit of money up front than to get a free animal and pay tons in vet visits. Plus, they were fine with me coming in several times before adopting and spending time with the cats before we were ready to adopt.  Users/ElleWeber

20080609 12:20:40 nbsp Our last three dogs came from the SPCA, and all three were/are fantastic dogs that I would never part from.  Yes, adoption prices have gone up, but everyone has a bottom line. I couldnt imagine any of our dogs being put down because of overcrowding. Weve never purchased an animal from a pet store, and never will. Users/jazzybatgirl

20090217 15:51:09 nbsp Unfortunately, there are just too many stray animals taken to the shelter that they can all be adopted; its a terrible shame, but I do understand the necessity to euthanize as a last resort.  Because I  knew this, after my cat died in 2007, I made a point of adopting two cats from the shelter.  They cost about $100 each in total.  They were spayed/neutered, had their shots and a clean bill of health, and the shelter gave us a bag of food for each cat as well as the free vet visit.  An SPCA representative also interviewed me and went over a questionnaire Id filled out about pet ownership before the adoption was approved.  I found out later from another visitor that hed wanted to adopt one of the cats I adopted, but they wouldnt allow it because he intended for the cat to be kept outdoors at all times.  Im glad that they do screen prospective owners this way, in order to provide the best chance possible for the animals.  Needless to say...my two adorable kitties are one of the bright spots in my life, and theyll have a home with me and my family all their lives.  Users/amay

20090511 22:42:17 nbsp I currently work for Yolo County Animal Services, and I have been there 2 years this June 2009. After reading all the posts on this place, I feel the need to update to currrent. Yes, this is a shelter that uses euthansia, however, we try ou ABSOLUTE best to place the animal elsewhere before coming to this final decision. We will find a foster home, a rescue, etc before coming to the last straw. The procedure is completely humane, it only takes a matter of seconds and is not at all painful. A simple injection and the animal simply falls into a peaceful sleep. It is definatley something we all wish we didnt have to do, but if there were more responsible pet owners out there, we wouldnt have to do any of that.

As far as the sick cat insisted on being spayed before it was well, I have never heard of that issue, although I dont doubt it. Since I have started working here and fostering kittens myself, I know they have to be at least 1.5 to 2.0 lbs before any such operation can occur. The cat has to be completely healthy, and adoptable.

I absolutely love working here, and taking care of the animals. I like to make sure eachone is comfortable, and let them know I love them. Because I do. All those poor animals looking sadly at me as I walk by their kennel, needs to know someone loves them, and as I rotate them from their kennels, I make sure I pet each one and make it happy and have it wag its tail. Its a happy feeling for me!

20090512 13:21:23 nbsp I adopted a beautiful dog there 17 years ago. A great experience the staff was very helpful. There were a few people wanting to adopt her, but we were the lucky family. Sadly we had to say goodbye to her a week ago. Mahina was an amazing dog and will be missed.  Users/agerould

20111108 22:41:02 nbsp for folks wanting to really understand that there ARE enough homes for ALL the animals in shelters as noted by numerous studies done by the HSUS and maddies fund. Yolo co animal control receives about 6,000 animals a year total. Stray animals, lost animals, dead animals, and those truly without homes or dropped off by owners no longer wanting/able to care for their pets. So when Elise Kane says of all places Yolo county should be no kill she is correct. This is a low volume animal shelter, there are lots of missing programs being offered to the public. WE should be ashamed that we as a community are not doing something that many many places have achieved with many more animals a year and much less money.  here visit this link if you want more info. and do some research yourself and you can see that OPEN DOOR shelters across the country have achieved no kill. Yes, animals are still euthanized... the animals so ill that they are not treatable and are suffering, and animals that are a danger or risk to the public.However NO animal is euthanized that is healthy and adoptable.   http://www.rescue50.org/politicaladvocacy.html  Users/CayceWallace
