The Yolo County Archives is a publiclyowned collection of historic local and regional documents that consists of maps, blueprints, photographs, bound volumes, manuscripts and oral history tapes from 1850 to the present. Many of these documents were created by Yolo County agencies and departments, while others came from businesses and private citizens.

Some examples of their holdings include property and tax records, court documents, development plans, Board of Supervisors records, photograph collections, church and cemetery records, and over 25,000 obituaries in alphabetical order.

The archives are open to the public on certain days of the week, currently Tuesdays from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and Thursdays from 12 p.m. to 4 p.m. Appointments are required and can be made by calling in advance.

Additionally, the archives are open on selected Saturdays during the summer from 9 a.m. to noon. Appointments are required for these days as well. In 2009, the open Saturdays are May 30, June 27, July 25, and August 29.

For the protection of the valuable resources in the archives, visitors are asked to leave food, drink and pens behind.
