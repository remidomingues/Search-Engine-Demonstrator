The central landfills landfill for the county is located off on County Road 28H off of County Road 102 (or Pole Line Rd. inside Davis) just north of the city limits (http://www.yolocounty.org/Index.aspx?page443 map). Aside from taking the trash from Davis Waste Removal, it offers a variety of recycling and hazardous waste services as well. The landfill is owned and managed by Yolo County but it has no formal agreements with any of the cities it serves, though the Yolo County Board of Supervisors is looking to change this. The county itself only contributes 8% of total waste tonnage while Woodland contributes 32%, West Sacramento 24%, and Davis 22%.Footnote(Sherwin, Elisabeth. http://www.davisenterprise.com/articles/2006/08/07/news/146new2.txt County eyes best ways to dispose of areas waste. The Davis Enterprise. 20060807)

Drugs (prescription and nonprescription drugs, steroids and reproductive hormones) should not be thrown in the garbage, or flushed down the toilet for that matter.  Instead, they may be brought to El Macero Pharmacy, which has a Dont Rush to Flush bin for proper disposal (see story http://www.davisenterprise.com/localnews/dontrushtoflushprogramtohelpkeepwaterwaysclean/ here).


 Hazardous Waste DropOff Days 
Every Friday and Saturday (starting in Oct 2010), Yolo County offers free household hazardous waste disposal at the central landfill between 7:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. Automotive fluids, fluorescent lights, paint, pool chemicals, and other materials you should not be throwing in the trash or dumping down the Waste Water Treatment Plant drain are accepted up to a certain amount (125 pounds or 15 gallons) as long as you are a County resident. http://www.yolocounty.org/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid2767 and http://www.yolocounty.org/Index.aspx?page437 have dates and other important information. Volunteer opportunities are available.

 Recycling Services 
The landfill will also accept certain materials for recycling, including the usual paper/plastic/aluminum that the local trash pickup handles. They will also take electronics, in particular CRT televisions and CRT computer monitors which contain large amounts of lead and other toxic chemicals. This is a free service available every day the landfill is open.  Check the website as the items recycled is always expanding (more electrical and electronic items were recently added to the recycling, so bring that dead vacuum).

 Bioreactor 
This is also the site of one of the EPAs http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/nonhw/muncpl/landfill/bioreactors.htm Project XL bioreactor projects. The Yolo landfill started with two 10,000 ton demonstration plots in 1993 has has since scaled up to two 100,000 ton cells. They work by circulating liquid throughout the solid waste, considerably speeding up decomposition and allowing for greater utilization of landfill space. Yolo uses an anaerobic bioreactor, which forces decomposition in the absence of oxygen and releases large amounts of methane gas that can be captured and used for energy generation.  The current set up can generate approximately 3 Mwatts which is sold to Southern California Edison.  The current power generation set up makes money for the county, which is used to keep the fees for dumping at the landfill as low as possible (so people dump there and not on the side of the road).

Alternative
Some materials can be taken to Woodland Biomass instead.
You can also Recycle.

Plastic Bags, Cardboard and Paper products at the Landfill
Plastic bags, cardboard and paper products are a nuisance at the landfill, blowing around in the wind and causing staff to set up trash fences and collect them from around the area. According to Ramin Yazdani, an employee at the landfill, plastic bags are a nuisance at the landfill, blowing around in the wind and causing staff to set up trash fences and collect them from around the area. He took the following photos to highlight the impact of plastic bags and the efforts they employ at the landfill to minimize their escape into the surrounding environment. The photos were submitted to the City Council on his behalf a movement to ban plastic bags in Davis.



20060929 18:55:59 nbsp The Yolo County Landfill only accepts cash or checks as payment, according to their website. What they did not mention, which I found out today, is that they do not accept starter checks, the checks must have the name and other info printed on them. Dont switch your bank account and then go to the dump. A lot of trouble for a $12 fee. Users/KarlMogel

20061226 16:53:21 nbsp Ugh, I had to take something to the dump since they wouldnt pick it up in Davis. Dont do it unless you have to. Davis Waste Managment has all these awkward items days, the dump was gross, and I had to get out on this mountain of trash. It was slippery, stinky and Im not really a total priss, I just didnt want to fall into the foul smelling mountain o trash/mud.  Users/AmyGoogenspa

20070306 09:03:40 nbsp Just a quick thought on AmyGs comment...Those hills that encompass the Landfill are infact, giant piles of the garbage you throw away, every day.  Please reduce, reuse, and recycle as much as you can. Users/RocksandDirt  Full Disclosure  I work for the landfill Users/Rocksanddirt

              Your point is moot considering that her trash is a very small portion of that whole entire landfill, much less even a smaller portion of that mountain of trash. You cannot recycle everything either, so we would still need landfills, even if we recycled everything that we could.

20090323 12:42:45 nbsp Update to Karls comment....the scalehouse now takes visa, mc, and discover cards.   Users/RocksandDirt

20090723 14:56:12 nbsp They take computer components free of charge (Thats why theres an $8 recycling fee when you purchase a new laptop or monitor or flatscreen TV.
A kinda response to Karl: Also, dont pay in change.  They dont like that. I paid in... I think it was rolls of dimes and they had me wait while they opened the rolls to count the change.   Users/MasonMurray

20110310 14:08:34 nbsp Lets see... Not only do Plastic Bags make up less than .4% of the total waste in California landfills, most of them, if not all, are also now made of vegetable base and not petroleum, making them biodegradeable...And we want to spend 350,000.00 here in Davis alone to ban them...

Why not actually ban something useful like Computer parts, TVs... things that are actually nonbiodegradable and take up huge amounts of space in the landfills.. Even better, lets start small and ban something that is extremely terrible for the environment and not biofriendly in anyway... Styrofoam containers!  Sick of people complaining about the plastic bags... I reuse mine, if others dont, I dont care...  Its not worth 350,000.00 of taxpayer money to ban them. Users/WesP
  Just because it is made of vegetable base DOES NOT mean it is biodegradable. Conversely, just because a plastic is made from petroleum doesnt men it is NOT biodegradable.  Bioplastics can last millenia when covered by dirt.

20110311 10:50:16 nbsp Wes, I think you might be misinformed. Film plastics make up over 4% of what goes to landfill by WEIGHT: 890 TONS/year from DAVIS RESIDENTS alone (http://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/WasteChar/rescomp.asp?J521&SortByDisposal). Most film plastic comes in the form of bags and shrink wrap. Few have any biobased content and many are misleadingly labeled degradable meaning they have chemical softeners added to get them to break into smaller pieces as they persist in the environment. Also, I dont know where you got the $350,000 cost to the city to ban bags. This is not real there are no such costs associated with the program unless we went ahead and did an expensive EIR to prove the bags have impacts. There is already sufficient data out there as many EIRs have been performed at this point. If you reuse your plastic bags then you shouldnt be affected by the ban because youll just keep reusing them, right? Or are they really not that reusable after all and will end up as pollution?

20110420 17:44:45 nbsp The 4% referenced in the above comment from the study (http://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/WasteChar/rescomp.asp?J521&SortByDisposal) refers to ALL film plastic, not just plastic bags. This includes film plastic used in the ag industry, syranwrap, ziplock bags, etc. More than just grocery bags. A more recent study (http://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/Publications/General/2009023.pdf) done in 2008 shows that plastic grocery and other merchandise bags alone make up only 0.3% of Californinas overall waste, and only 0.6% of the residentail waste stream. Not really worth the effort. Users/SophiePotter
