20070330 09:37:46 nbsp I contacted Freddie to get an electronic version of the precint map for Davis.  She told me they only had the little lowres version on their website.  I find that hard to believe, but possible. Users/DavidGrundler
 Somebody, somewhere, probably has it in Arcview. I cant find it on their website now either. In any case it can change depending on if city issues are being voted on, so if you want something current you probably need to wait until the next election is near when they will publish it, on paper at least.
