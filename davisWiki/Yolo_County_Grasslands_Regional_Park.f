Yolo County Grasslands Regional Park is just one of many parks in the Davis area. This 320 acre park was acquired from the federal government with the agreement that it be used for public recreation. In 1990, the government expressed concern that the county had not yet made any improvements or otherwise utilized or public recreation. On December 2, 2003, the City of Davis pledged to provide funding support for improvements outlined in the proposed http://www.yolocounty.org/prm/grasslandspark.htm Interim Management Plan that include the Dogs dog park and family picnic access areas. Friends of Canines at Grasslands Regional Park have also pledged support for dog park improvement costs and maintenance, and Tree Davis has accepted responsibility for weed management within protected oak woodlands. The City of Davis has restricted public access to 63 acres as burrowing owl habitat 33 acres for Mace Ranch habitat mitigation banking plus an additional 30acre easement with additional acreage restricted by oak woodlands preservation and vernal pools. In exchange for this habitat mitigation, they pledged in 2003 to provide parity for the estimated loss of land value by providing $45,000$50,000 for a 35 acre Bark Park at the southwest corner of park; included in this pledge was provision for perimeter chain link fencing, entrance gates, a tenvehicle parking lot and water access.

Currently 2006, the only other public uses of the remaining area are archery and http://www.svss.org/ model airplane use. In winter, raptors are abundant while in spring, unique Little Brown Birds passerines may be found utilizing this oasis of trees among the fields.
