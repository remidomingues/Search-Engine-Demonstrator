The health department is responsible for protecting and improving the health of residents of Yolo County and assuring that quality health services are available and accessible.

Public health differs from medical health services by looking at the entire population, preventing diseases, and improving the health of the community.  Medical health services focus on the individual and diagnosing and treating disease.  Since 1900, the average life expectancy for Americans has increased by about 30 years.  Over 25 of the 30 years can be atributed to public health initiatives, while medical advances account for less than four years.

Public Health Services for Yolo County include:

 Detection and prevention of communicable diseases
 Health Education, with emphasis on tobacco education and prevention, HIV and Hepatitis C education, counseling and testing, nutrition and physical activity, vehicle passenger safety, and lead poisoning prevention
 Immunizations
 Birth and Death records
 Support and monitoring of services for vulnerable populations, families with children, senior citizens, and other special health needs
 Rabies case investigation and control measures

Click the link above to see health violations of Davis and Davis area restaurants.  Keep in mind that most restaurants that are perfectly safe get a few citations each time around.  If the inspector thought there were any danger posed to public health, theyd shut the place down until the problems were fixed.  They just started putting the reports online, so most dont have any inspection up yet.  Normal, clean restaurants and facilities like http://www.decadeonline.com/insp.phtml?agencyYOL&violsortfieldTB_CORE_INSPECTION_VIOL.UPDATE_BY&forceresults1&record_idPR0025780 Nugget, http://www.decadeonline.com/insp.phtml?agencyYOL&violsortfieldTB_CORE_INSPECTION_VIOL.UPDATE_BY&forceresults1&record_idPR0023094 Posh Bagel and http://www.decadeonline.com/insp.phtml?agencyYOL&violsortfieldTB_CORE_INSPECTION_VIOL.UPDATE_BY&forceresults1&record_idPR0021865 Subway all have several violations, some critical (which just mean they have to be corrected for a follow up inspection).  Dont be horrified if your favorite restaurant has several violations... it does not mean it is terribly unclean.  Keep in mind the examples listed are just examples, not actual things found at that facility.  Violations highlight areas of improvement, not indicate that it is dangerous to eat there.  Places that are actually dangerous get closed down until they comply.

If youre more squeamish than curious, you might not want to go through the list.  Your kitchen is likelier more dangerous (Do you have unbreakable, enclosed light covers on every light source?  Have you ever seen a bug, dead or alive, in your house or apartment?  Do you mark the time you remove something from a fridge?  Do you have a separate sink used only for washing hands?), but youre also not serving food to large numbers of people every day.  If you have no problem going through a farm and then sitting down to a meal, or like to go camping or picnicing and pick the occasional bug out of your food, youre probably okay.

If you have an idealistic view of your food, and you honestly think that shrink wrapped bag of chips came from a pristine source, rather than a bunch of dirt covered, industrially washed potatoes, or your orange juice box is anything other than oranges that were bruised, spotted or otherwise not pleasing enough to sell individually, it might be a good idea to not read these reports and maintain your illusion that food is a sterile product with no origin or preparation.

In the end, the fact that the restaurant is open indicates that they were found to be safe.
