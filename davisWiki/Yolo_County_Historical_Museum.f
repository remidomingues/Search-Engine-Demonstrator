A Museums and Exhibits museum that has artifacts from the history of Yolo County. Admission is $2 for adults, but free for children under 12 and museum members.

Massive wooden columns , formal pediment and a uniquely original series of cut decorations spelling the name Gibson reflect some of the character of the ten room house that is now the Yolo County Historical Museum. This 1850s70s Classical Revival home, extensively remodeled before the turn of the century, was built by William Byas Gibson and occupied by his family until 1963. It now houses rooms of furnishings depicting different styles and eras. Acquired by the County of Yolo and opened to the public on a regular basis, the house and grounds are here for your pleasure.

The Museum houses collections of furnishings and artifacts depicting the various eras from the 1850s to the 1930s. In addition to being a house museum there are changing exhibits on various subjects related to the history of Yolo County. The outbuildings contain displays of agriculture and everyday life of the same period. Feel free to visit us anytime during public hours.

The grunds are also available for events. http://www.yolo.net/ychm/special.html
