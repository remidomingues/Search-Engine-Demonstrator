The Mary L. Stephens Branch is part of the Yolo County Library system. It used to be known as the Davis Branch Library Davis Branch as the sign in the picture below indicates, but the name was changed in December 2006 to honor the former Yolo County Librarian who served from 19692006. Other book/item returns can be found at Patwin School Patwin Elementary and near the main parking lot at Marguerite Montgomery Elementary School. In 2011, the school library at Montgomery became a small satellite open regularly Saturdays 10 AM to 2:00 PM and Tuesdays 5 PM to 9 PM offering a small browsing collection, internet computers and pickup of materials placed on hold through the catalog.

Because of November 2007 Election/Measure P, the building closed for http://www.yolocounty.org/Index.aspx?page1498 renovation, taking about a year starting in Summer 2009. The library was closed for moving from August 15th to September 8th, according to http://www.yolocounty.org/Index.aspx?page26&recordid873&returnURL%2fIndex.aspx%3fpage%3d189 a press release dated 7/24/09. On Tuesday, September 8, the library opened at an alternate location: 2801 Second Street (Pena and Second, the former DISC arena behind Explorit Science Center) until renovations were completed.

On November 2, 2007 before the passage of the measure, Users/JessicaRockwell interviewed Branch Librarian Users/JayJohnstone on her KDVS show Neoism Neoisms about library services and the measure. This project was covered in the Davis Enterprise on http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_verz39.882004&rft_idinfo:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:DVEB&rft_val_formatinfo:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat1213B3447A283EA0&svc_datInfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat0FCEDEB95BD4D563 June 10, 2008 and http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_verz39.882004&rft_idinfo:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:DVEB&rft_val_formatinfo:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat126F9AF56491C930&svc_datInfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat0FCEDEB95BD4D563 March 15, 2009 (Newsbank).

Some notable changes: The reference desk and circulation desk have been combined and the childrens room has been greatly expanded, Outside, the bike rack area has been moved to the northern end of the parking lot and is lightly sheltered, and two automated checkin stations have been added which allow a patron to return an item and receive a receipt for the return immediately. The number of public computers doubled to 38.  Several new public art pieces and new skylights were added.

Computer and Internet

These are Internet Access computers for Public Internet Terminals public use. There are 38 computers available, in almost constant use. The library has WiFi throughout the building. You can access wifi by sitting outside the library as well. Unfortunately, the wifi connections allow only HTTP  even VPN connections are blocked.  Ethernet jacks are in the meeting rooms meeting room, but the Ethernet jacks require authentication and are for staff use only.
 What exactly does this mean? 802.1x? The last time I tried to get ethernet here, the jacks I tried in the main area were just dead (if memory serves, and this was before the installation of web OPAC), and LUGOD lore says that dhcp is available from the red jack in The Blanchard Community Room but only tcp port 80 and 443 can go out to the internet.

Big Read: Open Access Science 2013 2014
Title: Gulp: Adventures on the Alimentary Canel by Mary Roach
Description:
Americas funniest science writer (Washington Post) takes us down the hatch on an unforgettable tour. The alimentary canal is classic Mary Roach terrain: the questions explored in Gulp are as taboo, in their way, as the cadavers in Stiff and every bit as surreal as the universe of zero gravity explored in Packing for Mars. Why is crunchy food so appealing? Why is it so hard to find words for flavors and smells? Why doesnt the stomach digest itself? How much can you eat before your stomach bursts? Can constipation kill you? Did it kill Elvis? In Gulp we meet scientists who tackle the questions no one else thinks ofor has the courage to ask. We go on location to a petfood tastetest lab, a fecal transplant, and into a live stomach to observe the fate of a meal. With Roach at our side, we travel the world, meeting murderers and mad scientists, Eskimos and exorcists (who have occasionally administered holy water rectally), rabbis and terroristswho, it turns out, for practical reasons do not conceal bombs in their digestive tracts. Like all of Roachs books, Gulp is as much about human beings as it is about human bodies.

Best Time to Visit
Weekdays before 2PM and after 6PM are the best times to go to check out a book or just browse. After 1:302:00PM weekdays, students from the Davis Joint Unified School District local schools come in and usually fill the available tables/study space.

Reserving Materials Online
The Yolo County library system has a pretty good selection of books, movies, and more. However it is spread across several branches, and popular books and DVDs other than Richard Simmons Workout are generally snatched up quickly. If there is a particular book, movie, or other media that you desire (including items currently located at other branches) and you have a library card and PIN, you can look it up and reserve it from home through the http://webiii.yolocounty.org/ online catalog. You will be emailed when the item is available, and can then pick it up from the hold shelves. This is also good for busy people  reserve your items ahead of time, and you can be in and out in five minutes, with no searching.

Parking
Parking is usually not a problem, but because it is a Davis city lot, the lot can fill up at certain times and days of the week. This is true for weekdays around 2:303:00PM, when tons of parents commandeer the lot, waiting to pick up their little darlings from North Davis School North Davis. The same parents will overrun the lot on Saturday mornings, when they come to watch the same little darlings participate in soccer. This has occasionally led to frustrated library patrons complaining to library staff, who cant do anything about it because its a Davis city lot. Bicycling to the library is a very practical and effective solution because of the library and Community Parks great Bike Paths bike path connections to the North Star Greenbelt and other bike routes.

Book Sale
Every two months, the Friends of the Davis Public Library will hold book sales at the library. These are good for picking up some fiction or nonfiction on the cheap, and are usually in the J. Richard Blanchard Room (named after a longtime friend of the library who worked at Shields Library).  Members of the Friends of the Davis Library Friends get first dibs the first couple hours of the sale, before it is opened to the public, though one could always join at the door. The Friends of the Davis Library Friends also maintain a book/magazine nook just inside the library entrance a good opportunity to pick up older magazines or cheap beach books for mere change. The funds are used by the Friends of the Library to enhance the services and collections of the library.

Bronze Plaques Outside

Take some time to wander the sidewalk between the library and its parking lot. Embedded in the concrete are bronze Yolo County Library  Davis Branch/Plaques plaques with amoebic edges, one of the Public Art projects installed at the site. (Others are the etchings on the glass of the doors and windows, and the ceramic installations around the two water fountains.) Each plaque has writing on it using a different writing system from around the world. There was some controversy because the writings are not actual texts  they artistically use the writing systems, rather than using the languages. There are 13 plaques with Egyptian hieroglyphics, Mayan writing, cuneiform, and others, designed to provoke curiosity rather than satisfy it which is purposely left for the appropriate institution, the library, according to Wang Po Shu who created the artwork.

Bike Racks
The covered bike rack area in the lot appears to have less room than was available after the decorative wall was removed from the old structure. There is still room for the Good Places to Take Kids ubiquitous bike/trailer combo, but expect to get wet after parking your Bicycles bike on rainy days. The photovoltaic panels on the roof of the structure are reported to be generating nearly $1,000 monthly credit on the library energy bill, helping to compensate for the plentiful power outlets used by visitors to power their laptops and other digital devices.

Photos of the Temporary Location When It Was At DISC



20090321 16:51:56 nbsp Stay away during lunch time when the high schoolers overrun the library/computers. Dont they have their own lab? Users/EricaMacGregor

20090621 02:28:39 nbsp Im surprised that the renovation went on even with the budget issue. And when asked about whether programs will be continued (storytelling for the kids, etc), they said theyre not sure? So which one is more importantbrand new renovations or services?  Users/val
  As someone who uses the library regularly, Id have to vote for the renovations. Actually, I did http://www.yolocounty.org/Index.aspx?page1498 vote for them : ) .  The linked measure was to authorize a tax with a specific purpose: keeping the librarys hours, additional staffing and funding the building update. Id asked the childrens librarian about the temporary location, got an answer, but have since forgotten (something makes me think that itll be near Explorit on 2nd St.Ill update this if I remember for sure or after I ask again). She had also said that shes going to try to continue w/ the storytimes and programs, but they need to find a suitable venue.Users/KevinChin

Childrens programming continues at the temporary site (2801 Second Street, corner of Pena and 2nd in the same building as Explorit). The storytimes for youngsters are conducted in the childrens section of the library, are wellattended, and seem to be appreciated by other library users even when it gets noisy. Its a joyous sound. (Jay Johnstone)

20090621 15:18:57 nbsp Theyre http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iwsearch/we/InfoWeb?p_productAWNB&p_themeaggregated5&p_actiondoc&p_docid128BF73B27C0E528&p_docnum4&p_queryname1 moving to DISC. Renovations is great, just wanted to be sure that theyd be able to continue their excellent programs and be able to still host community groups there, and not just upgrading the infrastructure.. Users/val

20090807 18:38:41 nbsp I used to support the Friends of the Library booksale, but lately have seen some price increase thats hard to swallow  e.g., the http://eventful.com/sacramento/events/friendsbellecooledgelibrarybooksale/E00010229174840 Belle Cooledge Library booksale (dates overlap with current booksale at Davis) sells their adults books at 50 cents (hardcover) and 25 cents (softcover), while the Davis FOL sell theirs at 2 dollar each? Thats 4 times what they sell in Sacramento, people. Can anyone give me a reason for this? Even the SPCA thrift store sell their adults used book at 1 dollar I think, and all the kids books there are 25 cents vs. 50 cents to a dollar at the Davis library sale. Users/val

20091104 14:04:16 nbsp There is now a Pepsi vending machine near the bathrooms at the temporary location.  Not sure if this is for raising extra revenue for the library or not. Users/ZachStednick

The Pepsi machine vends water and tea drinks besides sodas. Having it at the library is experimental, to see how much demand there is for this convenience, and whether or not spillage is a problem. The renovation includes an area designated for snacks and beverages and may contain a vending machine also. The revenue is a small secondary benefit compared to the convenience for staff and visitors. (Jay Johnstone, Branch Manager)
    Made me blink a second when I saw it; thinking I was in the lobby of an offStrip Vegas motel. Users/DickLiddle
    Good one, Dick! Cant wait to see the improvements back at the Branch. The suspense will be intense since there will be no library open at all in Davis after the temp. location closes Oct. 4 till Dec. 7. Users/BrianOrr

20100914 17:16:32 nbsp So will they bring back the teen center that was located here originally since the only other center for them was taken over by the Bicycling Hall of Fame? Users/WesP
  Its back and it has graphic novels too! Users/ObviouslyAnonymousUser62

20110126 10:03:13 nbsp Was I correct in seeing a flyer that says theres Mandarin Chinese storytime on Sundays at 3pm?  Users/jsbmeb
   Yes, there is now a free weekly bilingual storytime in Mandarin and English for children ages 5 and under. Check out the official http://www.yolocounty.org/index.aspx?recordid1554&page26 press release for more details.

20120320 11:52:03 nbsp Silence and respect for the space of others are not a priority in this library. It seems as though the needs of those who wish to converse and speak on their cell phones and the needs of children to scream, demand, throw tantrums and run across the hallways are more important than the needs of those who need some silence to read and concentrate. Please step at the entrance of the library and listen to the chartroom atmosphere. One can get more silence at Starbucks, unfortunately. Users/AChaves
 If you really want silence go to the quite area (near the North West) or check out an alcove. Silence is aggressively enforced in the former. Reference librarians will be on it if you inform them... Daubert
 We are sorry to hear that you found it difficult to enjoy the library.  We understand that some people come to the Library in search of a quiet, peaceful environment while others come to the Library for our activities and programs. While these different agendas/activities may sometimes seem to conflict, they are also a reflection of the varied interests and needs of our community. The staff at the Davis Public Library strive to create an environment that provides diverse and engaging opportunities for all people to read, learn and connect. We also strive to give all individuals the same consideration and level of service.  Please let the staff at the Reference Desk know if you feel someone’s behavior is inappropriate for the Library. And please feel free to explore the Hughes Room (as mentioned by Daubert) where we actively maintain a quiet space. You may also take advantages of our study rooms with the first comes first serves policy.  Users/PuiyukSin,  Davis Library Staff
