The mission of the regional task force (YONET) is to significantly diminish the availability and use of illegal drugs in the city and county boundaries designated by each participating agencys involvement and apprehend the responsible offenders, thereby increasing public safety. YONET operates out of the Yolo County District Attorneys office.

While most of YONETs efforts are directed at discovering and erradicating pot farms, meth labs, and drug trafficing and sales, YONET has been known to move in fully armed to break up teenage beer parties in rural and city locations. While Davis Police tend to warn the kids and call their parents to pick them up, YONET officers arrest them.

YONET ideally consists of 2 officers from each department in Yolo County, however the UCD spot has been vacant for several years now, and most departments only have one officer, except the DA has two investigators, and two support staff.


20061024 17:11:06 nbsp YONET raided my friends appt 2 years ago with 2 plainclothed officers on a probation search... They dont play around at all and had their pistols out and aimed the second they identified themselves as law enforcment officers Users/StevenDaubert

20061026 10:39:33 nbsp Yeah, once YONET has you in their sights, they absolutely come in like a SWAT team. They busted my neighbors once and I arrived home to find multiple police vehicles, men in black and all the neighbors lined up against one of the cars that was parked literally feet from their front door. Its frightening how amped up men with guns can become! Users/AlphaDog

20070217 02:31:07 nbsp They set off a flash bang in an apartment in DaVinci Court Apartments Da Vinci in mid 06. It left a gnarly burn on the carpet (it was like 3 foot black patch and the site of detonation was seared thru the carpet to the floor). They broke a window to throw it in, this was before they kicked in the door and then served the warrant. Users/StevenDaubert

20121031 00:40:11 nbsp My experience is that in Davis..as in many other place we have gone way downhill in the area of honesty..beginning at the top w/ the powers that be..bleeding down to every crack and crevice in the county..Im not saying their are no good cops left in Davis..its just the last one i was aware of retired recently..but one thing is for sure..when it comes to YONET and their prey...in my opinion..they are the same psychopath..if anything they let the drugs be....I believe one can just buy a franchise...as its not who you know..but who you blow!! Sorry boyz..to many interpersonal relationships w/ some of these folks...and my family of origin which is wrythe w/ psychopaths...they stick out like sore thumbs to me.....their likes are usually the ones we grew up w/ that got picked on...lied alot to mummy and daddy to have their way..AND IT WORKED..SO THEY KEPT RIGHT ON GOING.One thing about the little weasels though..they are so busy watching everyone else trying to figure out how to cheat or snitch..GET AHEAD ANY WAY THEY CAN..they rarely watch themselves and if you listen carefully or read thier reports..anyone ever read a police report on themselves that was 1/2 fiction..JESUS..polititians!!!#1 psychopath..HELLO!!...Hopefully the grand jury will be coming to a town like this soon..but I doubt it seriousely since if one was following THE PEPPER SPRAY INCIDENT AT UCDAVIS ONE WOULD KNOW THE STATES ATTORNEYS OFFICE WOULD NOT TOUCH IT W/ YOUR DI....DID I SAY THAT....IM AFRAID THE PLACE IS GOING TO POT...
