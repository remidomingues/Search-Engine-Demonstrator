Mission Statement

The American Red Cross prevents and alleviates human suffering in the face of emergencies by mobilizing the power of volunteers and the generosity of donors.

Principles of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Network

  Humanity: The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, born of a desire to bring assistance without discrimination to the    wounded on the battlefield, endeavors, in its international and national capacity, to prevent and alleviate human suffering wherever it may be found. Its purpose is to protect life and health and to ensure respect for the human being. It promotes mutual understanding, friendship, cooperation and lasting peace amongst all peoples.

  Impartiality: It makes no discrimination as to nationality, race, religious beliefs, class or political opinions (but it will based on sexual orientation  they refuse blood from all gay men). It endeavors to relieve the suffering of individuals, being guided solely by their needs, and to give priority to the most urgent cases of distress.

 Neutrality: In order to continue to enjoy the confidence of all, the Movement may not take sides in hostilities or engage at any time in controversies of a political, racial, religious or ideological nature.

  Independence: The Movement is independent. The national societies, while auxiliaries in the humanitarian services of their governments and subject to the laws of their respective countries, must always maintain their autonomy so that they may be able at all times to act in accordance with the principles of the Movement.

  Voluntary service: It is a voluntary Movement not prompted in any manner by desire for gain.

  Unity: There can be only one Red Cross or Red Crescent Society in any one country. It must be open to all. It must carry on its humanitarian work throughout its territory.

  Universality: The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, in which all Societies have equal status and share equal responsibilities and duties in helping each other, is worldwide.

A short History on the ARC and International RC

   Henry Dunant, a Swiss businessman, founded the Red Crescent Network and the International Red Cross. In 1859, during his travels, Dunant witnessed a battle between French and Austrian forces, which left over 40,000 dead and wounded. Seeing the grotesque scene of soldiers lying on the battlefield with no medical assistance made an impression on him. He immediately began to organize a group of locals to provide help for the wounded.
   When Dunant returned to Switzerland he could not forget the horrific scenes he had experienced. He first wrote a novel, A Memory of Solferino (1862), and later began a campaign for wounded soldiers, arguing that the wounded deserved humane treatment no matter which side of the battle they were on. The Geneva Society for Public Welfare helped establish a committee called the International Committee for Relief to the Wounded in Time of War.
   In 1864 the International Conference had representatives of 16 European states attend. This led to the Geneva Convention, a treaty meant to diminish suffering of military personnel and to save lives. The emblem would be the Red Cross (the reverse of the Swiss flag, which sports a red background with a white cross) and would signify protection, equipment and most importantly, neutrality.
   The Geneva Convention led to other laws including the International Humanitarian Law (IHL) as well as the second Geneva Convention, to protect those participating in maritime warfare. Many revisions were added later to include prisoners of war and civilians in the time of war, as well ass civilwar victims.
   Clara Barton, a Civil War nurse, founded the American Red Cross in 1881. By 1900 the ARC revised a charter from Congress under which it still operates. The charter included the organization’s responsibilities and established an executive structure.
   The ARC used to be primarily responsible for the relief of victims in war and natural disasters. However, since WWII, many other organizations have crowded the field such as the UNICEF, WHO, FAO and more. Still, the ARC is a leader in providing services to its communities and societies in need.
