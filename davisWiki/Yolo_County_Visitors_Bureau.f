A location downtown in the Mansion Square where Davis visitors can go to find information about places to stay, places to meet, things to do, and attractions.  They also have a calendar of events.  On their http://www.yolocvb.org/ website you can also find deals on local hotels.  The website is no Front Page wiki, but its pretty nice.  The Bureau has gone countywide and now represents Winters, Woodland and the unincorporated Yolo County County areas.
