Yolo Crisis Nursery, run by FamiliesFirst, aims to prevent child abuse by providing parents with a place to leave their children during times of severe stress. Children age 05 can be voluntarily placed at the Yolo Crisis Nursery by their parents for up to 30 days. They also provide support and resources to help the parents resolve the crisis and cope with stress.

Volunteer Opportunities Volunteers and Recycling and Donation Directory donations are needed! Depending upon the volunteer duties, appropriate screening will take place. Those who provide direct care to children must have child abuse clearance and criminal record clearances. Must be 18 or older.

The YCN is also an excellent place to donate new and used baby and toddler items.
