The YEEP is a program administered by the City of Davis and implemented by the Valley Energy Efficiency Corporation (VEEC) on behalf of Yolo County and the incorporated cities.  YEEP works to encourage energy efficiency in Yolo County by distributing free compact fluorescent light bulbs, providing a $1/square foot rebate on sun screens, and offering significant rebates for lighting improvements for small businesses.  YEEP conducts outreach events throughout the county to provide energy education to encourage savings.
