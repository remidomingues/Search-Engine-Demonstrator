The Yolo Energy Watch (YEW) is a local government partnership between Yolo County, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), and Pacific Gas and Electric Company. YEW is building on the organizational efforts and mission of the Environment Climate Change Compact of Yolo County (Compact) in pursuit of its goals. Funding for YEW comes from California utility ratepayers under the auspices of the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC).

Yolo Energy Watch connects Davis residents with various state programs aiming to improve the energy efficiency of homes. Homeowners and renters can take advantage of a wide variety of programs that can save energy, increase comfort in their home, save money on utility bills, and potentially increase the value of their home.  Incomequalified residents, homeowners or renters, can receive free basic energy efficiency measures for lighting and other home weatherization projects.

For larger projects, Energy Upgrade California offers up to $4,000 in rebates for making energyefficiency improvements to the home. This can be combined with a new CHF Residential Energy Retrofit Program, which is offering 3% financing with no credit check for eligible owners. This allows homeowners financial flexibility when considering home energy improvements.
