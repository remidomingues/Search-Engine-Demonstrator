 
Yolo Fruit Stand is a Fruit and Vegetable Stands little market in the eastern Outskirts outskirts of town on County Road 32b.  You can easily get to it by taking Chiles Road east from Mace Blvd and following it as it turns into County Road 32B, or by turning from the eastbound lane of Interstate 80 I80. Heading west on I80, take the first frontage road after the Yolo Causeway, and make your first right; this road loops around under the freeway and turns into 32b. If youre going by bike, County Road 32a 32a (on the north side of I80) may be a little more pleasant, as there is a Bicycling bike lane most of the way.  If you cant make it there by car, and if you cant bike there, dont fret; they accept mail orders over the phone.

The store sells a variety of very fresh Fruit and Vegetable Stands fruits and vegetables and a selection of other items at very cheap prices. The small grocery isles contain several middle eastern items, dried fruits, olive oil, and fresh baked bread.  For the inquisitive taste buds, they have mint yogurt soda (yes, only for inquisitive taste buds).  In one corner of the store is a small coffee stand selling organic coffee (cups or whole beans).  And as of May 2006, they sell great freshly made fruit smoothies (variously using watermelon, stawberries, and cantaloupe).

The owner/employees are very friendly and quick to give you advice on choosing items you may not be familiar with.  You can find out more about the folks running the place and the challenges inherent in running a roadside produce stand in a http://www.davislifemagazine.com/2010/03/yolofruitstand/ story that follows manager Altim Shquti in Davis Life Magazine.

Yolo Fruit Stand sells a number of flavors of Gunthers ice cream Gunthers ice cream and fruit freezes (try the mango!) in its freezer.

Theyll show up on your credit card record as YOLO FRESH INC.



20050514 22:35:29 nbsp I was sooo going to make this page a couple weeks ago, but I was at work and didnt have the contact info.  I love this place, and hope that people go there so they stay open!  A warning to the curious: the mint yogurt soda is totally disgusting.  Its lumpy and really salty and just totally vile.  My roommate Amanda and I tried it a month ago, and agree that its nasty!  On the bright side, they sell the yummy tortillas that you can get from the Farmers Market here, but theyre cheaper. Users/SummerSong

20050514 23:46:06 nbsp You kinda have to be used to the mint yogurt soda stuff.  Its a really popular cold drink for most of the mideast, especially when fresh in a pitcher.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doogh Doogh Users/EdWins ES

20050515 09:24:44 nbsp The paradoxical thing about the yogurt soda is that youre supposed to shake it to break up the yogurt clumps.  However, as the clerk warned me when I bought it, after you shake it, dont open it when youre in the car! Users/CarlMcCabe Carl (love mint yogurt soda) Users/CarlMcCabe McCabe

20050707 21:05:50 nbsp  This place is great! They have a wide variety of fresh fruits and veggies. Their mangoes and white nectarines are awesome. They also have tons of unique packaged foods, like chocolate covered nuts, yogurt pretzels and dried fruit. This palce is all about bargains and great food. Users/SiennaGrass

20050725 09:46:35 nbsp Bigger than Ikedas, but not as good.  Somehow Ikedas has even managed to squeeze a better selection of food into their smaller space!  The eggs I bought at Yolo Fruit Stand were already going bad.  Wont go there again.  Ikedas is better. Users/MattJurach

20050725 11:36:05 nbsp I have only gotten coffee there, it has been nice.  (it is very convienent for me on the way to work)   Users/RocksandDirt

20060319 13:50:00 nbsp I think Yolo Fruit Stand is better than Ikedass. From my experience, the quality of the produce is great and really cheap.  They used to carry the Le Vert Green Tea drink but I dont know what happened to it. I cant find that drink anywhere.  Users/PattyLouieJunior

20060426 12:07:04 nbsp My opinion is kind of biased since I spent a summer working at this market, but this place is great.  The main attraction is all kinds of produce at supercheap prices, usually cheaper than ikedas and waaaay cheaper than any supermarket.  Things get really cheap in the summer, some of the highlights last summer were:

bellpeppers 5/$1 corn 7/$1 lemons/limes 4/5/$1 etc.

This place is owned and mostly operated by one family and they are very friendly, if you want to try any of the fruit just ask.

They also have fresh juice, every kind of dried fruit and nut you can think of, and a lot of imported foods, (trader joes type stuff), and a full espresso/smoothie bar.

If you find yourself there I would throw down $5 and try the lemonhoney, orangehoney, or rasperryhoney almonds, by far my favorite item in the store (and ive tried almost everything).  Users/HaggroAlex

20060917 21:23:57 nbsp I love the Yolo Fruit Stand and will find myself making the weekly 10 mile round trip trek on my Vespa. BUT...this is a fairly decent but, the fruit, while cheap, in my experience hasnt been good at all. The vegetables taste alright though. But THE reason to come here is for the dried fruits and nuts. Theyre cheap and theyre delicious. My favorite is the dried cantalopue, but I havent seen that around lately. To give you an idea of the sorts of deals that abound here is my most recent shopping list: 1 cantalopue, one watermelon, two small avacados, one pound of peanuts, half a pound of dried peaches. Grand total: $7.10. Good times. Users/SteveKent

20061226 16:48:32 nbsp I stopped here once, it wasnt all that great. The fruit looked bad, (it was late in the season) and there were lots of flies. I prefer Pedricks near Winters.  Users/AmyGoogenspa

20070111 11:02:04 nbsp Wonderful fruits!! We bought oranges on the 1st from their employee recomendation, it was the sweetest orange Ive ever had. The stand is clean, the employees are friendly. Great atmospher! I can assure you I will be back. Users/KarenFernandez

20070219 18:05:40 nbsp I just bought some 10/$ kiwis and 2/$ avocados there. Cheap oranges too. Users/SteveDavison

20070316 10:26:19 nbsp Produce here is cheap which is great for those on a budget yet want to eat healthy. At times the produce can be rotten and that is because all of it is directly delivered from the farms and has not been thoroughly inspected like supermarkets. The staff tries their best to deliver only the freshest produce but at times be wary of finding something rotting. The fruits are extremely sweet especially during summer and the vegetables are tasty. My top picks are the peaches, corn (5 for a $1!!), tomatoes (very cheap), watermelons (11c/lb). The dried fruits and nuts are also a great deal. Excellent for creating a quick and healthy snack.  Users/BrandonToo

20070414 09:40:46 nbsp I got a wiki profile just so I could comment on this page! Awesome deals on everything from asparagus to assam. Shop here and keep them open! Users/harris

20070518 15:50:53 nbsp My brother worked here for a little bit, he enjoyed it Users/StevenDaubert

20070524 21:55:27 nbsp I would not suggest using County Road 32A because some drivers are pretty aggressive on that side.  32B may look unsafe, but the drivers tend to make the road a bitless nerveracking.  It is not illegal to take up the whole road if there is no bike lane, but drivers may find it annoying.  Produce is much cheaper than Safeway, and it is just as good if not better.  I would suggest using this place to help reduce some of your grocery costs, and take a bike to this place if you can. Users/DavidTran

20070719 16:33:08 nbsp This place is the best in Davis i lived here for years and i am glad to say you are here better than the other place Users/dickjones

20070930 16:47:38 nbsp Love it! Users/maymay

20070930 22:08:23 nbsp I really like this place. They have the biggest selection of produce out of the fruit stands. my only complaint is that I wish they had more local produce. I believe their grapes(dixon) and honey(woodland) are the only local items there. Pedrick Produce has a few more local items, and the produce is a little fresher and cleanier, but the prices are slightly higher (still way less than safeway).  Users/MattHh

20071008 11:03:09 nbsp MattHh, Take the E. Chiles Road exit just as youre getting off the causeway; turn right at the stop sign, itll take you under the causeway and onto County Road 32b where the market is. Users/jasonm

20071229 19:21:30 nbsp OMG, this place WAS good until this summer, the change of management. you never know if the stuff they r selling is fresh or not!!! I am telling the truth! Every time they find a bag with a hole on it, they just rebag the item. Sometimes, the holes are from the mice and THEY DUN CARE!!! One time, they found bugs and eggs in the pistachio bags, they just pull all the pistachio in to a box and pick out the ones with eggs on it and then bag the rest.    That is y the stuff there are cheaper. Users/Woan
  Its a farmers market.  I hate to tell you this, but the mice had sex underneath and slept in your produce when it was in the field.  There were plenty of bugs crawling all over it all season, and the plants were rooted in dirt.  That also applies to everything at Safeway.  Wash it off and itll be okay, I promise.  Youre just seeing the tail end of it being an actual part of nature rather than the fake sterility of the shrinkwrapped produce found in megamarts and Trader Joes.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
damn jabber your good! Daubert

20080101 I LOVE this store!! They have the freshest produce everyday! And the cheapest...i swear I AM telling the truth!!! I go shop there almost every weekend and everytime they have been SOOO caring and nice! Also they give credit for anything you buy! ITS GREAT!! Also they are getting more organic and local produce! Also they have sooo many different nuts and dried fruit to choose from!! I LOVE IT! Users/aggiegurl

That is true and the employees do not use gloves when bagging nuts. Users/silverchloride

20080830 12:29:30 nbsp I like this place for being cheap. I only wish it wasnt so far out of the way so those of us without cars can get there. oh well.

As to the comments about the bugs, rotten fruit, and such: you must recognze that this is a green grocer, not safeway. I used to work in  the produce section of albertsons, and we threw away almost half of our product. If bananas werent green, we had to throw them out. If something was ripe, we had to throw it out. That is why its difficult to find ripe fruit at big grocery stores; no one will buy it so they have to throw it away. That is why prices are so high. If they tried to do that here, they would go broke, so they put out everything and let you get what you want. I like that better. At least you know what you are getting and can eat it that day.  Users/ascapoccia

20090204 15:47:56 nbsp This place is great. The fruit and vegetables are cheap and delicious. I had always meant to go in whenever we drive back from Sacramento, but always forget. Finally went in a couple weeks ago and I was surprised that I only had to pay $1.49 for a 1lb container of organic mixed spring greens! We thought maybe it was old or something, but it was still fresh! I was used to paying the $6.99 price at Nugget.  Users/Rachelottlinger

20090315 18:08:17 nbsp my girlfriend and i lovelovelove this place and we go at least once a week. the prices are excellent and the fruit/veggies are usually the best in the area. plus they are always very nice. Users/leiris

20090917 18:12:44 nbsp If you need anything to make savory Persian dishes, go here! They have EVERYTHING! Users/nooshpouya

20100409 00:00:34 nbsp Theyre the only place in town that sells the yummy Blackcurrant tea bags. Try the Asian peanuts! Users/LeeY

20110319 21:08:58 nbsp The first time I visited this place I really liked it.  The owners and employees were nice and so I thought I could work there for a long time, but after working there for a while, I realized I was accepting work without filling out a Wform and signing a contract.  I quite the job right away and havent been paid for the hours I put in.  Overall, this place has great customer service and a great selection of fruits and vegetables, but I wouldnt recommend working there unless you dont mind working under the table and being mistreated.                  Users/ArielWong

20110609 22:12:29 nbsp I went here for the first time today and loved it. The prices were great! Users/EliseKane

20110820 22:08:40 nbsp Pretty decent! The prices are good, and most of the fruit is delicious, but I bought a package (Yolo Fruit Stand brand) of dried fruit and there were about 5 strands of hair in it... shudder.  Users/Churro615

20120115 16:09:28 nbsp My husband and I do all of our produce shopping here.  They have an excellent selection and you cannot beat their prices. I always find what I need and it is evident the food has been allowed to properly ripen, unlike most of the produce from the grocery stores! Users/BlairSwadley

20120523 15:11:14 nbsp Does anyone know where the produce actually comes from? The prices are unbeatable, but I dont shop here much due to the fact that the produce is most likely covered in pesticides/chemicals. If it could be proven otherwise, the Yolo Fruit Stand would have a life long customer here. Users/FoodsterDan

20121103 17:51:51 nbsp Most of the produce is from Watsonville, Stockton and anywhere ranging within 100 miles of Davis. However, there are a few products from out of the country, such as Pineapples and garlic. Pesticides and chemicalwise control, I am uncertain, but for most food products it is not a huge deal.  Users/lovelovelove
  It is true that some fruits and vegetables absorb more pesticides than others.  The Environmental Working Group regularly puts out http://www.ewg.org/foodnews/summary/ lists of those that are particularly harmful and those that are OK.  Topping the Dirty Dozen Plus list are common foods such as apples, celery, bell peppers, peaches, and strawberries.  So, it is not quite accurate to say that for most food products it is not a big deal.  But yes, you have less to worry about, healthwise, with foods such as onions, sweet corn, pineapple, and avocado (these top the Clean 15 list).  That being said, there are other reasons to be concerned about the use of pesticides, such as the effects on other species, the effects on farmworkers, and the pesticide runoff.  (Garlic, out of the country??  Garlic is grown locally.  And a bit further afield is Gilroy, CA, the selfproclaimed garlic capital of the world).   Users/CovertProfessor

20130728 03:31:10 nbsp Yesterday I stopped by and picked up a pineapple and a couple avocados.  Great, ~7 bucks out the door.  Well, until I counted my change.  I gave the girl a $20 and some coins and got three bucks back.  So I dispute the change.

A woman with a heavy Russian accent comes over and tells me that she didnt have a $10 bill in her register before and now she does.  Really?  You noticed that from across the room?  So she says that shell review the tape.  So this lady counts the money in the girls drawer shes $5 short, in fact, so she _must_ have given me the correct change.  WHAT?!?!?  So the fact that shes off, but makes up for it with OTHER MISTAKES is acceptable???

In my head:  ARE YOU A CRAZY WOMAN????  She takes my number and says that shell give me a call if/when they review the tape (yeah, right) and it looks like she made a mistake.  Seriously, the girl is ALREADY fifteen dollars short!  (Im counting my ten in there as well because of her wonderful cash register skills.)

Pretty sure Im not going to get a call.  This place is okay.  Just watch yourself:  count your change, pay attention to your transaction, and call them on errors EARLY.  They can fabricate stories on the spot, and you may lose $10 if you dont keep track. Users/DavidBarnum

20140125 15:18:51 nbsp We just came back to West Sac after ten years away, so I understand why we never noticed it before.  That said, we appreciate the prices and the selection (need Armenian cucumbers, but theyve never been requested before).  Went crazy on our first visit today. Thank you, Tim and all.
