Providing clinically expert care, delivered by professionals in a spirit of loving service, they emphasize comfort through pain control and sophisticated symptom relief.

Yolo Hospice assigns a team of trained specialists to each patient and their loved ones because hospice is so much more than clinically caring for an ill patient. It takes a team to deliver the complement of care. The Yolo Hospice team for each patient is composed of a registered nurse, social worker, hospice aide, spiritual care counselor, volunteers and bereavement specialists. Each team member, regardless of specialty area, is attentive to the care of the whole person – body, mind and spirit.

For those who qualify for Medicare, and most other insurance, all health care related to the patient’s terminal illness is covered. This typically includes costs related to medical equipment like hospital beds, supplies such as gauze bandages and medications. 24hour access to nursing support is available. For those without coverage or the ability to pay, Yolo Hospice will still provide you with hospice care.
