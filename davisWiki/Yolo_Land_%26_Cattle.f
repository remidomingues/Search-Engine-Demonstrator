20090929 16:09:08 nbsp I had a cheeseburger from them on Wednesday a few weeks ago, and it was amazing! Simple and delicious.  Users/NickSchmalenberger

20090929 22:00:52 nbsp gonna have to try these guys then! Users/StevenDaubert

20090930 20:21:48 nbsp Have shared a 1/4 side from Yolo Land & Cattle twice.  The ground beef with a light sprinkle of salt and pepper makes the best hamburger youll ever have.  No need for fancy garnishes...if youre going to eat beef, I believe it should be in relatively small quantities and produced in the manner Yolo Land & Cattle delivers. Users/ScottLay

20110920 12:31:54 nbsp Amazing beef! We just bought a 1/4 beef from YL&C and it has been wonderful so far. Lean meat, but super tender and flavorful. Grassfed beef is wonderful for your health, and its even better when purchased locally, so I would highly recommend it. Plus, Karen is so easy to work with! Give it a try and youll never go back to super market beef again. Users/juliebates

20111126 23:13:35 nbsp Not only are they super nice people  theyre patient and helpful when explaining the niceties of different cuts, cooking techniques, etc.  the beef is genuinely terrific. She picked out a 7blade roast for me today, advised me on how to thaw and cook it for tonight, and the final product just about brought tears to my dads eyes. The fact is that what gets passed off as beef in this country often barely qualifies as food; Im perfectly happy to pay more and eat less when it tastes this good and is this much better for my body. Thanks for your hard, intelligent, and responsible work, YL&C! Users/Swilltopower
