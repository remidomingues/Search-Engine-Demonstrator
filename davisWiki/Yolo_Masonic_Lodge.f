Theyre just your local friendly bunch of wiki:wikipedia:Freemasonry Freemasons. Every year, they offer two $500 scholarships to local high school seniors. Yolo Lodge covers the communities of Davis, Dixon, Esparto, and Winters.

The official name of the lodge is the Yolo Lodge, as listed in the http://www.freemason.org/resources_lodgelist.php official directory of California Masonic lodges. The Yolo Lodge hall carries the name Athens & Silveyville as that was the name of the lodge that met there until their consolidation with Esparto lodge in March of 2007. Athens & Silveyville is a direct reference to both the Dixon area and Benicia.

Circa 1868, Silveyville was the only township in Northeast Solano County, and was a frequent stop for many traveling from Sacramento to Benicia in the gold rush days.  With the completion of the California Pacific Rail Road, many of the residents resettled along the railroad tracks in the area now known as Dixon.FootNote(http://www.cagenweb.com/solano/silveyville.htm) Benicia was known as the Athens of California  http://www.beniciahistoricalmuseum.org/benhist_1850.htm Benicia historical museum.

The physical structure of the Masonic Lodge was originally located in the space that is currently occupied by the address range of 221225 G Street.  The original building burnt down in the fire of 1916 but was quickly replaced by a new one that still exists and now houses businesses like Ground Zero.  The second story of the structure, 221 G Street, contained Masonic facilities up until some point, but the Freemasons began to gradually rent out all the rooms for commercial use.
