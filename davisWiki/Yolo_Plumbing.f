20130528 21:24:14 nbsp Wow! Yolo Plumbing is so great, we volunteered to create this site for him after doing a job at our house!  Experienced plumber since 1996, Joe has been in business on his own as Yolo Plumbing for a bit over a year.  Answers his own phone right away.  Responsive.  Replaced two valves same day we called.  Stuck to his bid even though the job was more involved (and took longer, into the dinner hour) than he planned.  He came recommended from a friend, and we were not disappointed.

20130826 02:40:20 nbsp Yolo Plumbing is fantastic!  I also had a great experience with them.
I initially contacted Joe (the owner of the business) after I decided to begin  upgrading the plumbing in my 45 year old house; I scheduled an initial visit to  review the plumbing issues I was most concerned about and prioritize the repairs. Joe arrived promptly at 5, and we started with an examination of the main water shutoff valve at the front of the house: although the valve wasnt  visibly leaking, a heavy deposit of limescale covered most of the bonnet, and I was concerned that the valve might suddenly fail. After examining the deposition pattern of the scale, Joe began removing some of the deposits to see if a point source could be located. At the base of the bonnet threads, he found a hairline crack which almost completely encircled the fitting (Fig. 1). The limescale deposit had evidently sealed the crack temporarily, which is why the valve did not appear to be leaking. Water started leaking out of the crack after the scale was removed, and so Joe called his partner Jeremy, and they proceeded to repair the valve that evening. I watched the process and was impressed with both his skill and the care he took at each step ( e.g. preparation of pipe surfaces before soldering, etc). The repaired shutoff valve with the new brass ball valve is shown in Fig.2the quality of the soldered joints can be seen. The following day they repaired the leaking hose bib at the back of the house: this involved removing a small area of siding to determine how far the leak extended into the wall.  They replaced the corroded iron piping with copper pipes and replaced the leaking gate valve with a brass ball valveagain, a beautiful job. They also completed several minor repairs, including replacing the fill valve and supply valve for a toilet, a tub diverter in a shower, and a bathroom sink trap.  Before starting each repair, Joe gave me an estimate of the approximate cost of the materials and the time it would take to complete them. After the repairs were completed, he gave me a  detailed receipt, in which the plumbing problems were described, and all the replacement parts were listed (including their dimensions). The receipt thus provides a useful record of the specific repairs that were were done. The repaired plumbing has functioned beautifully.

Yolo Plumbing embodies the best qualities of a local, independent business: years of experience, familiarity with local conditions (such as the chronic effects of the citys hard water on plumbing), exceptional craftsmanship, and absolute integrity in their work. Finally, both Joe and Jeremy were more than willing to share their extensive knowledge and experience regarding the challenges of maintaining an older house; I learned a great deal. I totally recommend Yolo Plumbing for any aspect of plumbing maintenance or repair.
