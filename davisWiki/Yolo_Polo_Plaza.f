A small shopping centers shopping center anchored by WalMart. There is no major crossstreet but it is located on Main St. just west of County Road 102 and east of the Interstate 5 onramp.  The center was built on an old polo field used by the http://sportclubs.ucdavis.edu/horsepolo UC Davis Polo Team, which explains the humorous name.

The Home Depot lot used to be separate from the WalMart/Staples plaza until mid2005, when a new building (housing Mobile Phones Cingular, Matthews Mattress, In Style Nails, and Supercuts) and parking lot were added between them.

20051028 16:24:35 nbsp The dorky name has only been added in the last few years when they added the strip mall and the Applebees.  Before that is was just the WalMart and Home Depot. The rhyming and alliteration make my wife giggle as well. Users/RogerClark

20060407 13:09:10 nbsp It was named Yolo Polo because the whole thing was built on the field where everyone played polo. With ponies and everything. Now the polo field has moved out to Highway 113 right before you get to Knights Landing... they do games in the mornings on Saturdays and Sundays in summer, and people are welcome to come out and watch.
