Daily use fees for the rifle and pistol ranges are now $9.00 without membership, and $3.00 with membership ($3.00 day use for trap and skeet ranges for non members). The fee includes two cardboard targets.  YSA also offers ear plugs (ear protection required) in the clubhouse for $0.50. Safety goggles are also available for $5.

Membership isnt required to use their ranges. They have 10 yard handgun, 25 yard handgun/rifle, 50 yard rifle, and 100 yard rifle ranges, 2 trap/skeet ranges, and a sporting clays range. A string of trap (25 clays) for nonmembers is $7.00. Bring your own guns, and ammo. They have voice and remote activated pull mechanisms. On the weekends (Saturday/Sunday), you can usually get one of the kids to pull trap for you (you know... sit behind you and press the button when you say Pull!) Sporting clay shooting is only available during Spring and Summer.

You can bring your own steel targets for the rifle range, but you can only use them on the 50 and 100yard ranges.

You can hear rounds being fired from this club in West Davis when there is an inversion layer (layer of hot air above the surface air).

20060129 20:41:01 nbsp This place rocks, glad I dont have to go all the way to Vacaville to shoot things Users/ApolloStumpy

20080809 13:28:41 nbsp anyone know of a place to get ammo for cheap? Users/atwong

20080809 20:06:42 nbsp Not around Davis....WalMart is cheaper than Big 5 though. If you dont mind ordering online, try ammoman.com Users/PatrickFish

20080818 00:33:55 nbsp Just went to Walmart on the 80.  WOW, lots of ammo for cheap. I got an box of 100 shotgun shells for only $21.    Users/atwong

20100207 12:07:36 nbsp You can use normal shotgun ammo at the shotgun lanes where you shoot clay pigeons in the air, you need the slugs only for the normal lanes shooting at a stationary target. Users/UCLance

20100618 11:16:57 nbsp I went there thursday 6/17 and joined for the year...  took my 8 year old to shoot her new 22...  she had a ball.  Paul was rangemaster, and he was very nice, friendly, patient with my daughter.  it was great.  my daughter wants to go back every week.  this place is definitely not corporate but it is a great place and a super resource for the community.   Users/Carsonsig

20100817 12:53:03 nbsp Quit telling people about this place.....shhhhhhhhhh Users/DavidAlvarez

20101108 17:28:50 nbsp I just purchased a Rossi 12 gauge single action shotgun seeing how Ive never bought a shotgun before I was wondering if I was limited to only shooting trap and skeet or could I break it in with some target shooting if I used some rifle slugs. Users/AlexBianco

20101110 14:42:56 nbsp @AlexBianco  When shooting a shotgun on the pistol and rifle ranges, only slugs are allowed. You can use shotshells on the trap and skeet ranges. Users/ZDavid

20101130 21:20:27 nbsp Range helper on skeet wasnt friendly. You can only use target loads for skeet, one shell loaded at a time. This was not posted anywhere, you are somehow expected to know this. I prefer Center of Mass for pistol shooting. And http://www.natchezss.com/ has great prices, too bad we in California wont be able to order ammo over internet as of February 2011 as a result of AB 962 and the requirement that you must submit a thumbprint for handgun ammo purchases. See http://www.ab962.org for more info. Users/AdamGetchell

20110812 13:26:02 nbsp So I wanted to try this place out, but I am a bit confused.  Do I need to have a gun and ammo to shoot here, or do they have guns I can rent and ammo I can buy??  I dont have a gun, but enjoy going to shooting ranges with my brothers and I thought it would be nice to spend an afternoon here. Users/AdreanaRubio

20130902 12:40:32 nbsp YSA is a shooting range only. They do not rent guns, although they used sell shotgun shells in the past. I do some of my training courses there. I like to teach my classes early on weekends to avoid the crowd. Users/waltlucas
