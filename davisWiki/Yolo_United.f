Yolo United is the campaign arm of the Yolo County Democratic Party Democratic Central Committee.  The Davis office opened on 20080817.

The office is hosting phone banking events Monday, Wednesday, and Friday 48pm before the November 2008 Presidential Election November 4, 2008 election. Volunteers are calling California voters and swing state voters before the election, reminding people to vote. People with cell phones (or laptops with http://www.skype.com/ Skype accounts) and some time on their hands are encouraged to drop in and help. If you dont have a cell phone or Skype, thats fine; the office has phones you can use.

This is a good location to buy Obama paraphernalia, including buttons, lawn signs, bumper stickers, etc.
