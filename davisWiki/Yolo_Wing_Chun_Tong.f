Wing Chun is a style of kung fu developed by a Buddhist nun based on the snake and crane.  It is a southern Chinese martial art which has lately been popularized in the Ip Man movies.

Women may find the art easier to learn than men since it is a soft style which stresses position, sensitivity, and skill rather than overt muscular strength.  However, classes are suitable for adults who wish to learn a traditional kung fu style.

This club is starting from scratch.  If you are on campus then definitely check out the UCD Wing Chun Club.

Brief instructor statement:  I have been a student of Wing Chun since 1995.  My teacher is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Chung Chung MaanNin (Kenneth), who learned from Leung Sheung, who learned from Ip Man.  My longterm goal with this club is to build up a group with solid Wing Chun skills and with a strong cooperative work ethic.  If you practice on your own fairly diligently, you should be able to learn everything I can do in a couple of years.  Then, we can work together to get even better.
