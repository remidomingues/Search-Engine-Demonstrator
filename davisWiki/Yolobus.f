All buses are equipped with Bicycles bike racks, which hold two to three bicycles. Theyre actually pretty simple to use. Make sure the driver sees you and knows youre about to step in front of the bus when you go to load your bike. When you get off, remind the driver that you have a bike so he or she knows youre about to step in front of the bus.

Some drivers have suggested swiping day passes through the magnetic strip reader because the ticket slot sometimes jams and wont return your pass.

 Tips 
  Yolobus serves Davis with eleven routes (42A, 42B, 43, 43R, 44, 220, 220C, 230, 231, 232, and 242), however all except the http://www.yolobus.com/42.html #42 are express or commute buses which operate only during peak hours for bringing people to and from work.

There are two #42 circuits: 42A (the inner/clockwise circuit) and 42B (the outer/counterclockwise circuit). There are two 42A buses and two 42B buses (think of a Beryllium atom). They are timed to arrive 30 minutes apart. It takes exactly 60 minutes to travel between Davis Anderson@Hanover and Sacramento L@13th in either direction, with a full circuit taking 2 hours exactly. Thus, it doesnt matter which bus you take if you are going between Davis and downtown Sacramento. Beware that the last bus leaves Sacramento at 10:35PM weekdays, and 8:35PM on weekends.

  From Davis, Bus 42A is the most direct route to the Sacramento Airport (SMF) (42B back to Davis). It takes about 46 minutes, including the dead time at County Fair Mall.  42 Clockwise (42 A) picks up at the MU depot and proceeds up Anderson, just like the Unitrans G line, before leaving Davis.  To get back, take 42 Counterclockwise (42 B); pick it up at a public transportation bus stop, across the street from baggage claim at SMF (Sacto Intergalactic) terminals A and B.

  Route 220 can get you to the shopping area of Vacaville, but it only runs 34 times per day, so youll have to plan.

  For people taking classes at the main campus of Sacramento City College, youll need to transfer over to the Sacramento RT in downtown Sac. When taking the bus from Davis to Sac, get out at those first stops near L or J Streets and either catch the 62 RT bus or the Meadowview bound light rail, both of which take you directly to campus. Light rail is always quicker, but if you want to catch a bite to eat or something, the 62 heads down J Street until 19th, passing through the heart of midtown Sac.




20071006 14:55:59 nbsp Whats the deal with it having to say where its going as loud as possible at 6 A.M., exactly? Wouldnt anyone whos actually up at that time already know where its going anyways? Users/KokoSorensen

20071104 19:20:52 nbsp You would be surprised how many people forget to pull the line for their stops...again I commute everyday...so i see it all the time.  Users/ArianeMetz

20080726 11:16:45 nbsp It would be great if one of the Davis supermarkets sold the monthly passes and express passes.  Otherwise, if you want to buy a pass during nonbusiness hours, the only option is driving to the Bel Air or Raleys in Woodland.  I just emailed Nugget market to ask them to carry it.

20110101 15:10:26 nbsp Route 42 rocks!  It is almost as convenient as SuperShuttle and the Davis Airporter.  And who can argue with a $2 fare, much less a free ride for students. Users/GregKuperberg

20110417 13:56:58 nbsp 42 a is better   Users/AliciaCardoza

20110417 14:58:16 nbsp The air conditioners on the YoloBus are legit.

20110526 22:40:14 nbsp Is the yolobus still free with an I.D. card even if it is not one of the buses that serves the Davis area? Users/Haylie
   It should be free for any Yolobus regardless of location. People do take buses to Sacramento and then transfer to other Yolobuses going somewhere else. Users/MaxLucas
