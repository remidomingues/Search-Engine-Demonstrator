Its a common misconception that Yoohoo is some kind of chemical concoction, but it dates back to the 1920s and the key ingredient is actually a really old and classic one: whey.  As in curds and whey, the stuff Miss Muffet was eating when sitting on her tuffet in the nursery poetry rhyme.  Its also got real cocoa.   So it is basically the stuff left over from the first step of making cheese, sweetened (like most drinks it switched to highfructose corn syrup sometime in the last century), and chocolate flavored.  Since whey is more stable than milk, it can sit on a shelf rather than having to be refrigerated.  Note: even though this drink isnt a chemical enigma, its pretty unhealthy; each serving contains more sugar than the recommended daily maximum.
