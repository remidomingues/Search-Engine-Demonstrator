Yosemite Valley

Yosemite valley is home to some of Yosemites most popular and recognizable attractions. The immediately recognizable Half Dome is located at the far east end of the valley and towers 4,737 feet above the valley floor. Glacier Point is situated just to the south of Half Dome and is considered one of the most popular viewpoints for looking out over the valley from an elevation of 7,214 feet. Yosemite Falls which is located more near the center of the valley drops a astonishing 2,425 feet making it the sixth tallest waterfall in the wold. And El Capitan which is a massive wall of granite, rising abruptly at almost a perfect 90degree angle to the valley floor. El Capitan stretches almost 3,000 feet from base to summit and is a wildly popular recreational spot for rock climbers from all around the world.

High Country and Tuolumne Meadows
Yosemites high country is home to Tuolumne Meadows, which bursts with wildflowers and lush grasses during the spring and summer seasons. Highway 120 crosses this area en route to Mono Lake and Nevada and is only open in the summer and fall. Other points of interest include Tenaya Lake, Tioga Pass, and the various domes that dot the landscape.

Glacier Point Road
Glacier Point Road, also open in the summer and fall, passes through the Badger Pass Ski Area en route to Taft Point and Glacier Point. Both viewpoints offer stunning views of Yosemite Falls, Yosemite Valley, Half Dome, Vernal Falls, Nevada Falls, Tenaya Canyon, and other landmarks.

Hetch Hetchy
The Hetch Hetchy area features the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, formed by OShaughnessy Dam in 1923, and the Tueeulala and Wapama Falls. OShaughnessy Dam was built on the Tuolumne River after the area received protection as a National Park and drowned what John Muir called Yosemites twin. The area provides access to various trails that traverse the Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne. Today, there is talk of removing the dam to restore the valley. Hetch Hetchy can be reached via Evergreen Road, which leaves Highway 120 just west of the parks Big Oak Flat entrance.
