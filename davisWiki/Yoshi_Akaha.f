     A five to six diver crew of pirates performed for Sacremento audiences at the 2005 California State Fair by invite of Dana Kunze.  Yoshi performed dillies or clown dives along with olympic style dives upwards of 20 feet off the ground.  An aboveground tank filled with between 9 and 10 feet of water left the divers no margin for error upon entry.  The masts on each ship had small perches at heights of approximately 40 and 80 feet in the air from which all the divers leapt, fell, flipped, and dove while also reciting comical scripts to match each character.  Yoshi learned multiple roles: Frenchie, Scully, Oscar, Popeye, and Igor.  Each show was capped off by an aweenducing eighty foot plummet from the top mast where the stars of the show dared a drawn out, floating, backflip.
Talent for the show came by way of Sacramento, El Dorado Hills, Auburn, Fairfield, Monterey, Walnut Creek, Berkeley, New York, Texas, and Mexico City.

This is his best friend:
She is pretty much a genius when it comes to Spanish.  She has an engaging personality, which is important for a shyer guy like Yoshi.  Shes really friendly.  As gorgeous as this girl is, she is not too intimidating.  She is a lifeguard!  Thats right... She works in a bikini.  Shes a world traveler.  Shes athletic with talents in gymnastics and badminton.  She has an artistic eye and has an innate ability to bring out the essence of beauty from any poem, any movie, any photograph, any speech.  She is firm in her beliefs.  She doesnt smoke for health reasons.  She endulges in the advantages, freedoms, and privileges of being an American in a dignified manner and, like a pro, manages to simultaneously balance all of her obligations and commitments.  Her middle name is Renee.  She has been known to say, Is that your video camera or your picture camera? Iz thāt yōl vĭdēō kāmwŭ ōə yōl pĭchŭl kāmwŭ.  She is a well balanced individual.  She is socially liberal and fiscally conservative.  She enjoys White Girl Alone Time.  She is entertained by AIMs emoticon showers.  She pouts enough for our entire generation.  She is 21.  She appreciates the clear advantages of living in the US, but still values sentimentality and appreciates the thought behind actions, such as gift giving.  Her favorite color is purple.  She is a go with the flow girl.  When attitudes are in alignment with an available option, she tends to go with it.  This shows that she is spontaneous.  She lives each day embrasing chance and is open to new experiences.  She likes sushi and flaming hot cheetos.  She is energetic.  If she were 5 9 I would suggest she try modeling.  However she is a shorter more cuddly package than a runway model.  She is not afraid of being herself.  She likes elephants.  She likes palm trees.  She likes to challenge...everyone (authority figures are no exception).  She can trash talk with the best.  She has equal wit and has a talent for comedy.  She can recite, from memory, lines from movies and lyrics from songs as easily as google.com!  She can impersonate morons and mimic cartoons with great accuracy.  She likes Sex on The Beaches, only with her own little spin on it.  Yoshi says: Te extraño, ¡bocadito de mi corazón!
