http://www.ysdhc.com was a DIY webzine and forum. This means that all the content on the page was submitted by the people who visited it.

Beyond the website, YSDHC is a brutally crucial xCREWx who will totally hit you in the head with a lead pipe if you so much as look at us the wrong way.

YSDHC began as a website created for the purpose of putting food reviews, videos, and fart jokes on the internet. Then, for a while, it was a forum where Davis locals shared their love of hardcore/metal/punk etc. At the time it was a great place to meet people and find out about upcoming shows.

Our homies rolled deep at The Loyola House.
