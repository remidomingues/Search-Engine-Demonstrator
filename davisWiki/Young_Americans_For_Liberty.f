The restoration of habeas corpus?  Or, like so many libertarians, does your liberty extend only to the right to earn profit regardless of consequences to others? Users/CovertProfessor
   While their specifics are not spelled out on their website, they distribute copies of the US Constitution, and their platform includes the antisearch and seizure phrase, THAT respect for the individuals property is fundamental to a peaceful society; and the phrase THAT the individual owns his/her body and is therefore responsible for his/her actions;, which tends to be we support getting rid of drug laws, but we dont want to look like looneysFootnote(Im not calling prolegalization groups looneys here.).  I know Ron Paul was very much against federal drug laws and the War on Drugs policies, and was prohabeas corpus for military detainees.  Of course, the local chapter may bend from the national org and their origins.  jw
    So many  how many? All of the libs I know are in favor of those things and not just their right to earn profits so where do you get the many from? Im sure some exist, Ive just never experienced that.  All the people I met who youve described are Republicans. Users/OliviaY
    That sounds promising.  Id like to see where most of their efforts lie, however, not just what they say that they support.   Users/CovertProfessor

20120828 23:19:57 nbsp Any response to the RNC disrespecting Ron Paul and his supporters tonight at the convention? I have mixed feelings about Ron Paul but I tend to vote Libertarian and think what the Republicans did to him will further alienate them from young voters. Users/MikeyCrews
