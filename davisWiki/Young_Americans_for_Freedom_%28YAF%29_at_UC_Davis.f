Young Americans for Freedom (YAF) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization and is now a project of Young Americas Foundation. YAF is an ideologically conservative youth activism organization. The Young Americans for Freedom brings on campus political activism, fighting for Conservatives causes, while avoiding the partisan bickering of the 2 party system.  Young Americans for Freedoms goal at UC Davis is to provide a more Conservative alternative to the College Republican group on campus, free of the rigid orthodoxy of partisan politics. The Davis YAF only recently launched, as of April 2012, providing a much needed Conservative Voice on a liberal campus, which has seen its College Republican group drift in a different direction.

The YAF at UC Davis, on September 11, released a press release saying:
Davis, CA – Today, the Young Americans for Freedom (YAF) at UC Davis memorialized those who died on September 11, 2001, placing a flag in the ground for each victim, in the Shape of “911: NEVER FORGET.”
The Young Americans for Freedom (YAF) at UC Davis is led by Jonathan Soo Hoo, a 3rd year at UC Davis, who already previously served on statewide and national leadership teams promoting Conservative Candidates for elected office. Jonathan lead the 9/11 Never Forget memorial, placing 2,977 flags into the ground just off the quad, to commemorate the 2,977 individuals who lost their lives 11 years ago.
The 9/11: Never Forget Project began as a project of the Young Americans Foundation, which sponsors Young Americans for Freedom. The 9/11: Never Forget Project seeks to draw students together, regardless of political biases, and rise above Partisan Politics. The Project rallies a few common goals:
1.	We must honor those who lost their lives on September 11
2.	We must not forget the memory of those who lost their lives
The goals constitute neither a conservative nor liberal positions, but, rather, American positions.
The Event on the UC Davis Campus generated a considerable amount of buzz from those who observed. Yong Americans for Freedom (YAF) at UC Davis President, Jonathan Soo Hoo explained, “It’s great to see so many individuals who genuinely appreciate and care about the memory of September 11.  The interest in this project from individuals of different political affiliations, religious affiliations, values, ages, genders, and races, serves as a constant reminder: No matter how much partisanship tries to divide us, we know only one America – The United States of America.”
The Young Americans for Freedom (YAF) at UC Davis, began earlier this year, focusing promoting Conservatives causes, while transcending the partisan politics. The YAF at UC Davis, promotes the role of government only to equalize the opportunities in life.



No More Che Day

Che Guevara is recognized as a liberal Icon. The Young Americans for Freedom (YAF) at UC Davis had a No More Che Day, handing out posters around campus saying, The Victims of Che Guevara and saying, Che Guevara was an international terrorist and mass murder. During his vicious campaigns to impose communism on countries throughout Latin America, Che Guevara trained and motivated the Castro regimes firing squads that executed thousands of men, women, and children.

A copy of the poster is available here:






Parent Organization

YAF is an ideologically conservative youth activism organization that was founded in 1960, as a coalition between traditional conservatives and libertarians.


Mission

Official Statement

The purposes of YAF are to advocate public policies consistent with the Sharon Statement, which was adopted by young conservatives at a meeting at the home of Mr. William F. Buckley in Sharon, Connecticut on September 11, 1960; To promote social welfare and individual freedom; To study any legislation from any governmental bodies or agencies that seek to affect social and economic problems of the individual; To support the preservation and enhancement of individual freedom for all Americans; To provide aid and information to students and such young adults throughout the nation to assist them in achieving and maintaining the ideological realization of the beliefs in the Sharon Statement; and to maintain and operate a chapter based organization with national, regional and local networks throughout the United State of America.

UC Davis Chapter Statement

Previously, Young Americans for Freedom played a vital role in the development of the modern Conservative movement.  We want to bring that to UC Davis, encouraging young college students to fight for Conservative values, and become individuals who create other branches of Conservative groups, or become leaders in the Conservative movement, such as former YAF Members: Jeff Sessions (Republican US Senator), or Mark Levin (Conservative talk show host).

Sharon Statement

IN THIS TIME of moral and political crisis, it is the responsibility of the youth of America to affirm certain eternal truths.
WE, as young conservatives, believe:
THAT foremost among the transcendent values is the individuals use of his Godgiven free will, whence derives his right to be free from the restrictions of arbitrary force;
THAT liberty is indivisible, and that political freedom cannot long exist without economic freedom;
THAT the purpose of government is to protect those freedoms through the preservation of internal order, the provision of national defense, and the administration of justice;
THAT when government ventures beyond these rightful functions, it accumulates power, which tends to diminish order and liberty;
THAT the Constitution of the United States is the best arrangement yet devised for empowering government to fulfill its proper role, while restraining it from the concentration and abuse of power;
THAT the genius of the Constitution  the division of powers  is summed up in the clause that reserves primacy to the several states, or to the people in those spheres not specifically delegated to the Federal government;
THAT the market economy, allocating resources by the free play of supply and demand, is the single economic system compatible with the requirements of personal freedom and constitutional government, and that it is at the same time the most productive supplier of human needs;
THAT when government interferes with the work of the market economy, it tends to reduce the moral and physical strength of the nation, that when it takes from one to bestow on another, it diminishes the incentive of the first, the integrity of the second, and the moral autonomy of both;
THAT we will be free only so long as the national sovereignty of the United States is secure; that history shows periods of freedom are rare, and can exist only when free citizens concertedly defend their rights against all enemies…
THAT the forces of international Communism are, at present, the greatest single threat to these liberties;
THAT the United States should stress victory over, rather than coexistence with this menace; and
THAT American foreign policy must be judged by this criterion: does it serve the just interests of the United States?

Philosophy

Since its founding, YAF continuously identified itself as conservative. However, the term conservative has changed in meaning over several generations. Before World War II, most American conservatives were noninterventionist. But as the Cold War began to dominate American foreign policy, the old conservatism disintegrated. After Robert Taft was defeated for the Republican nomination in 1952, noninterventionist conservatism mostly vanished. In the 1950s, a new kind of conservatism arose. This new ideology was formulated in large part by the newspaper Human Events, the magazine National Review, and National Reviews editor William F. Buckley, Jr. This new conservatism combined freemarket economics, respect for traditional values, orderly society and anticommunism.

In the late 1960s, the term libertarianism began to be used for a political philosophy. Many of those who popularized this term were initially part of the conservative movement, but came to separate themselves from the conservatives on certain issues. Libertarians within YAF believed, for example, the military draft was a violation of the individual freedom the organization claimed to embrace. To oppose it they were willing to reject existing laws against burning draft cards and supported those who fled to Canada or went underground when drafted for military service. The conservatives (or traditionalists as they were sometimes called)also opposed the draft directed their efforts towards changing the law. In the end, the goals of both groups were achieved, and YAF was in the forefront of the drive to end the draft and create a volunteer military.
After 1969, the relationship between conservatives and libertarians in YAF was often rocky. A majority of members identified themselves simply as conservative, but some identified as both conservative and libertarian, and still others identified themselves simply as libertarian. From time to time, power struggles broke out; when this happened, the libertarians almost always ended up losing.

In later years, new viewpoints would be amalgamated by the conservative movement, including neoconservatism in the early 1970s, the New Right in the late 1970s and the Religious Right in the 1980s. Some YAF members identified with some of these philosophies, others opposed them and still others were content to simply identify themselves as conservative without further specificity.

Since its founding, YAF members on college campuses focused primarily on national and international politics, rather than oncampus politics. Thus members were much more likely to pass out handbills for a candidate for Congress than for student body president.
