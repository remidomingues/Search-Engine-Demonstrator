address(Young Hall, 38.542432,121.747777) houses the Psychology and Anthropology departments. 198 Young is the Campus Lecture Halls lecture hall. The building is east of the Memorial Union MU and south of the Death Star.  Rumor is, the psychologists and anthropologists are the reason for the existence of the Death Star.  They wanted to perform experiments on students in mazes so they disguised it as a building.  Unlucky students that wander in and lose their way (if not sanity) are observed by the Psych department researchers.  Those that make it out sometimes find Middle Eastern or Asian food.  The unlucky ones are eaten.  The remains of past students are studied by the physical anthropologists.

Young Hall is divided into northern and southern wings.  The northern wing is inhabited by psychologists and the southern wing is mixed.  The psychologists have staked out the first floor of the south wing and the anthropologists have been squished into the second and third floor.  The dark, foreboding basement is occupied by Grad Students grad students.  Some think that Trolls trolls live in the basement, but its not trueeven trolls are afraid of the basement in Young Hall.

The psych department conducts research through a program called https://experimetrix2.com/ucdavis/ Experimetrix.  These experiments are in the north wing.  Often times, the experimentees cant find their rooms and get lost on the 2nd floor of the south wing.  When this happens, the Behavioral and Evolutionary Ecology behavioral ecologists get out their stop watches and test theorems from foraging theory.  Invariably, we take pity on them and point them to the north wing.

There are also some people locked up in rooms in the corridor connecting the north and south wings.  However, nobody knows who they are or what they do.  They are rarely seen and never complain when the lights go out.  Sometimes we leave snacks outside their doors to tempt them out.  It doesnt work.  But the snacks are always gone in the morning...

In between the north and south wings is the courtyard.  Here people often practice different artforms like juggling or martial arts or Davis Period Fencing Club fencing; pretty fun to watch.

The basement of the north wing was used in the early stages of The Manhattan Project to figure out ways to process Uranium before the project moved to Oak Ridge, TN.  The Basement still has slightly higher than normal radiation readings, but not enough to do any harm.  Young Hall was originally called the Chemistry Building, and was constructed in 1941.

Leaving Young by the southwest doors, you might run into Stargazer.






20110130 11:44:25 nbsp Has anyone else heard of Young Hall being haunted? Once in the early morning I was waiting for a T.A. to come to her office in the basement, and I bent down to pick up something I dropped. I noticed that someone was standing directly behind me, and, thinking that it was my T.A., I immediately straightenedup and turned aroundno one was there.  Users/ArianeMetz
