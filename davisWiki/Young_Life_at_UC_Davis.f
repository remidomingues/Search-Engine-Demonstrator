Young Life is an interdenominational Christianity Christian organization for high school and college students.  The hope of YL at UCD is to create a vibrant, welcoming community of college students who want to figure out what it means to live life to the full.  They will do this through living life together.  Adventure. Regular gatherings. Real conversations about life and Jesus.  All are welcome!

Regardless of where students are in their religious beliefs, Young Life College offers them a community to be a part of where they can enjoy college and be loved for who they are. As caring adults venture with them, college students are nurtured, guided and encouraged to explore who Jesus Christ is and what it means in life.

Young Life (outreach to high school students) and Wyld Life (outreach to middle school students) has had a presence here in the YoloSolano Counties in the past.  Their vision is to reach UCD students and also find volunteers who desire to be Young Life and Wyld Life leaders to reach local schools.
