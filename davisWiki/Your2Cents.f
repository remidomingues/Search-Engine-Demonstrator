20130625 13:05:20 nbsp What did I say that was defamatory or negative towards another business?  Nothing.  I went there unbiased as possible and stated the facts of my visit.  I didnt go there as Aaron, Owner of a competing shop, I went as Aaron interested Davis resident wondering what they do and how they are different from every other shop.  I have a wonderful relationship with nearly EVERY shop in Davis and Sacramento. Users/Aaron.Curtin

You visited the shop as Aaron, but shared your experiences as someone else. Do you see how that is disingenuous ? ~SD

  Sure  Aaron
