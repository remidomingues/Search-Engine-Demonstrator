The Youth and Young Adult Clinic at UC Davis Medical Center offers free services to teens and young adults 13 and older, to encourage young people to better manage their reproductive health. According to the http://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/children/newsroom/newsdetail.html?key4184&svrhttp://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu&tablepublished press release, the clinic offers all reproductive healthcare services, including pregnancy testing, sexually transmitted infection testing, diagnosis of painful urination (which can be a symptom of sexually transmitted infection in males), and irregular periods (which can be a symptom of infertility). The clinic is not offering free treatment for conditions unrelated to reproductive health. Individuals utilizing the service need not be established patients of UC Davis.

The services, which are offered by the Department of Pediatrics in the General Pediatrics Clinic, are not being billed to patientsâ€™ insurance, regardless of whether they have private health coverage through their parents.  In California all adolescents have the right to receive confidential reproductive healthcare services.
