Youth for Recovery, or YFR, is a youth drug treatment program serving all of Yolo County run by Communicare Community Clinics.  They offer two programs: Afterschool and Day Treatment. The Afterschool program meets 23 days per week from 45:30 pm in Woodland, and West Sacramento.  The Day Treatment program is a more intensive program, meeting five days per week in Woodland (Cache Creek High School). Both individual and group counseling is required.  For some, family and mental health counseling is offered. Individuals are drug tested on a regular basis (23 times per week in the beginning), and weekly attendance at a NA or AA meeting is  also required.  Parents are required to attend 8 support group meetings at any time during their childs treatment.

They used to be active in Davis but appear to have stopped holding programs locally.

 Dress Code 

Youth for Recovery has a dress code.  In addition to the usual prohibition against clothing that glorifies drugs or alcohol, or clothing that may be interpreted as demeaning or offensive, there is a prohibition against wearing anything red or blue.  Davis kids will need to pay attention to this as most will never think about blue being gangrelated, especially when Davis High Schools colors are blue and white (Go Blue Devils!) and UCDs colors are blue and gold (Go Ags!). Regardless, Youth for Recovery bans the wearing of blue (or red) to school, treatment or court. (Denim jeans are OK.)

 Relapse Policy 

Relapse on the program occurs with: The use of any addictive drug or alcohol; The use of any addictive medication or medication containing alcohol (i.e. Nyquil); The use of any other addictive substance; The excessive use of any medication, even if it is not addictive.

Other positive tests include failing to test or suspected manipulation of the test, such as a diluted urine test (through adding water to the sample or drinking too much water).  These are treated in the same way as a test positive for use of drugs.

If the relapse is revealed due to the urine test, the client is returned to Phase I for 30 days.  If the client selfreports prior to testing, they will remain on the current phase, but will need to be clean for 30 days before moving on to the next phase.  Even if selfreported, if there is consistent relapses the client may have to attend increased NA/AA meetings, moved back to a previous phase or referred to a residential program (short or long term).

If there is a relapse, the client is given 48 hours to tell their parents and, if on probation, their Probation Officer.
Communicare staff are supposed to wait 24 hours before calling the parents and Probation Officer to discuss what will happen with the clients treatment plan, however staff tend to contact Probation immediately.

There have been complaints that the staff also fail to contact parents when there is a problem and by doing so neglects to involve parents in the childs treatment plan. Despite their childs minority status, along with signed releases by the child authorizing the clinic to release information to parents, etc., parents are often left out of the loop. A child can misbehave, miss meetings or even relapse and the parents may never find out from the program staff, unless the child is also appearing in Yolo County Juvenile Drug Court and is informed by the Juvenile Drug Court Judge or Probation Officer or their child voluntarily tells the parent.

 Yolo County Drug Court 
See also: Juvenile Justice System

While many clients arrive at Youth for Recovery from referrals through schools or physicians, the Yolo County Juvenile Drug Court uses Youth for Recovery as its primary treatment plan for teens that are arrested for drug offenses or other crimes where drugs is thought to be a significant factor, or where there is a violation of probation with substance abuse as an identified issue.

As of August 2008, Juvenile Drug Court provides outpatient drug and alcohol treatment for moderatehigh or high risk minors.  Those minors that are lower risk will be provided treatment and intervention services without the intensive delinquencyfocused setting of the Juvenile Drug Court model.
