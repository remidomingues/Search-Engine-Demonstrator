Yummy Dummy Chocolate Company was started by seven young Davis local girls (Sedona, Stream, Rachel, Rowan, Bay, Risa and Sara).  They specialized in allnatural dark chocolate.  They sold their chocolate at the Farmers Market Farmers Market from time to time, and it is also available on http://www.yummydummy.com their website. And at Ikedas

Their company began as a Christmas project, making bars as gifts, and the (as of 2010) 11 to 16 year olds now find themselves with a healthy internet and local business.  They donated 100% of their profit to children and environmental charities.

The company closed down in December 2011 with three of the seven girls heading off to college the following fall.  http://www.davisenterprise.com/business/yummydummychocolatecompanyshuttingdown/ This Davis Enterprise article has details.

 They are not a girl scout troupe, but rather a bunch of budding entrepreneurs (I know several of them).  Users/rocksanddirt
 I think her comment was more a joke, but still yeah, we should make sure not to belittle these awesome girls, people need to take them seriously I think. ~Dave

  It was delicious, pretty dark, nice and bitter sweet, they demonstrated the stuff they use to make it, and explained the process; it was both a treat for the taste and thoughts. ~Dave
