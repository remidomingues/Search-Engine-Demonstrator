Yummy Guide has been replaced by Davis Oshio Cafe.

Yummy Guide Cafe is a Hong Kongstyle Chinese Food Chinese restaurant that has locations in Oakland and Sacramento. It opened on November 6, 2006 with a very limited menu.

Formica tables, with paper flowers and hearts all around. Recent Hong Kong movie on flat screen (http://www.lovehkfilm.com/reviews/one_nite_in_mongkok.htm One Nite In Mongkok, feat. Cecilia Cheung Pak Chi). Heck, even the phone has a Cantopop ringtone! More than any Davis restaurant save maybe Old Teahouse, Yummy Guide caters to the Chinese immigrant students.

Menu combines snackoriented and simple Cantonese cuisine (e.g. won ton lo mein) with endearing wiki:WikiPedia:Hong_Kongstyle_Western_cuisine Hong Kong style Western cuisine, strictly from the preJulia Child era (baked spaghetti with seafood in white sauce, curry). Extensive drink menu including the classic Mixed Coffee & Milk Tea. An alternative to the Chinese American food in most local Chinese restaurants, and to the lessthanglowinglyreviewed fare at Old Teahouse.

The location used to house Mr. Chans.

20061108 15:00:10 nbsp I ate here for the first time today. If the Teriyaki Chicken lunch special is any indication, this place is pretty good  the food was simple, but it was plentiful, and fresher than anything I can remember eating at a restaurant. The Coffe/tea hybrid drink was good, too. Users/GeoffJohnson

20061117 19:33:31 nbsp I did not like the teriyaki chicken lunch special.  Frankly i ordered it because the menu was so limmited.  I dont particularly like that dish much, but it was a choice between pork chop, teriyaki chicken or spagetti with meat sauce.  I would not go back until their menu size increases. Users/MattHh

20061208 22:39:41 nbsp I ate here for the 2nd time today, the food is very good, quality wise, better than old tea house. Try their bake chicken with rice dish, its good! They have a very big menu, and the number of dishes matches, if not exceed old tea house. The drinks that they have are catered more towards the cantonese population. However, there are a couple downsides. 1. prices are expensive, REALLY expensive. Seafood udon cost 7.00 including tax in OTH, but 7.99+tax in here, and the ingredients dont deviate much. expect to spend 25$+ if you are going to dinner w/2 ppl.   2. Limited seating like old tea house   3. cramped seating like OTH   4. atmosphere not as great as OTH, but they do have 1 TV.   They come to you and take your orders (which is good, but they expect tips, thats 34 bux rite there, you can get another boba drink somewhere else!)   5. No parking and you will get ticketed by the city cops.      They are pretty friendly. But even tho their quality rite now is better than old tea house, i think that over time, their quality + quantity will dwindle (like that of OTH, their dishes, which are REALLY good when they first started). But overtime, they chose to use cheaper ingredients, etc. So well see, but definitely, FREAKIN EXPENSIVE HERE!!! Users/JamesLi
  2007125 23:21:08 nbsp Its been a year since the parents post above, and I can say their quality hasnt downgraded one bit. Also, they do NOT take your orders where you sit. You simply go up front and order your food, then once its done they call your number and put it out for you. OTH caters the Taiwanese population while YG caters the HK/cantonese group. If you go to any cafe in HK youll pretty much get the same atmosphere, so its all about what you expect before you come in. Its really a whole difference place and is excellent (and authentic) in its own right. Also, how the hell is a big plate of food + drinks for $4.85 expensive?? If paying less than $5 for a lunch + drinks is too much for you then considering bringing your own lunch. Panda Express is way more expensive than this place  its nowhere NEAR anything that resembles Chinese food either. Scroll down all the way below for my review of this place.Users/AnthonyLam
  20061211 23:00:53 nbsp I AM DAMNED EXCITED. Only menu in Davis that Im aware of that features deep fried intestines. For someone who craves Chinese Food similar to some stuff I grew up with, I was overjoyed to see fried intestines on their menu, it made my day. I dont know why the last reviewer complained about parking as the place is located a twominute walk from the Central Park lot. If someone takes your orders and delivers your food they SHOULD get tipped. The food while expensive if youre using The Bay or Asia as a comparison is pretty standard Davis pricing (which isnt great, but not unique to this establishment). And am I the only person that likes OTH (just dont order from certain parts of the menu, duh)? Take this however you will, but I work at Bistro, I like our atmosphere and design but if it was applied to Yummy Guide I would immediately be suspicious of the place. The actual design of the restaurant is familiar to me, a complete lack of desire or Westernized design that pretty much sums up the restaurants I see in Taiwan/The Bay anyways. Users/AlvinTsao
   20061212 08:14:51 nbsp Youre right, it is close to the MU parking struture. But during the day, if you have a car, no parking permit, are everyone willing to pay at the meters and then walk to the place? ppl are lazy, so they would want to park on the street, but since daytime, there are parking cops around, ppl usually get discouraged (not all, just saying some). Also, I for one like OTH too, so I am just comparing. Like i said, the design of the place, is kinda halfassed, the lights are nice, but then the whole place....just doesnt click , at least not yet, the all white wallpaper, etc just ..... :(  Pricewise, i would still say its expensive. Ppl say OTH is expensive, wait till they try here. even though food are really good (for now), priceswise, i think this place takes the place of If you have money and would like a lil upscale OTH, go here kinda restaurant Users/JamesLi
    20061213 15:04:58 nbsp I dont want this to be a back and forth thing, but I was talking about The Central Park Parking Lot and other street parking (that does not require permits) if you only stay for a certain period of time. Ive tried two of their lunch specials so far, Fried Pork Chop with Sliced Onions and The Curry Pork Chop, and recommend the latter. The lunch specials are a decent deal as you get a good portion of the entree plus rice plus a drink. Not exactly 4 star Chinese Food, but really pretty decent for the price and portion size (plus the convenient location for the Young/Wellman set). For those with wireless, the location is close enough to campus where you can piggyback of moobilenet.  Users/AlvinTsao

20070101 16:17:50 nbsp i had this fried chicken with some weird sauce ontop of it that gave me a huge stomach ache. its pretty expensive but its understandable if its considered a HK style western restaurant (gangshi xican). its nont terrible, but ive had better.  Users/EmilyTung

20070127 01:10:59 nbsp This place is really popular and packed everytime I go there. Ive enjoyed the cuttlefish soup and the eel on rice. The fish cake udon noodles were pretty good, but it was far too greasy and the fish cake doesnt at all mix with the sauce. The teriyaki chicken is bonein and has skin, which gives the meat a lot more flavor than your typical teriyaki chicken. I sampled one of the chicken with rice dishes. The sauce tasted identical to Knorrbrand browngravy mix. The dish was huge and the flavors were pretty overwhelming its best suited to being split amongst a few people. Definitely dont get the kidneys even for kidneys, they were way too dry and rubbery. Users/CraigBrozinsky

20070127 10:23:53 nbsp Pretty cheap Hong Kong style food since lunch comes with a drink and a meal. No veggies though, so all you health freaks stay away! Users/AtyNguyen

20070128 04:51:34 nbsp I eat here for lunch whenever I can, the prices are cheap (BBQ pork or S&S pork with rice and a drink for less than $4, beats out Teriyaki Express by a landslide), the food is good, its pretty close to MU/Freeborn, and the cashier is cute. :) Users/DaiNguyen

20070209 00:35:45 nbsp The people who thought this place is good has obviously never had good Chinese food. I had dinner there today, and I had to make a profile here to comment on how disgusting it was. Right now I actually have a stomach ache from the shrimp dumplins  I ordered. I tried my friends dishes too (Sweet and Sour pork and Pork ribs) and was not impressed at all. Eat here if you want to have the worst chinese food possible at davis. At least Mr. Chans food never made me this sick, literally. Users/JoeXie

20070211 17:00:05 nbsp Get the salt and pepper chicken wings for appetizer! I absolutely love it! Users/KiwiSelina

20070401 13:01:13 nbsp we tried this place a couple weeks after it opened, i dont think we will ever go near there again. it was really really bad tasting...i hope other have a better experience... Users/GarrettGallegos

20070411 21:32:27 nbsp The food there is pretty good, its OK for Chinese food. Kinda expensive for the amount they give you. Plus its not really anything hella SPECIAL for the price.  Users/jes

20070423 16:32:37 nbsp food.....not that great... Users/JamesLi

20070423 17:05:40 nbsp i usually go with the shrimp wonton noodle soup. i havent tried anything else here (the soup is decent). if you are looking to spend 510$ on a meal this is a pretty good buy. you will have to wait 10 minutes or so while they cook your food, but you can watch TV in the meantime. Users/HuiChen

20070502 16:29:48 nbsp Being from Southern California where cities like Rowland Heights, Monterey Park, and Alhambra exist, Ive been jaded by stupid cheap and extremely good Chinese food. While the lunch specials arent too bad in terms of price and taste (I had a bowl of mustard greens with pork in broth with rice noodles), that $2.25 menu I feel is a complete rip off. The same day I had the lunch special, I ordered some curry fish balls. For $2.25 I was expecting at least the entire pack of fish balls (which generally has anywhere between 12 and 16 pieces), but instead, I got six. What the heck! I can get a package of frozen fish balls at SF market in Sacramento for $0.99! My girlfriend ordered a plate of fried chicken wings with french fries and a ham and egg sandwich. All far too little food for $2.25. Go in for the lunch specials because you get a pretty large portion, a drink, and the price is fair. If youre tight on money, stay away from the $2.25 menu because youre going to end up paying at least $10 just to get full.  Users/VincentShin

20070517 18:48:15 nbsp The Mango Pudding is Fing good!!!!! Users/CatLa

20070622 20:21:27 nbsp I eat here a lot.  Its expensive, but I enjoy several of the items.  If you are ever in Oaklands Chinatown, go to the Yummy Guide therethe pig ear is quite good (and different from the excellent pig ear at Hometown).  The Sacramento one (near SCC) is fine, too.  Why Ive eaten at every Yummy Guide is a long and exciting story. Users/MisterProfessor

20070908 15:49:05 nbsp The food here best reflects the hong kong cafe style dishes and appetizers/snacks. Although a bit pricey, it doesnt stop me from coming back Users/KaiWan

20071012 23:25:14 nbsp I did not like their teriyaki chicken, but perhaps it was because it was Hong Kong style and I was expecting something else.  The teriyaki sauce was really sweet and the chicken was deep fried.  It was not very high quality food, but ill come again and try something else. Users/ingrid

20071025 10:18:57 nbsp I went to try this place for lunch, it wasnt bad, reminds me of a much better woknroll, it was pretty delicious, for five bucks the lunch special was decent, definitely worth a second visit. On a second visit this place is delicious, definitely a nice replacement for the now departed wok n roll though a tad more expensive, it is less so than old teahouse for lunch, as far as I can tell. Users/DavidPoole

20071102 00:28:50 nbsp I just ate here for the first time today; got their steamed siu mai and spicy chicken with rice. The siu mai was soso...I didnt really find their sweet sauce appetizing. Their spicy chicken and rice was okay, too. The sauce that came with it was too sweet in my opinion, and the chicken was not spicy enough. From what I had today, I wont be going here again for Chinese food anytime soon; Ill just wait for my mommy to cook me up some. :) But their milk tea was pretty good. Users/kthrnngo

20071111 11:12:19 nbsp Worst restaurant of Davis. Never come here unless you like eating garbage. Everything here is low quality from the sweet n sour chicken, spaghetti, or thai style chicken steak. Typical platter consists of one overcooked piece of broccoli as garnish, pile of rice, and small portion of bad tasting meat.  Users/chuendogg

20071113 08:24:31 nbsp went here at 10:30am on a weekday. There were people there but the door was locked. I knocked and got no response, it seemed as though they were intentionally ignoring me. One of my pet peeves is when businesses do not open on time. Users/MattHh

20071205 04:19:58 nbsp Ive been here since last year and HIGHLY recommend it  Every friend (about a dozen) that I bring to this place loved it and returned regularly for more. If you love the same old, tediously UNAUTHENTIC sweet n sour, orange chicken, wok n roll shit (panda express or great wall anyone? ANY fusion place) then this is NOT the place for you. If you wanna get a taste of a truly authentic Hong Kong style cafe (this coming from someone whos lived in HK for half a decade), youll love this place. If youre expecting Taiwanese food with typical Jay Chou or David Taos music in the background, head over to OTH... Hong Kong and Taiwan arent even the same damn places on the map (I love OTH too, dont get me wrong) so dont compare the two. So if you dont mind the rush hours and a relatively crowded place, go for their lunch and dinner specials. Theyre lunch/dinner specials change WEEKELY, NOT daily from my experience. What they have on the special menu is most often pretty good. If youre not so sure which one to get, go for #1 with lemon iced tea. You probably wont go wrong with that. Also, if you order things from the menu solely based on reading the translated English, sooner or later youll run into a dish that surprises you  not just in this place but in any Chinese restaurant. If you cant read Chinese, bring a friend with you that does and youll see the difference. FOR INSTANCE, see that picture of the menu above? Look at the LUNCH SPECIAL section, and compare #1 to #4. If you dont read Chinese youll think theyre both Chicken. If youre familiar with Chinese youll IMMEDIATELY know that #1 is chicken STEAK and #4 is just chicken (nuggets). Without knowing that in Chinese youd have no clue that one is a steak (chop) while the other isnt. IMO, none of the translated English do the menu items justice. Finally, they have 2 other locations  one in Oakland and the other in Sacramento. Davis, being their 3rd location in the BAY AREA, is the livingproof of their quality and consistency. Highly recommended. Users/AnthonyLam

20071207 18:00:08 nbsp Dim sum aint worth s. Microscopic frozen siu mai wouldnt even be worth $.50. Asked how many come with the order, six sounded fine, but I was surprised those itty bitty frozen shitlings on my plate. Girl was very rude, defensive when I commented on this. Not so good, maybe Ill try once more Users/TheStomach

    Well, I see your point, but if you eat dim sum often like I do, youd know not to try dim sum anywhere else other than in the Bay Area or LA. If you want REAL dim sum go to S.F... Fook Yuen in Milbrae is good and VERY popular, so is May Flower in S.F., 27th and Geary. Highly recommended. A few other places serve dim sum, but DAVIS??? A college town? for crying out Im thankful theres an HK style cafe, we might be the only UC with it. Its like asking for sashimi in a Chinese restaurant. Dim Sum dont really belong to HK Style cafes but this one is an exception, Ive never seen another place like this. Having said that my point is you gotta take all that into consideration. Honestly I wouldnt fault them for giving you frozen shitlings cause well, thats exactly what Id expect. Hang out with chinese ppl more in the bay and youll know the real meaning of dim sum. Whats more, Ive never seen an HK cafe serve dim sum. Real dim sum are meant for a gathering of family and relatives, spending 2+ hours around a table chatting and catching up. Go to milbrae or S.F. for that. I sincerely hope you wont find this offensive as I was just trying to make a general point. There are so many people like you that think of dim sum as STRICTLY FOOD. Almost like orange chicken. Research what dim sum REALLY means and youll see my point.

20071220 18:11:41 nbsp Is this place the same as Oshio Cafe owned by Young S. Oh (20071119)? Users/SteveDavison

     No, this place is called Yummy Guide. It USED to be Mr. Chans (Chinese) fastfood nearly 2 years ago. Whats Ohsio Cafe? Users/AnthonyLam
      UPDATE (1/7/08): OK YES, apparently if Im correct, yummy guide is CLOSED and a new place called Oshio (like you said) is opening up. Its a wine and bar place according to them.

20080504 21:04:57 nbsp does anyone know why Yummy Guide closed down? I thought they were a successful business  Users/justinhu
