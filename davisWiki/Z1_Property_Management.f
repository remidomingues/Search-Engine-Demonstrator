Users/loribergum

20120702 00:10:39 nbsp Were fortunate to have Raul managing 2 properties for a partnership my sisters and I formed a few months ago.

20120716 20:47:38 nbsp Raul has been awesome, working hard to find a high quality renter and taking care of all the little things that come up. Hes made our transition to being landlords pretty painless and has been a great liaison between ourselves and our tenant. Id recommend him to anybody thinking about renting out their house.
 Users/DavidFeliz

20120827 17:21:48 nbsp Raul took over my lease this year from another leasing agency in town. He stood up for us when it was time to get our security deposit back and the old leasing agency endorsed charging us for items we had noted were damaged or missing in our house for the walk in. I was very impressed with his integrity and professionalism. Shortly after he took over the lease we had a water based cooling system on our roof leak and he had it dealt with immediately. If youre tired of the large housing agencies that dont remember or care who their individual tenants are and are slowed down in everything that they do by their bureaucratic nature, then I recommend Z1 properties because having a professional oneonone relationship with your renter can take care of so many problems that otherwise crop up when the relationship is completely onesided and the agency doesnt view the tenants as actual people.  Users/MichaelSteinman

20120922 19:45:41 nbsp Raul managed our lease while at Dowling Properties and when he started his own leasing agency, Z1 Properties.  Not only is he easy to communicate with, he was helpful and friendly.  Raul handled all issues regarding the lease, rent, and the security deposit professionally and diligently.  When we had an issue with the property, Raul negotiated a repair with the owners, despite the maintenance not being included in the lease.  He maintained good relationships with his tenants and I would recommend Z1 Properties for any tenant or homeowner looking to rent their property.  Users/LeahWilke

20121016 04:15:38 nbsp Raul ,like many others it seems, was the manager of my property during his tenure at Dowling Properties.  I encouraged him to utilize his talents to benefit himself directly.  I was one of the properties that was shovel readied to another leasing agent when Dan decided to loosen his load a bit.  I recently terminated my contract with the agent that I was handed off to and sought out Raul due in large part to the great service I received while in his care at the previously mentioned property management firm.  Rauls customer service has always been and continues to be, customer oriented, whether representing the Owner or Tenant.  I recommend his services without reservation.

20130309 18:10:52 nbsp Raul is an excellent and incredibly responsive property manager. He has been nothing but helpful in the time that I have known him. He even answered a latenight repair emergency at the house I am renting  something that other property managers and landlords Ive had in the past did not do. Raul is by far the best property manager I have dealt with, and I strongly recommend him to both renters and those looking for a reliable, trustworthy property manager. Users/jialei

20130515 14:29:32 nbsp Raul was recommended to us by a friend when we were in a transition of relocation. We were in need to lease our property in Davis. Raul helped us went through the transition very peacefully. His rich experience and knowledge on porperty management really impressed us. He made the process on leasing our property so easy and efficient. Our property was cleaned and leased within a month at great price! We are very happy to work with him. We strongly recommend Raul if anyone needs a property manager. Users/LisaWang

20130528 15:35:25 nbsp Raul has managed a rental property for us for about two years now. Weve been very happy with his service. Hes responded quickly to any questions weve had, forwards to us any inquiries and repair requests made by the tenant, and makes sure those inquiries and requests are addressed quickly. We highly recommend him to anyone looking for a property manager. Paul Michelson   Users/PaulMichelson

20130818 18:39:09 nbsp I came to know Raul out of Chaos and the hidden war that is Davis property management and real estate. In other words the owners of the condo my family and I were renting fired the property management company that we were renting through and hired Raul. Upon is unexpected phone call he also informed us that the owners had decided to sell the condo! We went from happy family to OMG what is going to happen to us in the space of one day. That being said Raul really came to bat for us. He made sure that prospective buyers respected our privacy (I am a stay at home mama with a toddler) and showed the property only on my schedule. We had a lease but living in a rental to be sold is pure HELL, so we asked to be let free of our lease a YEAR early. Again Raul came to bat for us and pulled strings not only to get us out of the lease but to help us find a new and better house in the same price range. He even drove over a truck full of free packing boxes for me because  have a small car. We moved into an awesome new place, the old condo sold in under 4 weeks and we are happily settling into our new home. Raul you rock! Thank you soooooo much for all of your hard work...!  Users/MayaHopkins

20131220 17:34:14 nbsp We interviewed several property managers when our property became available to rent. Raul Zamora from Z1 Properties was the last property manager we interviewed and we knew instantly he was the right person for the job.  He is professional, experienced, trustworthy, and incredibly easy to work with.  He communicates well between the owner and the renter so that a great working relationship can develop.  He was able to rent our property in 3 days. We would highly recommend Raul Zamora from Z1 Property to be your property manager whether you are renting a property or looking for a property to rent.  Users/LucyAsai

20140708 10:56:50 nbsp After two years of working with Raul, first as my landlord and then as my real estate agent as a first time home buyer, I couldnt recommend him more highly.

First, on the property management front.  My wife and I lived in a duplex he managed for about the past two years, and it was a great experience.  Raul works closely with both the tenant and the owner to work out a reasonable lease.  You should be aware that his client is the property owner; he is responsible to the owner, and it is clear that he takes that relationship seriously.  That said, he was great about negotiating our requests with the owners of our duplex, including talking them into allowing first a cat, then a dog in the propertysomething the owners were reluctant to do.  Obviously, your mileage may vary; its up to the owner to ultimately decide what to allow.  He also negotiated a better movein time for us, with a prorated discount on the first months rent.

Raul is also always available and very responsive to any significant maintenance and repair issues that may arise.  Hes got a very knowledgeable group of contractors and whatnot that he works with, and they make time to handle all requests he sends their way promptly.  Theyre very good at working around a tenants schedule as needed, even when theyre on other jobs.

You should be aware that if youre used to living in an apartment complex with onsite maintenance staff, renting a house or duplex is a different experience.  There isnt someone wandering around the property 40 hours a week at your beck and call.  If you look at reviews for some of the other property managers in town, or at the California Tenants Handbook, youll see that its common for issues to take days or weeks to get resolvedbut not so with Raul.  The few times we had any significant concern, he had somebody out to look at the place the next day.

Second, theres the real estate front.  Raul is an independent real estate broker, and we chose him to represent us in our hunt for our first home.  Raul was always available, and he has a strong sense of the Davis (and Woodland, although we werent looking there) real estate market.  He had plenty of recommendations for us and worked within our budget.  There was no pressure (including when looking at houses where he represented the seller), just lots of support at all times.  Whenever we wanted to go see a house, he made it happen immediately, working around our schedulesnights, weekends, whatever worked for us, he made himself available.

There was also a major perk to working with Raul as both landlord and real estate agent: he lined up a new renter for our old place promptly, getting us out of our lease a month and a half early, which saved us a substantial amount.

Raul also referred us to Marc Thompson  Mortgage Planner, who was incredibly helpful to us in nailing down our budget, planning, and ultimately securing a mortgage on favorable terms.

All in all, I highly recommend Raul from the perspective of both a renter and a home buyer.  And while I dont have firsthand experience on the other end, I expect that if we end up selling or renting out our house down the line, Raul will be our first call for a property manager or real estate agent.

20140716 16:48:49 nbsp Z1 Property is the best! Raul is very professional and easy to work with. Their properties are very well managed and reasonably priced. Highly recommended! A++++ Users/AndyTan

20140801 05:16:37 nbsp My husband and I had the pleasure of being a tenant of Rauls for the last two years. We had nothing but positive interactions with him as a property manager, he was sincere, friendly, and timely with responses. In our experience, he exhibited a high level of professional integrity as he strived to serve both the tenant and property owners equally, representing both of their best interests. Minda and Mike Cavill Users/MindaCavill

20140820 00:52:29 nbsp Raul was the property manager for my mothers rental house in Davis and then handled the houses sale after 2 years. It was a real pleasure working with Raul because he is so professional yet personable, takes pride in work very well done, and is quite knowledgeable about both the rental and real estate markets in town.  He is very responsible and responsive, and will be there to take a phone call at almost any time, or get back asap to messages.  Rauls team at Z1 are all highly competent and a pleasure to work with. He is also well connected to a network of trusted tradesmen who can provide bids and/or be hired for repairs and remodeling. As our real estate agent, Raul was exceptional.  There was very little that we (me and my stepsister who lives in Florida) had to do beyond keep up with the paperwork (which was made easy through DocuSign). The whole process of selling the house was quick and efficient and surprisingly painless. Most important of all, Raul is an exceptionally nice guy with a great sense of humor and this made working with him a lot of fun. I could not recommend Raul and Z1 highly enough. They are a welcome addition to Davis. Users/KateScow
