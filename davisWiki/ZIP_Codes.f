Davis zip code boundaries were realigned on July 1^st^, 2006. Previously, only El Macero used 95618.  Some computer databases that generate direct mail seem to still have the 95618 zip code as being only for El Macero, and it is not uncommon for Davisites in this area code to receive mail addressed to their street address but the incorrect town name.  However, the postal carriers seem to understand this, and you will generally still get your mail even if the town name is incorrect.
