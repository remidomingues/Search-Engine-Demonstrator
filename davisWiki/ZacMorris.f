Im just another random computer geek who loves riding motorcycles and his girlfriend Lucia.  I now live in San Francisco along with every other unoriginal Davis grad.  Also, I really like sandwiches.  Mmmmmm sandwiches.

I try to live my life according to the great ODB:br
Just dance! if you caught up in the holy ghost trancebr
If you stop! ima put the killer ants in your pants

That may or may not be me bending over for IDB.

20080314 17:37:42 nbsp Hey, I restored the comment on Stonegate Self Storage, as Ive seen the guy there abuse customers to tears (literally) and loudly verbally abuse his wife in an office full of people (Im guessing she is his wife).  I really wish I had not given them business, but I was dropping the truck off.  We went to Penske for later moves.  The comment may (or may not) be exaggerated, but it very sadly seems to fit into my experiences.  If you want to call it into question, feel free. Users/JabberWokky
