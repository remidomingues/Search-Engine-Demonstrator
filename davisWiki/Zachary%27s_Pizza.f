Although Zacharys is located in the Bay Area, it is often worth driving all the way to the Oakland and back. Zacharys serves Chicago Style Pizza, and is quite possibly the best pizza this side of the Mississippi. Anyone looking to make this Adventures Outside of Davis adventure/homage should be sure to call beforehand to place your order  this can be difficult as the phone lines are often tied up.

You can order the pizza half baked if youre not planning on eating it immediately. However, this is a difficult temptation to resist.

At the College Avenue location, there is a Trader Joes located across the street... like the Davis Trader Joes, its parking lot is usually completely full.  This leaves College Avenue and its tributaries as the only parking options.

All stores are employeeowned and operated.

 Directions 

If youre a student and you want to go down for a late lunch, take the Davis Berkeley Shuttle at 2:15 from Shields Library. When you get to Berkeley, walk a block or so down (west) University Ave. and hang a Left (south) on Shattuck Ave. Get on a BART train heading towards San Francisco or Fremont. Get off at MacArthur (two stops), go under the station and move to the next platform where you will catch a Pittusbug/Bay Point train. Get off at Rockridge (one stop). Walk two blocks (north) up College Ave. Eat. Do the whole BART thing in reverse to make it back to the shuttle by 6:30.

For the one on Solano, turn Right (north) on Shattuck Ave. instead, and wait at a bus stop for the 43 bus.  A few minutes after getting on the bus, you will go through a tunnel.  Get off at the first traffic light after the tunnel, and Zacharys is on the next block on your right.  If you cant get the bus to stop in time, walk back a block.

How do they compare to Uno? Users/JevanGray Jevan
   I think they are better.  The original unos in Chicago is killer, but I have never liked the satellite branches for some reason.  Users/RogerCLark Roger
    Uno is dog food compared to Zacharys, in my opinion.  Ok, that was harsh, I like Zacharys better.  Users/rocksanddirt


20060611 13:23:52 nbsp I went here over the weekend and tried their deep dish pizza (chicken basil) for the first time.  I have to say, it was excellent.  The sauce was fantastic, very tomatoey without being too oily.  The cheese was light and the chicken was almost nonexistant.  But overall, very very good pizza.  Probably the best Ive had in the area.  It ate just as well the next day. Users/AlexPomeranz

20060612 08:14:49 nbsp I went here two weekends ago.  I would rate the pizza as nothing special.  Flavorless, oily cheese and sauce from a can.  Its on par with Steves or Cenarios.  The novelty of a stuffed pizza may be worth the drive, or the time spent waiting in line for some, but I dont ever need to go back there. Users/NikolaiBraun

20060719 15:34:28 nbsp Although Im a FAT SLICE fan and have been known to go to Berkeley just for a slice, Zacharys is too good to miss.  Users/CatStarr

20060809 01:48:09 nbsp I was in berkley visiting some buddies a few weeks ago.  They introduced me to this place and I must say, it gives symposium a run for its money for my favorite pizza place.  Its good quality pizza, the service you get is fantastic, and the lines arent outrageous.  It is also amazing the next day for lunch.  Great artichoke hearts too, good times. Users/OlinHannum

20061220 13:57:47 nbsp The spinach & mushroom pizza is the best anywhere, including the original Unos in Chicago (which is much better than any of the franchises). Users/ScottWeintraub

20070725 14:01:08 nbsp Any time were in the bay area we eat here.  Excellent!! Users/Davidlm

20080705 14:04:21 nbsp This page has no relevance to Davis, tasty as their pizza may be. Users/MaryLieth

20100425 22:26:22 nbsp Both the one in Oakland (Rockridge) and in Berekely (Solano) are so good. Being from Oakland/Berekely, Zacharys is the thing I miss most about the Bay Area....well get back to me in August when it is 100 degrees here and 85 there, then yes. Users/BryceH

20111205 16:03:15 nbsp Pizza nirvana.  Really a California interpretation of Chicago style pizza... unlike traditional deep dish, Zacharys tastes fresh, not too heavy or greasy.  Definitely worth the drive, and worth the wait. Users/OldDavis73
