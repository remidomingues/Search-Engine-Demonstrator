My hypothesis: (a) the wiki:WikiPedia:Scoville_scale Scoville scale of Davis’ restaurants is on the lower end of the piquancy spectrum and (b) their spice complexity forced into an equilibrated state of collective mediocrity. The reason, I believe, is caused by the 50% student population and the raw economic constraints they impose. How, you ask? Well, it’s rather simple, really: the student population at Davis, on the whole, has been raised with minimal exposure to (a) wiki:WikiPedia:Capsicum capsicum and (b) spices common in foreign foodssuch as Thailand, India, and Mexicorendering their taste buds squeamish, weak, and unrefined. This phenomenon, I suspect, ties in with the bourgeoisification of America on some primal level, as well as the general blandness of average American home cooking (salt, pepper, thyme, rosemary, etc., are all common and, unless used in gourmet cooking, patently bland). The consequence of the Davis populations bland pallet is that restaurants must (a) savagely curtail their piquancy levels and (b) spice complexity to maintain regular patronization. The cooks, therefore, may be inculpable, but the studentswell, Ill leave that judgement up to you. (It occurred to me that the food commentary doubles as an extended metaphor for decadent culture in generalha! Were all in the Village! Watch out!)

Parodic Autobiography of Prince Vogelfrei
Im considered baseborn, despite being a descendant of the King of Ireland (or so my father tells mebut then again, all Irish folkor I should say, more technically, all people who regard themselves as suchthink themselves descendant from royalty, and if you go far back enough, its inevitably true). By saying this my intentions should not be confused: I dont resent being baseborn, for it does not mean I am base. Golden children come from bronze parents, after all. And in this regard, I was fortunate to have golden parents, of a sort (character, though not class). Nor does being baseborn entail suffering from wiki:WikiPedia:Ressentiment ressentimentor does it? Perhaps someday, if I make a name for myself in academia (pardon my perhaps unfounded egooptimism), Ill look back and say, All my frustrations were expressions of ressentiment, after all, because now that I have extrinsic, institutionalized power, I no longer know the feeling of oppressionmy feelings before were all imagined. But are imagined thought contents and their attendant emotions any less real? I feel, therefore I think. Selfmade (or happenstance) liberties do not free us from imagining the very real bonds of others: we can imagine their oppression, empathize with their suffering, their intrinsic ability and potential, despite their being baseborn. We can also imagine and see a lack of all these good qualities in othersthis we should not forget, though I repeatedly do, as a sort of dispositional default. My dog is my pain. Weltschmerz is his name. So someday (maybe), as I suggested, Ill make a name (for myself?) and talk about these things in a scholarly journal or book where people will actually care about what I say enough to influence others in accordance with my teachings (that is, the teachings of all who come to the same point). Or maybe (more likely) Ill make a name for myself without extrinsic recognition, in which case Ill live a very real though selfdeluded life, and Ill pontificate away the days, expounding on my own theories about ressentiment and fictional foundational emotions. Then everyone will point at me and say, Theres a bronze man thinking hes golden. Though my delusions will be real enough for me (or not). Quando etiam sapientibus gloriae cupido novissima excuitur.

New caution. — Let’s stop thinking so much about punishing, reproaching, and improving!
We rarely change an individual; and should we succeed, something else may have been
accomplished, unnoticed: we may have been changed through him! Let’s rather make sure
our own influence on all that is to come balances and outweighs his influence! Let’s not
struggle in a direct flight, which is what reproaching, punishing, and desiring to improve
amount to. Let’s rather raise ourselves that much higher. Let us give our own example ever
more brilliant colours! Let us darken the others through our light! No—let’s not become
darker on their account, like those who punish and are dissatisfied! Let’s sooner step aside!
Let us look away!

to dominate life. The ‘objects’ have progressively grown in vigor and intelligence, in size and beauty—while
man, who created them, has more and more become a cog in his own machine. Perhaps there is no point

. . . Take stock of those around you and you will see them wandering about
lost through life, like sleepwalkers in the midst of their good or evil
fortune, without the slightest suspicion of what is happening to them. You
will hear them talk in precise terms about themselves and their surroundings,
which would seem to point to them having ideas on the matter. But start to
analyze those ideas and you will find that they hardly reflect in any way the
reality to which they appear to refer, and if you go deeper you will discover
that there is not even an attempt to adjust the ideas to this reality. Quite
the contrary: through these notions the individual is trying to cut off any
personal vision of reality, of his own very life. For life is at the start of
a chaos in which one is lost. The individual suspects this, but he is
frightened at finding himself facetoface with this terrible reality, and
tries to cover it over with a curtain of fantasy, where everything is clear.
It does not worry him that his ideas are not true, he uses them as trenches
for the defense of his existence, as scarecrows to frighten away reality.
	The man with a clear head is the man who frees himself from those
fantastic ideas and looks life in the face, realizes that everything in it
is problematic, and feels himself lost. As this is the simple truth  that
to live is to feel oneself lost  he who accepts it has already begun to
find himself, to be on firm ground. Instinctively, as do the shipwrecked,
he will look around for something to which to cling, and that tragic, ruthless
glance, absolutely sincere, because it is a question of his salvation, will
cause him to bring order into the chaos of his life. These are the only
genuine ideas; the ideas of the shipwrecked. All the rest is rhetoric,
posturing, farce. He who does not really feel oneself lost, is lost without
remission; that is to say, he never finds himself, never comes up against
his own reality.

Fundamental idea of a commercial culture. — Today one can see coming into
existence the culture of a society which commerce is as much the soul as
personal contest was with the ancient Greeks and as war, victory, and justice
were for the Romans. The man engaged in commerce understands how to appraise
everything without having made it, and to appraise it according to the needs of
the consumer, not according to his own needs; ‘who and how many will consume
this?’ is his question of questions. This type of appraisal he often applies
instinctively and all the time: he applies it to everything, and thus also to
the productions of the arts and sciences, of thinkers, scholars, artisans,
statesman, peoples and parties, of the entire age: in regard to everything that
is made he inquires after supply and demand in order to determine the value of
a thing in his own eyes. This becomes the character of an entire culture,
thought through in the minutest and subtlest detail and imprinted in every will
in every faculty: it is this of which you men of the coming century will be proud:
if the profits of the commercial class are right to give it into your possession!
But I have little faith in these profits. Credat Judaeus Apella—in the words
of Horace.

It is true that to offer political rights, or safeguards against
intervention by the State, to men who are halfnaked, illiterate,

of it? Without adequate conditions for the use of freedom, what is the
value of freedom? . . . The Egyptian peasant needs clothes or medicine
before, and more than, personal liberty, but the minimum freedom that
he needs today, and the greater degree of freedom that he may need

In Memory
The title of this section, In Memory, is a target of contention in George Carlins last http://www.youtube.com/watch?vaRCKoT1HY3U skit, so I think it’s appropriately named. His last act was about death—not an easy thing to make light of. Its success as a truly comedic act, despite its darkly subject, helps ease the passage of a great comedian. Carlin combined two often contradictory qualities: he was both a percipient satirist and a warmhearted, authentic individual. His sardonic cynicism was always inexplicably counterpoised by warm lightness. Ill most remember Carlin for his fearlessness in the face of the status quo. He never wavered. I like to think he knew what was coming, and so he faced his greatest fear by making fun of it.


20051011 00:04:47 nbsp Yeah, since my Arrival in Davis, Ive also noticed that the Generals Chicken is uniformly bland, no Indian restaurant borders on hot, and the Thai restaurants barely tango with taste. If youd like your taste buds to be Living in Harmony, Id recommend you convince servers that Its Your Funeral, and clearly state the A, B, and Cs of your own spice tolerance. For those restaurants that have A Change of Mind, youll have Many Happy Returns. For the restaurants that simply placate your requests, Id like to see the Fall Out on the wiki where, as you know, commentary is always a Free For All. BTW, make sure to preview your edits before saving them youre resaves on Thai Recipes Numbered 6! Users/CraigBrozinsky

  You should know that I do preview my posts, but oftentimes I return to change them. Not only this, but firstreadings (even second, third, and fourth readings) tend to overlook little mistakes, of which I am prone. Im no Bertrand Russell. My first attempts dont come out right. Thus, I will likely always produce multiple resaves, as you call them; but to me, I call them signs of fastidiousness, not carelessness. How are they intrinsically bad, after all? Ill try to listen to your answer with an open mind, but I must admit, thus far your advice sounds frighteningly arbitrary and conformist coming from a fellow admirer of The Prisoner. Have you forgotten its themes?

  The Doctor: He cant do as he likes.

  No.2: Hes an individualand theyre always trying.

 Who knows, perhaps your posts could use a few resaves. (And I say this with cordiality, since I’m sure you’re a nice, bright personits a bit of light raillery that Im sure you can appreciate.) I will try to use the preview mode more often for your sake, if you convince me I should.

  Regarding the advice about restaurants, I have doubts about the power of a single critical comment, situated in this town and dealing with the context we speak of, having any influence on business as usual. After all, if my hypothesis (above) is marginally correct, no number of comments can alter the reality that half of Davis population will always be composed of students with Americanized taste, a population thats always afresh with inexperience. We could, perhaps, start a “Coalition for a Sapid Society,” but I haven’t time for such trifles. I’ll stick to cooking, thank you very much )

20051011 09:07:18 nbsp Sadly, I agree that the likelihood of Davis restaurants uniformly changing the spicyness level is roughly zero. I was more suggesting that you ask them to personalize the spiciness of your dish. This is always a reasonable request in a restaurant whos selling out to accomodate American tastes. Its funny i told you to preview i accidentally clicked the submit button in the middle of typing this! Anyway, previewing is good because it limits the number of changes in the history. Last time I checked, the viewable history is limited to the last 100 changes. Fewer saves therefore allows for more snooping into a pages history.  Also, youd be helping out people with Chronic Recent Changes Syndrome, a minor form of OCD where WikiGnomes feel obligated to check every change made to the Wiki. As for my movie site, Id love to have you aboard! Let me know when youve come up with 5 or so films, and Ill give you an account. As for New Canton, Ive never been there. Well, thats a half truth the half hour wait this past Sunday was unappealing, so I went to Pancake Circus instead. Users/CraigBrozinsky
  The history limit should be increased, then. Are you sure the limit isnt associated with changes made to individual pages, and not resaves? Ill come up with five flicks as soon as I can.
   All are saved, but not all are displayed.  Soon to be changed^TM^.

20051012 00:53:04 nbsp Maybe town restaurants need to have a scale like this: Mild, Medium, Hot, Thai Hot, Policegrade Pepper Spray Users/PhilipNeustrom
  Am I to assume from this comment that you feel the temperature levels are just fine as they are?  ZN
   Nothing in town has been spicy enough EXCEPT Thai Recipes, in my experiences. I usually order from my housemate, Users/BrianMartinez, so he probably tells them to make it spicy (I order Thai hot from them)? In my opinion, if it were any spicier it would start losing flavor. Compared to all the other thai places in town, its certainly the spiciest!  Users/PhilipNeustrom
  Cool, Ill keep that in mind. Perhaps next time Ill try asking for a 9. I of course disagree about the flavor dampening effect of anything beyond a 4. If it were a true 10, maybebut not 4 (in my opinion, as well). Thanks for the comment! ZN


Frequent editing is good, but multiple, rapidfire resaves are just a bad habit. They clutter up the change log for a page, which makes it harder to track the real evolution of the pages content, rather than someone fixing minor typos, slight rewordings/reformatting, or general brain farts. Then you have to answer the question, Which group of changes really represents that one revision? Also, they force the server to save a copy of every single little change. Use preview and spend some time thinking about what youve written before actually saving. Looking at the revision history of a page and seeing 3+ edits from the same author in less than a minute is just lame. Users/JevanGray Jevan
  I still disagreeits not lame if each edit was made with conscious intent and only after using preview mode. Sometimes I find things that I didnt see before that I can’t just let gothey have to be changed, otherwise the intended meaning will be wrong or a whole sentence may be confused. Im thorough and selfscrutinizing (though ultimately imperfect), and so on final analysis, I wont alter my personality to conform to your, or anyone’s, arbitrary conception of whats lamewhich in this case is little more than a latching on to conformist, unreasoned preconceptions of Davis Wiki etiquette. Being lame is not a substitute for an argument, nor is fulfilling your need to track the true evolution of a page (whatever that is). I will continue to use preview mode as much as possible before posting, but beyond that, I’ve done my part. I wont suppress the urge to change something after a few minutes time just to appease the fulfillment of some fantasy rule, some look at me! Im in the Wiki club! Aint I cool?! whim. And what are the real consequences of resaves, anyway? (Forcing the server to do anything doesnt count.) The bottom line is this: if the only consequence of multiple resaves is pushing other saves out of the history, that’s not my problem; it’s the problem of this Wiki’s kernel. And if thats the only real consequence of resaves, then the truly selfish Wiki contributor is the one who edits the most, since every edit, even if its only one, forces other edits out of the log. But we both know thats not true.

20051013 21:26:44 nbsp arent all of the reports regarding bistro 33 unconfirmed?  and you are not very good at judging character, fyi Users/DisgustedDiner
  Danke for the comment. Yes, but not all of the reports at Bistro 33 are of the same kind; most are food reviews, and a few others are serious assertions about particular individuals, assertions that may impact their reputation and employment. The latter kind of comments, as Im sure youre aware, require greater care and scrutiny than the former. This is why I took a skeptical stance. As for your other remark, all I can say is that, sure, its possible. Sometimes I am a poor judge of character, and other times not. The ecology of human beings is highly complex, and when you have to judge someone by what they write alone, and when his or her writing is in fragments already inflected by a particular online context and format, its exceedingly difficult to be positively right about whats said. Ultimately, then, I must suspend judgement in lieu of some variety of confirmation. One of my favorite mottos is de omnibus dubitandum, doubt everything, and this includes myself. That said, you do realize the irony in your comment, no? You make a positive, general assertion about my personality based on a shred of evidence, and if you are referring to my cautious evaluation of your post, then youre conveniently taking yourself out of the equation. Some call this an example of the wiki:wikipedia:Fundamental_attribution_error fundamental attribution error. What do you think? ZN

How long before less than ethical restaurants start using the wiki to claim finding fingers in their chili? Users/ArlenAbraham
  I understand and appreciate your concern, ArlenI thought of it myself, in fact, when you first posted of the Tazer Incident. I thought, this could be a bogus report made to denigrate B33, and I thought this despite having low opinions of the place and its food. But why did your report, which was not fully substantiated (on the Wiki, at least) remain in full, while anothers of a similar yet more serious nature be removed simply due to the anonymity of the author? My feelings about DisgustedDiner are clear (see above), but censorship of any sort is, in my estimation, just as dangerous as the consequences of a false report; indeed, theyre both acts of a similar naturecensorship removes potentially true information, while anonymous reports add potentially false information. I know the following clause is not true, but I say it as an example: what if youre somehow tied to B33 and want to get rid of a potentially damaging report thats ultimately true? To be sure, until the facts are all in, why do you get to act alone in making the choice to remove the post? and why should you poison the well for anonymous voters? If your deletion was based on information the rest of us are not privy to, information that discredits DisgustedDiners report, then by all means, do tell; otherwise, youre acting on a suspicion alone. Anyway, thanks for responding.
   Im inclined to agree with Arlen with this one. Its not so much the anonymity as the fact that DisgustedDiner is new to the wiki and hasnt established any credibility. Im not trying to treat the wiki like an oldboysclub, but you have to weigh outrageous claims with the credibilty of the speaker. Users/CraigBrozinsky
    Now youre sounding like the Bush administration :) Anyway, I somewhat agreebut no amount of reputation can stand in for the truth. If it did, it would be the common fallacy termed wiki:wikipedia:Argument_from_authority argument from authority.

  Yeah, Im trying to do this nowbut whether it will relate to any particular Davis content is doubtful.

  Unless I suffer from a particular type of anosagnosia, or mindblindness, where Im absolutely incognizant of my ego and its (always already sic nonconscious) motives, then there must be some grain of truth behind my saying I am not pretentious; if I were, I would, according to OEDs definition, either (a) profess or make claim to great merit or importance, esp. when unwarranted or (b) make an exaggerated outward show. Now, I absolutely abjure (a), since by my own definition of great merit or importance I am as yetand likely always will beamong the bottom tenth, but as for (b), I supposeand this is a stretch of the imagination, but I must try to be charitousit could be said that, since I do tend to use hyperbole as a stylistic device, I am, technically, making an exaggerated outward show, if by outward show one means writing in the Davis Wiki. And one is free to make such an accusation, since it has no real implication. I guess what Im saying (and my response is pedantic and verbose, for ironys sake), is that I wouldnt even joke that Im pretentious. But it is a funny thought (somewhat akin to Alfred E. Neumans What, me worry?). ZN

When I talk of spice complexity, I mean to include European standards, like sage, thyme, etc., but alsoand for me more importantlyEastern and South American standards, like cumin seeds, cardamom, coriander seeds, asafetida, lemon grass, Thai ginger, etc., and a variety of chilies (serrano, dried red, etc.) used not only for heat but flavor, all of which are not standard household spices in America, unless you live with an immigrated, traditionalist family. So I would not want to set up a false dichotomy, as you seem to suggest, between European culinary influences and those from the rest of the globe (India, Thailand, Mexico, etc.). My hypothesis is of course silly on some levels, since it applies not only to Davis but potentially anywhere with 50% student populations, making it rather unfalsifiable, so if this is the focus of your criticism, I’ll have to concede; but insofar as Davis restaurants are concerned, I’ve never been to a place where on the whole theyre so collectively mediocre, bland, and mild. Even in towns like Santa Cruz and Berkeley, both of which have large student populations, the Indian and Thai restaurants are much more complex in their spice variety, and their piquancy scales have much more range. So my hypothesiswhich isnt a true hypothesis, in the strict sensenevertheless tries to understand why Davis, in particular, has such comparatively bland offerings. Im assuming it must have something to do with the student population, but more than the population itself, it may have to do with the diversity and background of Davis students. Its a complex problem indeed. Ill make a few ad hoc adjustments to my hypothesis, though, just for fun. ZN
   Since you mention capsicum specifically, it does sound like a lament about the heat level of local foods.  You are, of course, correct that 90% of restaurants (and home cooked meals) are crap... Sturgeons Law states that 90% of everything is crap.  The remaining 10% tends to be (but not always) more expensive, and thus generally not popular among students.  It also still sounds like you are looking for particular foods (Indian and Thai) that are not common in this country simply due to historical influences.  Fewer examples tends to mean less changes for excellence.  If you were looking for good, say... pit barbeque in the area, youre not going to be able to find much, whereas in Georgia, you find four or five on every commercial street, some of which will be good, and a few of which will be great.  Interesting observations; I can tell you have thought about this.  jw
    If Sturgeons Revelation applied to restaurants, there would be no reason to eat out. And again, the implications of my hypothesis are twofold: one dealing with temperature and the other with complexity, although the former certainly overlaps and influences the latter. As for your other comment, which I generally agree with, you should recall that all American food is derivativeeven soul food, which often has Cajun influences (influences that, again, originate outside the US)and so my hypothesis cannot possibly apply only to particular foods that are not common in this country, for its precisely because of such historical influences that we have any variety of cuisine to begin with.

20060209 00:50:38 nbsp ZN, care to recommend any of your favorite literary works to paisans like myself? Users/JohnNapier
  Im not sure what gives you the impression that Im qualified to recommend literature, but Ill give it my best shot. If by literature you mean fiction, the first thing that comes to mind is wiki:WikiPedia:Herman_Hesse Hermann Hesse, if you have not yet read his work. wiki:WikiPedia:The_Glass_Bead_Game The Glass Bead Game is my favorite, but any of his stuff is good. To start, you might want to check out wiki:WikiPedia:Narcissus_and_Goldmund Narcissus and Goldmund. And you can’t go wrong with Shakespeare, of course! Check out his Julius Caesar if you havent already! Its a lesserknown gem. If youd like more recommendations, philosophy or otherwise, let me know. Oh, and by the way, thanks for using the word paisans. Id never heard it before. ZN

20061009 22:30:57 nbsp im sory i disagree with your analysis of the Davis palate.  yes it is much weeker in terms of ability to handle spice even more so than other places in the US.  However, this does not mean they have a unrefined palate.  it would be comparable to say that someone who thought foods were too salty and couldnt handle the salt content of some dishes is unrefined.  But, if you order food extra spicy at shanghai town (tan tan noodles are insanely good) i think you will be pleasantly suprised.  the spicy dumplings are not hot though, go with the string beans and tan tan noodles and say you want it extremely spicy. Users/MattHh
   Thanks for the tip. Ill check it out. ZN

20080212 15:18:44 nbsp Zach, I liked your satirical comment on the Thai Recipes page about juxtaposing masturbation with love. Its so true that beautiful, outspoken people are an anomaly in Davis and have to resort to this. Whenever I do go slumming for soulless sex, I remember why I stopped doing that in the first place. So far in Davis, I havent been able to make a true connection with the opposite sex. My running line is, Everyones so glued to their laptops that they forget life is in front of them.

20080319 20:13:40 nbsp While i think we have butted heads slightly in the past over Romas cleanliness and the spice content of Davis restaurants, I have to say you are right on the money with 3rd and U. I remember saying to myself as i was eating a sandwich, there is no way in hell that i would study here. Ew, its so lowed and uncomfortable. There was like 5 people there when i went, and I could hear every conversation and every dish being cooked. The place also has no personality, the decorations and everything are like SoCal chain healthy fast food chain restaurant. Users/MattHh
  sigh Yeah, I miss the old Roma(s). Whatever happened to the need for environmental character? Even a little seediness is preferable to the sterile, plasticminimalist, Ikea prefab look (for me, at least). I hope the new Mishkas locale maintains its old aesthetic. The wood highlights and chalkboards are endearing. ZN

20080616 15:42:19 nbsp for what its worth, from your posts on the wiki I think your ability to never accept dogma and to always question, I think you would make a great tutor. I think that the Socratic method is actually the best form of tutoring. The more questions i ask them, the more they think. Sometimes the questions have to be a little leading, but i am totally opposed to tutors who just give students the answers and explain them.  Users/MattHh
  Its worth much. I agree with you that Socratic irony is a great educational tool, but I fear that critical thinking has become a lost art. If you mention informal logic or the logical fallacies to anyone outside the philosophy department, for example, youll get wry looks of incredulity, as if you were mouthing some type of conceited gobbledygook. Critical thinking has always had the same implacable enemy under different guises, cynical power, and in todays corporate driven monoculture, this brand of power reigns. (That satirical saying from The Prisoner, A Still Tongue Makes a Happy Life, seems all the more hauntingly apt, no?) Anyway, . . . steps off his virtual soap box Ive grown unhealthily paranoid, so do ignore my excesses. ZN

20080626 08:13:51 nbsp Zachary, I feel for you.  I live out of Moleskines, Rollabinds and have a shelf of composition books that date back many years.  Good luck getting it back.  Did you put contact information in the Reward spot at the front? Users/JabberWokky
  I do in my larger one, but I didnt have any info. in this oneits one of the mini sized Moleskines, so it doesnt have a reward spot. I must have been careless somehow . . . Im thinking it fell out of my pack or pocket or something. ZN

20080724 15:32:43 nbsp What course? I have applied QT to myself, from a book, with better than 90% success (on headaches, muscle aches, muscle fatigue, scratches), so far. If it turns out it doesnt work on anyone else, Ill still use it. It just struck me as so simple others must have tried it, so I was just making an attempt at contacting them. I didnt realize Davis Wikiians were so ferociously against things like it. Oh, and I didnt realize there even was a website! Go figure. Users/Sankofa416
  I should have said class, not coarse. Kaya Yoga has really good restorative sessions, I hear, although I would wait a couple of weeks until the regular teacher comes back, whom I’m told is excellent. Regarding self applied QT—and please don’t take this the wrong way—it seems to me like what you are experiencing is the wiki:WikiPedia:Post_hoc_fallacy post hoc fallacy. We all do this from time to time. It’s a natural byproduct of linear human perception. But many pseudoscientific programs take advantage of the post hoc fallacy as a means of exploiting peoples natural credulity. ZN
     I was inquiring about your advice I take a yoga class instead, as if I were planning to pay someone to initiate me into the world of QT. An altruistic concern for the way I spend my time wont cut it, either. If assuming my thinking is fallacious makes you more comfortable, feel free. I wasnt intending to offend your scientific sensibilities.
      I was suggesting an alternative, but I had nothing in mind about initiation. I am altruistic in this regard.  I don’t get anything in return from making sympathetic recommendations, and you havent offended my scientific sensibilities :) I think you’d be surprised with how philosophically nuanced my thoughts are regarding science and psychology.

  I take your hint. All the same, would you like me to really modify/expand content of the Trolls page? :) Z
  Sorry about that!  The request seriously had no hidden meaning to it, and I only thought of your name because you appear to be someone who takes care about your writing style here.  Anyway, I started to try to rewrite that page to tie it to the larger social issue without killing the obvious humor in the page.  Im afraid I failed at the latter.  Any suggestions?

20090527 15:15:48 nbsp I actually remember the public comments time for the proposed development on the tank house, I think the orange trees would die if they were to be transplanted, but some are better than none eh? Users/StevenDaubert
  It’s complicated. I like Mishkas, and I like the bricked, shaded area around the tank house and especially the trees. How can someone choose between trees and a businesss desire to expand? I don’t think it can be done without bias, although arguments can be made for privileging what’s natural over whats artificial; or in this case, since the desire to expand ones power is natural, privileging whats more natural and lasting. In this case, I wanted not to have to chooseand perhaps that reflects a complicity on my partbut if I were forced to make a choice, I would side with the trees. We’ve grown too out of touch with the consequences of development. Z

  Yeah, sorryI was in a surely mood when I wrote that. In this case I did mean to show my annoyance with your glib comment of at least needing to add a link. My frustration was short lived, though, so no need to concern yourself . . . I dont generalize from one petty thing to the whole of a person and his/her contributions. And as it is, nothing really gets my back up on the wiki anymore, at least not like it used to, some years ago. Now Ive got other things more worth getting frustrated over, so this stuff seems like normal everyday miscommunication type stuff to me . . . nothing to brood over :) So please do delete my hasty post on your page, now that the context has passed and I could care less either way. Z

20090811 19:23:17 nbsp You seem to have a distaste for Avid Readers philosophy section.  If you would like to come in and recommend a few titles, Id love to order them for the store so that others may share in your knowledge.  We are a communitybased independent bookstore for a reason and you wouldnt be the first person to do so. Users/SunjeetBaadkar
  I try to purchase only used books. Occasionally Ill get something new or go browsing a bit, locally, and when I do I make an effort to stop by SBs first and ARs second. I ordered a new copy of Coriolanus from AR not long ago, and when my used copy of the Republic became too ratty, I purchased a new one at AR. These decisions are based on a conscious desire to support local over corporate business, but sadly corporations and marketing strategies run the show at both venues before the books hit the shelf. My purchasing habits, however, are independent from what ought to be generally represented, in terms of literary value, and as far as quality representation is concerned, Borders does a comparatively better job for philosophy and the classics, even though better in this context still means painfully limited. Z

20091205 18:12:41 nbsp Interesting reading my past conversations in an entirely new light. Thanks for your comments and for continuing the conversation. Still learning the ropes around here. Users/Sankofa416
  Agreed. I’m often astonished, after years pass, looking back over my own previously expressed thoughts. Sometimes I feel repelled by earlier beliefs, disappointed in my own narrow perspective at the time, and sometimes I’m gratified to see I was onto something after all, or at least partially. This reminds me of a section from a quote I keep returning to a lot lately: Through knowing ourselves, and regarding our own nature as a moving sphere of moods and opinions, and thus learning to despise ourselves a little, we restore our proper equilibrium with others (F. N., HH, 376). Z
