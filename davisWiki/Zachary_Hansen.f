PLATFORM

Protect Student Money:
Institute a student control board for $15 million in student fees that do to UCD Intercollegiate Athletics

We need more accountability in our ICA department. Student initiative (SSMF, SASI, FACE, and CEI) fees provide the majority of funding for athletics and, as such, we have a right to know how that money is being spent and to hold our administrators accountable.

Bring Back the Brown Bag Lunch:
Put together a monthly lunch with students and our Chancellor

There is a massive disconnect between students and Mrak Hall administrators. To work on this, former Chancellor Vanderhoef would have lunch with the students in the MU. It is time to bring this back and foster a civil, human discussion.

Assist Student Groups with Events:
Help with the logistics and regulation of organizing events at UC Davis.

Anyone who has ever tried to put on an event here knows just how complicated the path is. There are not many better ways to bring our community together, and theres no more challenging way to do it either. Having a little experience and some help goes a long way in cutting through the red tape.
