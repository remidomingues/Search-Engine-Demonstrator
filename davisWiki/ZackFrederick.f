Zack Frederick is a fourthyear English major at UC Davis. He used to work at Freeborn Hall, but traded lifting tables for writing articles and now slaves away for the Arts section of the California Aggie.

He lives in West Davis amongst the trees and fancies himself a sunset aficionado. He bought a big stereo earlier this year and uses it to annoy his neighbors (who watch endless amounts of TV and appear to be quite depressed).

Somewhat musically inclined, he is a member of the band http://www.myspace.com/BabyChampion Baby Champion
