I am a Middle Eastern dance artist living in Davis and would like to bring my passion for this dance to your next wedding, birthday party, or corporate event!  Here is some background on what we regard in the west as “belly dance.”

Belly dance is an ancient art that originated as a fertility dance to prepare womens abdominal muscles for childbirth.  The belly was wellregarded as the sacred seed of life, and with this in mind these movements were passed on from mother to daughter.  Although the original intent of the dance may not be apparent in performances today, a belly dancer still represents this beautiful feminine power subconsciously to her audience.  Thus, she inevitably brings pure joy to anything in life worth celebrating!  Consider Entertainment for Hire hiring a professional belly dancer to make your next event extra special!
