Name: Zak Davis

Office: I work as the Program Director for the Hillel House in Davis.  Before that I was a Sociology major, Spanish minor at UCD.  Throughout my time at Davis, I rowed on the Crew Team, I worked at the Coffee House, I was a brother in the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity, and I sang in the Lounge Lizards, an oncampus a cappella group.

Personality: I like to think Im a good guy.  Feel free to introduce yourself to me at the bars, or at Hillel, or on campus.



Hey, Zac... the verb used in the first AEPi sentence is somewhat odd.  Or at least tantalizing, as it suggests a story.  Why use the term surviving?  It certainly makes me curious to know more, but I dont see anything in the writeup to explain it. Users/JabberWokky jw
