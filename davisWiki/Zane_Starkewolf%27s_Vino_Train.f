The main fundraiser event to support Zane Starkewolfs bid for the U.S. Congress for 2008 was the Vino Train, a private party we held on the Sacramento RiverTrain. We had a great crowd of supporters and friends on the ride and enjoyed the scenic nature and city views along the Sacramento River. We hope to have another, even more successful event, again in two years for the next election, so stay tuned!
