20081026 22:52:08 nbsp Zane also claimed responsibility for a very interesting recorded political phone message I received tonight.  Either that or hes the target of a bad joke in his name.  Anyone else get a vaguely pornographic phone call about Mike Thompson being a very bad boy?  Entertaining I guess, but in pretty poor taste for a political message.  Of course, now I know his name, so I guess it was effective too. Users/EdHenn
