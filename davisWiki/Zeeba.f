I work at UC Davis and moved here in 2008. I used to spend most of my free time fighting for kittens (fostering) and gays (marriage equality). These days I spend all my free time trying to keep my twoyear old from killing herself. I hope that once we pass this phase I will return to volunteering my time for my favorite causes again or catching up on my sleep. I found the wiki useful when I moved here so I am trying my best to contribute to it.
