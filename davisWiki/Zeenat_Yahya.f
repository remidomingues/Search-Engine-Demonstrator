 Candidate Statement 

Hi my fellow Aggies!

My name is ZEENAT YAHYA and I am so excited to be running as your next ASUCD Senator with the NOW Slate.  I am a secondyear Managerial Economics major from Concord, CA in the Bay Area.  My involvement on campus ranges from being an Intern to ASUCD President Carly Sandstrom, an active member of Greek Life, a Campus Tour Guide, and a Chancellor’s Ambassador.

My interest in running is sparked by my love for UC Davis and the desire to have a positive impact on campus. I am running with NOW because I believe that we can advocate for all students and connect students so they feel like they are a part of something bigger than themselves. If elected, I hope to accomplish the following platforms:

UPDATE AND EXPAND DATABASE FOR PURCHASING LECTURE NOTES
Did you know that if you miss a class, you can go online to purchase notes through an ASUCD unit? Classical Notes is an ASUCD unit that hires students to take notes for different classes which can then be purchased online. I want to promote Classical Notes so there are more notetakers, thus providing a larger and more updated database to purchase notes from. I also want to work on marketing Classical Notes so more students know the services they provide. Finally, I want to work with Campus Copies to have more readers available on campus to purchase at affordable prices.

PROMOTE MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS AND ADVOCACY
Here at UC Davis we place a great emphasis on eating healthy and staying fit.  However, I don’t feel that there is enough importance placed on our mental health, especially as we go through a crucial time in our lives.  I want to bring awareness to this issue by having a Mental Health Awareness week during the school year. This would allow students to learn about the various psychological services we have on campus, through CAPS (Counseling and Psychological Services), The House, and the Student Health and Wellness Center.  In addition, I want to work with CAPS to increase the amount of free sessions they offer per student.  Lastly, I want to collaborate with FirstYear Experience to make sure that incoming students have a greater knowledge of the services provided by CAPS in order to ease their transition to college.

I want to be an avenue for all students so they can have their voices heard. Don’t forget to VOTE ZEENAT YAHYA #1 AND NOW #26 for ASUCD SENATE and WONDERS/GHAI for ASUCD President and Vice President on February 18  21 at elections.ucdavis.edu!
