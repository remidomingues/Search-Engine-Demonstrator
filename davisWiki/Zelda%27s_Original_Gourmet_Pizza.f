Zeldas is a Chicago style pizza place in Sacramento, located in Midtown Sacramento midtown.  The pizza has been rated highly in Sacramento News & Review Readers Polls for years, and is quite popular on weekends.  The restaurant itself is old and dark.  It is really just a converted bar.  The lack of windows, dim lighting, and cramped tables attest to this.  The place is a pizza dive in the truest sense.

Tips for ordering:
Call ahead of time and place your order.  When the place is busy this will speed up the service as they can premake the pizza for you and it will be ready soon after you are seated.  When waits at this place can regularly exceed an hour this is a godsend.

Quality of food:
Its great pizza, but for Chicago Style, it is merely OK.  The crust is a little gritty since it uses cornmeal to get the trademark yellow color.


20050609 14:34:26 nbsp I was taken here on a date.  A pizza place, in Sacramento, for a date?  Well, let me just say it was worth it.  You really cant get this kind of pizza in Davis.  Ive never had this sort of pizza before, so consider me uneducated, but I liked how it was, well, sort of inside out! Users/PhilipNeustrom

20050711 19:56:44 nbsp I guess I like California pizza too much. I found Zeldas to be so horrible I only ate half a slice and left the rest of the soup in its pan. If you need a spoon to slop a slice on your plate, youre not eating pizza IMO. So I didnt like it, nor did several others in my company. In the interest of full disclosure, Ive never liked east coast pizza very much. And its not like I had west coast pale imitations, I went to New York last year and ate at http://www.lombardispizza.com/pages/1/index.htm Lombardis.  Users/JesseSingh

20060909 13:17:58 nbsp Chicago style pizza is not East Coast (New York) pizza. For one reason, Chiacgo is not on the east coast. Chicago and New York style pizzas are as close to polar opposites as pizza gets.  Users/JustinLanska

20060909 21:06:39 nbsp Let me tell you: having grown up in Sacramento and eating Zeldas at least once a month, the pizza is a million times better if you get it to go and eat it at home. It is even better cold for breakfast the next morning. I jump for joy on mornings there is Zeldas in the fridge. Users/ElisaHough

20061108 23:23:13 nbsp Having been raised on Zacharys Pizza Zacharys, Ive long wanted to sample Zeldas and compare.  I can now say that Zeldas will do in a pinch, so long as I need a fix and know that I wont be visiting the Bay Area in the next month. The pizza had a good, tangy sauce and there were plenty of toppings. The crust was crisp and smelled buttery when taken from the oven (ordered halfbaked); unfortunately, it had the consistency and bland flavor of a thick pie crust with too much shortening.  This came close to countering, instead of complementing, the toppings and seasonings.  As a side note, Zeldas menu does not offer a stuffed version. . . hence the willingness to hold off a few weeks for Zacharys. Users/KevinChin

20070622 20:16:09 nbsp I have been to Zeldas a few times since the end of the millennium.  Its always been good.  I went earlier this week for lunch, and it was the best pizza I had ever had there.  Perhaps it was because it was less busy, but perhaps its because they improved the pie crust recently.  The nonpizza items are decent.  Its also dark and vaguely seedy.   Users/MisterProfessor

20080404 11:30:58 nbsp I used to live around the corner from Zeldas.  I havent eaten there for a few years, but, as a former Chicagoan (my hometown), I can attest that Zeldas pizza is authentic and good. The best Chicago pizza is better than this, but it is competitive.  The corn meal is part of an authentic Chicago pizza.  Its a matter of taste, but it is far better than NY style in my opinion.  It is heavy and it isnt neat. But it is satisfying.  The atmosphere hasnt changed in many years and yes, it is dark and essentially a bar.  Must be good to have lasted so long. Users/PaulIgasaki
