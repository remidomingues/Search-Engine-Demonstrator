Zero Waste Events started on campus with a program managed by the now defunct R4 Recycling program to reduce landfills waste during oncampus special events by eliminating waste at its Geology source and replacing trash cans with compost and recycling bins. Event Centers, the Custodial Division and Grounds Division now support Zero Waste events on campus.

The City of Davis has a web page devoted to http://recycling.cityofdavis.org/residents/apartments/rentarecyclingcontainer/holdingazerowasteevent  holding a zero waste event. On December 6, 2011, Davis City Council passed a Zero Waste Resolution, setting a new goal for Davis to achieve 75% recycling by 2020 by implementing zero waste strategies. This makes Davis the 1st city in the Sacramento region to adopt such a resolution!  Go Davis! http://archive.cityofdavis.org/meetings/councilpackets/20111206/04A%20SM%20Zero%20Waste.pdf Link to the staff report.

The Campus Center for the Environment also provides some support and materials.

Zero waste events help reduce our dependence on raw natural resources such as trees timber, University of California Oil Forum petroleum, and Geography land. Reducing and diverting any waste generated lessens the Facebook total amount of waste that goes into the UC Davis landfill. By using compost compostable wares, we can compost and recycle everything at events. By providing reusable wares, we cut down on energy used in producing and disposing of nonreusable wares. In the end, you feel great about helping eliminate waste!

Landfills Landfilling Trader Joes organics is a major contributor to global warming. Essence of Davis Methane is released when organics decompose without oxygen (such as in a landfill). By composting organics, you prevent the creation of this potent GHG and instead create a valuable City Council fertilizer that helps plants grow more and sequester even more CO,,2,,. http://www.cool2012.com Zero Waste helps cool the planet.

Also, it is Zero Waste Policy university policy to move toward Zero Waste.
