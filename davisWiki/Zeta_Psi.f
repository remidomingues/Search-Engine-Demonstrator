Zeta Psi is an historic, elite, and intimate brotherhood. Since 1847 we have taken pride in the caliber of schools we are at and the quality of men we invite to join. Zeta Psi is established at the best schools in the United States and Canada, and from them, recruits the finest of men — leaders, scholars, athletes, and philanthropists. It is possible to find brothers wearing letters on the street who you’ve never met and have an instant friend and a great conversation — because each brother cares deeply about being a Zete and the brotherhood.

A uniquely valuable sense of community stems from our intimate size and elite style that groups with 100, 200 or more chapters—at any campus that requests membership—can’t match. That sense of real brotherhood is very important to us, and it’s why we have such involved, lifelong alumni. There was an active chapter at UC Davis from 1981 to 1998 called the Iota Delta chapter. The Iota Delta chapter gave us many spectacular alumni, many of which live close by and are excited to help the new colony grow and become prevalent in Davis.

Former presidents include Jordan Chaffin.
