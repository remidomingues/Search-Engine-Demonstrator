Zias Delicatessen is a Sandwiches sandwich shop and Delis deli in Downtown Davis, serving both meat and Vegetarian Options vegetarian options for lunch. Expect to spend around $6 for a sandwich. Zias has some of the best local sandwiches, winning Zias the California Aggie/Best of Davis 07 Aggies Best of Davis award several years in a row. Their sandwiches are predominately cold, but they also offer hot sandwiches such as panini and a meatball sandwich. If youre not worried about dripping, they are happy to give you extra sauce. They also carry specialty condiments, like tomato paste in a squeeze bottle.

They are planning on opening a location in Sacramento in late November 2012.

Zias is quite simply the best sandwich in Davis, if not in all of the Sacramento Valley. Zias, however, does not cater much in the way to typical American views of sandwiches. What you might expect to find at a New York deli or mom and pop sandwich shop is not something you will necessarily find here.

Zias specializes in sandwiches with Italian flavors and ingredients, with a particular focus on cured meats, a variety of cheeses, and simple but effective toppings. Zias Sandwich Shop also sells a number of Italian and Greek appetizers that are not available anywhere else in Davis. Try the stuffed grape leaves (filled with rice), or if youre feeling rich, give the stuffed cherry peppers a try (theyre stuffed with cured meat and covered in olive oil). Zias offers the only true allinone Italian delicatessen experience youll find outside of San Francisco.

Additionally, Zias will place any topping you so desire on a sandwich (including special cheeses, meats, and other toppings) and bill you piecemeal for the extra ingredients. There are truly, then, an unlimited number of possible sandwiches which one could devise. The bread at Zias is also worthy of high praise, it is generally very soft and perfectly suited for all of their sandwiches. Their choice of mineral waters and gelato (both packed and scooped), along with the salads/snacks, can make for a delicious, rich, and filling meal. Of course, the price of these items very quickly adds up if you have a huge appetite; dont go to Zias expecting to spend less than $8 per person unless youre getting just a sandwich.

They accept cash and credit cards, but there is an Credit Card minimum purchase arbitrary minimum for credit purchases. Depending on customer traffic, your 99 cent item, or humidity index, you may or may not be charged.

Zias sells a few Italian grocery items.  Some are expensive due to being special imports; however, other items (such as polenta) are far cheaper here than other Grocery Stores grocery stores.

Zias has added a now popular gelato stand; it is one of a few places offering it in Davis.

Zias is mentioned in The Motive, a novel by bestselling Davis Noteworthy Published Authors author John Lescroart.

20080129 02:57:05 nbsp I am one of those people who find Zias overrated, but to be fair I have only been there a few times. Im rather unimpressed so far though.  Users/JakeJames

20080215 18:11:47 nbsp Not cheap, but I love the Viareggio! Never been disappointed.   Users/jglovicz

20080226 17:56:28 nbsp their meatball sandwiches AMAZING...Ive been looking for a sandwich like this since moving to Davis! Users/drozelle

20080226 20:18:01 nbsp Ive only had the chance to eat here once, but the sandwich I ordered was really really good.  Definitely recommended. Users/IDoNotExist

20080303 11:38:50 nbsp i absolutely love their sandwiches. the gentlemen (owner?) is always nice and makes the visit special. my only negative comment (minor) is one female employee always looks like shes having a hard time smiling LOL.....her attitude doesnt take away from the food tho! Users/michaelG

20080303 13:36:31 nbsp The Toscana is hands down the best Salami sandwhich I have ever had.  So simple but my goodness the meat is cut paper thin and the taste is out of this world.  At least twice a month my girlfriend and I go there to satisfying this craving.  Have tried some other sandwiches for but us the Toscana is the reason to go there.  Super nice folks at the counter, efficient and they seem to listen well to special requests if you make them. Users/loneshark

20080404 00:31:53 nbsp I dont get it! Ive consistently found sandwiches from Zias to be overpriced and disappointing. Dry turkey, too much bread, sad tomatoes... its really not worth it. For this price you can build yourself one hell of a sandwich at Nugget. At least the mozzarella is good. Users/BrianLum

20080517 16:47:02 nbsp I ate here a couple times last summer, and I had the same experience as the previous person and others. The Lucca sandwich was dry and quite tasteless mostly due to the massive, not very good roll they used. I usually prefer oil and vinegar on sandwiches instead of mayo, but I was not a fan of the vinegar they used here. Maybe I didnt try to the right sandwich, and I would be willing to give the place another shot, but I still cant imagine liking it better than my other favorite sandwich spots in Davis, like the Mustard Seed and Nugget. Users/SRB

20080517 16:49:00 nbsp Ive now eaten here a bunch of times.  Definitely yummy food.  Highly recommended. Users/IDoNotExist

20080601 00:27:30 nbsp omigosh. the paninis here are AMAZING. i think i had a turkey one? im not even sure, i just asked about a good one and she said something about red bell pepper paste, foccacia, turkey, cheese, and some mixed greens, i think. i forget, really, but it was amaazing. Users/Esther

20080701 11:39:23 nbsp I go there at least once a week and love the Viareggio the pesto mayo is delicious as are all the other things Ive ordered. I especially love the roatating Gelato selection. Always worth the walk and wait. Users/JamesLDownie

20080717 10:25:46 nbsp We ordered several sandwiches the day before for a work function, as we had in the past. We ended up needing to cancel one persons order due to illness a couple hours before the pickup time and they refused!! They said that they had already made the sandwiches hours ahead yuck! The owner was very aggressive about his refusal to take off the one sandwich. I spent years working in restaurants and cafes and that is a really good way to lose customers. It certaintly permanently lost the business of everyone in our office, and future catering orders. For the cost of one sandwich they lost thousands of dollars in future business. Bad move guys!  Users/Karik

  Making a sandwich a few hours ahead of time isnt that bad; the premade sandwiches sold at grocery stores and minimarts are often made a day or two before they are purchased. Furthermore, you probably ordered your sandwiches for a lunchtime meeting; lunches at Zias are pretty hectic, and Ive waited in line longer than 20 minutes for a sandwich there before. I doubt they would have time during the rush hour lunch to make a bunch of sandwiches for a catering event; making them a few hours ahead of time means they have better service for the lunch crowd and you still get your yummy sandwiches relatively fresh.  Users/ElleWeber

20080906 13:33:54 nbsp Viareggio is awesome, veggie options are great too.  Never experienced the $10 minimum.  Great staff and the owner (the old guy) is really nice, always tip! Users/shraken

20080925 13:16:56 nbsp sounds like Karik was just having a bad day in general, or is just a bad customer. I have been going to this place since college, and my wife and I drive from Sacramento each Saturday to have lunch at Zias. The prices are amazing compared to places in Sacramento and the sandwiches are even better than Corti Brothers. I suggest ordering a livorno and add a few slices of parma prosciutto to it. Easily the best place to get a sandwich in the area.  Users/sacfood

20080926 14:49:29 nbsp I use them often for lunchtime catering; the food is always delicious (the pasta always gets raves!), they are happy to provide vegetarian sandwiches with wonderful fresh mozzarella, and they areperhaps most importantlyrocksolid dependable.  After dealing with several flaky caterers over the years, I am happy to keep coming back to Zias for their consistent professionalism and reliability. Users/AMcAdow

20080926 16:17:39 nbsp Just went to lunch here and ordered the Viareggio on wheat, with a small side of their basic pasta salad and a coke.  I can quite happily say that I was very satisfied.  The price may have been more than I cared for, but the food was quite lovely.  You can really tell the freshness of the food items in the taste. Users/SunjeetBaadkar

20080928 18:10:33 nbsp ZIAS IS THE BEST!!!! get the viaregio!! and man that meatball sandwich is good...everytime im outta town i miss it... Users/liamcalfy

20081028 16:55:13 nbsp Overrated.  It is by no means a bad place to eat, but I would rather spend my money elsewhere.  I bought a gelato, which was very expensive for the amount I received, and a Viareggio, also expensive, because of all the strong recommendations from this site.  I was very disappointed with the way my sandwich turned out.  It was very plain and dry.  I couldnt taste anything but bread.  Maybe the guy behind the counter screwed up while making my sandwich.     Users/BenLee

20081106 21:51:15 nbsp Ive always walked by this place and thought to myself, This place will pillage my wallet. Looks good though. Users/thelonepiper555

20081110 23:25:40 nbsp Why is this the best sandwich in town? Could such bland sandwich shop really be the best? The prices are pretty expensive, and nothing about my sandwich really wowed me (it was a Zias, youd think a sandwich named after the joint would be better...but honestly the frittata was soggy and gross and the sandwich overall was...for lack of a more descriptive word...blegh). My advice? Go to the coho...you cant taste a difference. Aree Rating: 4.5/10.  Users/ArianeMetz

20090102 15:26:41 nbsp I go to Zias all the time and never have cash and Ive never heard anything about a 10.00 min purchase. Thats odd. Users/Miranda

20090318 21:08:05 nbsp Their sandwiches are worth their cost!  They are DEEEEEEELLISSSH and probably the best sandwich Ive ever had in Davis.  The service is good too :) Users/renee415

20090410 10:39:26 nbsp Love this place a little tooooo much.  Really cute people work here. Users/strawberry

20090521 14:02:31 nbsp curiosity got the better of me. I also tried this place for the first time, seeing how people like to eat and relax here. I ordered zias sandwhich and yes it was like how ariana described it. soggy and disappointing. I was hoping the fritata would taste somewhat more italian. I saw that they have corned beef but they have no sandwhich that utilizes it. The Lucca was okay. The sandwiches here are sandwiches anybody can make using the same amount of time with ingredients that are simple to get. its not worth your time or money here.

Also, you can order your sandwhich on wheat? I was not given that option. just a roll or slice. ughhhh, not coming back here again. Users/chand3123k

20090724 15:58:31 nbsp Their sandwhichs are great. I love the soft, fresh bread. The Lucca and Pisa are good options! Users/ces139

20090807 15:41:46 nbsp really enjoy coming here, getting a sandwich and bottled coke and sitting outside. It may be slow, but when you cut the accessories and take care making something, thats usually what happens. Its not a fast food joint. thank you zias staff. Users/patrick82

20090811 19:25:55 nbsp Zias is quite simply the best sandwich in Davis, if not in all of the Sacramento Valley. Zias, however, does not cater much in the way to typical American views of sandwiches.

My personal favorite is the Livorno, which is fresh mozzarella, fresh basil leaves, olive oil and vinegar, and tomatoes on a roll. I substitute pepperocinis for the tomatoes to the give the sandwich a very vinegary, salted taste to contrast the milkiness of the fresh mozzarella and liberally added basil leaves.

Zias definitely is a 5 out of 5 eating experience. Users/RDRIII

20091105 16:44:02 nbsp They make amazing meatball subs. Im willing ride my bike from north davis just to pick one up for lunch, so trust me, its good. Also, if you like Italian coldcuts, their hot coppa is good too.  Users/nqbui89

20091213 00:29:37 nbsp this minium thing needs cleared up
I work there
theres a FIVE dollar minium for debit
but well give you slack your first time

PS get the roast pork Users/shambler
    It used to be $10, but any minimum at all isnt allowed...(see: Credit Card Minimum Purchase).

20100204 14:23:29 nbsp Zias only seems good because there arent really any other delis in Davis.  Too much attitude, cookies brought in from New Jersey (why? Arent there good local bakeries that can make black and white cookies?), meat is from Sams club (seriouslynot what Id consider high quality). The Livorno and Viareggio are good but Im over the attitude I get at this place.  Definitely not all its made out to be.  Why is it so hard to get a turkey sandwich made from a fresh roasted Turkey rather than pressed meat?  That to me would be a real deli sandwich. Users/shelanagig

20100206 13:50:49 nbsp Great chocolate cheesecake! Users/eipp

20100331 00:19:57 nbsp Hands down, best damn sandwiches in town. Users/tneeley

20100424 22:17:12 nbsp I love their delciious turkey subs. So good!!! Half of the reason I go to the UCD Baseball games is to win a free coupon to this place. The sandwhiches here are amazing.  Users/BryceH

20100605 02:01:06 nbsp Zias is the best, I was a diehard fan of the Lucca but have recently converted to the Viareggio... So good,  A friend just turned me on to the moz/tomatoe salad and now Im hooked.  Great Sandwich, killer bread and good service. Yum  Users/krissyp

20100725 01:10:27 nbsp Best sandwiches Ive ever had. The Lucca or Viareggio have never let me down. Plus, the service is super nice. Users/AnhthuDo

20100811 11:51:34 nbsp I love Zias. Fantastic food and it isnt everyday stuff. Its a little more expensive, not necessarily bang for buck, but totally worth it. They have two young women behind the counter though that arent all that nice. Some days they are really nice, but there have been a few days theyve been really snippy and Ive had to repeat my order like five times because they dont listen. They had some major attitude with my gf one day I didnt appreciate. The rest of the staff and owners are really nice though. Users/aggie2009

20100819 11:17:44 nbsp I have been coming here quite a bit recently. I do not know what they put in their roast beef sandwiches, but I cant stop eating them. Their sandwiches are a few dollars more than what you would pay at Subway or the sort, but I feel the quality makes up for it. Unlike most sandwich places, they dont rely heavily on the mayo or ranch dressing for flavor. What I like best is that the sandwiches do not fill you up to the point that it affects your cardio in a negative way or leave you hungry to the point where it affects your heavy lifting in a negative way. Users/hankim

20101006 17:39:45 nbsp I recently saw the owner of Zias Deli buying a large load of pre made food including a whole bunch of Prego pasta sauce at Sams Club in Vacaville.  Very disappointing. Users/ACA
 Are you under the impression that most restaurants and delis make their sauces from scratch? Many buy (or have delivered) basics and then season them to their own specifications.
  The irony here is that Zias also has a small Italian grocery section with upscale products.  If they were going to use a premade sauce, youd expect something a little fancier than Prego.   That said, the evidence is circumstantial.  Perhaps the owner was doing something else with the sauce (dont ask me what, but its possible).  Users/CovertProfessor

20101006 20:39:57 nbsp I regularly used Zias to bring a couple platters of 1/2 sandwiches (variety of meats or veggie) and mac salad to meetings I was in charge of they were always great!  I need to host another meeting.... Users/RichardL

20101008 09:24:11 nbsp I am not under the impression that most restaurants or delis make all of their sauce from scratch. Zias styles itself a authentic Italian Deli, I would expect better than Prego its still crap, how about starting with canned tomatoes (that would be basic, not much harder, and better).  Prego is full of high fructose corn syrup and MSG.  no thanks. Also Sams club is a big box retailer owned by Walmart.  Considering how much the Davis Downtown Business association complains about competition from big box retailers youd think that their members would look elsewhere for their raw materials.  There are plenty of wholesale only suppliers for restaurants. Users/ACA

20101111 16:38:06 nbsp Zias is great.  Good place for a nice sandwich and assorted supporting items.  Only small negative is that it gets a line out the dang door around lunchtime, so its best to hit it during nonpeak times. Users/Flokkenfisch

20110110 12:41:04 nbsp If you guys made cannoli and sold Stella DOro cookies, I wouldnt have to go to the Italian market in midtown anymore.  I have to agree with whoever posted above about the Prego.  I had a meatball sub today and it didnt do it for me.  Marinara is VERY easy to make in large quantities, so it would be nice if you made it from scratch.  You could even put it in jars and sell it in the store.  Other than that though, your sandwiches are great. Users/Jibbajaba

20110114 13:47:42 nbsp I love Zias and everybody I have introduced Zias loves it too. My favorite sandwiches are the Meatball Sub and The Viareggio. Around noon the line gets crazy long and you have to wait forever, so I normally hit it up around 11 or after the lunch rush. The staff is always friendly and kind and I am never disappointed when I get a sandwich from here.  Users/JYuki

20110720 11:47:22 nbsp Zias is truly the best sandwich place here in Davis! However, the customer service fails. I called to order a pick up at 11:30 and they refused to take my order. She even said we arent all that busy right now, so you are more than welcome to come by and place an order. They are not very friendly even when you visit the store. Make sure you call no later 11:29 if you want to place your order over the phone! I would probably eat at Zias a lot more often if they stepped up their customer service skills. I am not asking for them to make me feel special, but normal/common courtesy would be nice.  Users/StephanieArreola
  It even says no phone orders accepted after 11:30 on this page. Users/hankim

20111230 17:23:34 nbsp Best Sandwiches in Davis by a long shot. Anyone that says that it is not very good is crazy. My favorite is Ham on a roll with everything. Users/JamesB

20120130 00:07:46 nbsp After like 6 years of living in davis, Ive finally tried this place. What a let down. There was nothing exciting about the sandwiches I had here. Overhyped like fat face. Points for being closed on Sunday though.  Users/CarlosOverstreet

20120229 20:57:44 nbsp awesome food, awesome Staff, people will say its a bit high on the pricing end(i disagree, if you drive a car/have a ULock,  you can surely afford food in Davis), but it is THE BEST sandwich shop in DAVIS.  Users/ndah100

20120520 15:32:47 nbsp Hands down, Zias makes the best sandwiches in Davis. I stopped by for lunch the other day and placed an order just before the lunch crowd extended out the door. My girlfriend had the Lucca and I had the ham and mozzarella panini on rosemary bread. Both sandwiches were hefty and flavored just right with oil and vinegar. We also ordered a serving of the asiago pasta salad and the cherry tomatoes and mozzarella appetizer on the side. The pasta salad was deliciously cheesy and the cherry tomatoes were sweet and tasty under the drizzle of vinegar and oil. We managed to enjoy a delicious lunch that was large enough to provide leftovers for $20not bad at all. Users/AlexHirsch

20121019 11:32:57 nbsp Delicious sandwiches! Users/Trena

20121128 17:45:59 nbsp Zias is simply not a good sandwich shop. They are overpriced and overrated, no matter what your definition of a sandwich is.

Their meats are not very good, which is sad for a shop priding themselves on traditional Italian sandwiches.

The bread was disappointing as well.

The sandwiches are hit or miss. Sometimes too salty, sometimes soggy, sometimes dry as a bone, sometimes actually good.

Overall 3/10. Try it for yourself, though. If you really have that much money to spend, you might as well give them a shot. Users/hobobot

20121130 13:52:59 nbsp Zias has become our goto place for sandwiches in Davis, rivaled only by Cloud Forest (and as variety is the spice of life, I am happy to patronize both places).  As with many places, sometimes it takes a few tries to find your favorite things.  The Zias frittata is pretty unique and worth a try if youre feeling like something different.  The Romas artichokes are a lively complement to the turkey and provolone.  Love the soft rolls.  Love that they are great about large orders (call ahead) and accepting UCD purchase orders.  The sandwiches are large and a good deal in the $5$6 range.  Still wish that they were open a little bit later in the evenings, but I am happy to see that they added some Sunday hours! Users/CovertProfessor

20121130 16:00:29 nbsp I have never had a disappointing sandwich at Zias. Ive never even had a mediocre sandwich at Zias. Theyre always excellent, and remarkably consistent considering Ive been buying them there intermittently since they opened. And I cant even remember how long ago that was. Outstanding.  Users/DonShor

20130102 09:57:56 nbsp Highly recommend! Just beware of the lunch crowd.  Users/SamuelJensen

20130324 12:39:52 nbsp If you like a light sandwich that wont weigh you down then this is the place.  The ingredients are fresh and the meats are tasty.  Your options are limited in this town and its a definite toss up between Nugget and Zias for best sandwich.  If you are looking for something more hearty with a bit of fat, try the meatball marinara (def. best in town).  The lunch crowd is pretty unbearable as stated.

Have they opened a Sacramento location?  I was eavesdropping on conversation the owner was having and thought I heard this. Users/shraken

20130706 21:19:58 nbsp This may go against everything the city of Davis is about, but in terms of a meatball sandwich, Subways tasted better.  Yes, it was just a meatball sandwich.  No, its expectations did not supersede any I would have had at a large chain store.  And I really thought it would have. Users/DavidBarnum
