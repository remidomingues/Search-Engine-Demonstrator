Located on the second floor of the South Silo, up the stairs from the Silo Bookstore.  It is the common space for the Experimental College and the Graduate Student Association.  

It is fairly quiet during the year, some people come here to sleeping on campus nap.  However, Friday mornings are usually busy due to free bagels and doughnuts from the GSA.
