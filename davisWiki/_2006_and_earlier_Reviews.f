20050830 19:53:18 nbsp FYI, I work for Aria Communications Users/RyanCastellucci
  I would like to state here for the record that I moved to the bay area in January 2007 and havent been involved with Instaconnect/Aria Communications since that time. Users/RyanCastellucci

20050830 20:52:33 nbsp Signal strength is usualy pretty good, we use 200mW APs with 5.5 dBi antennas instead of the 30mW to 50mW with a 2.2 dBi antenna most SOHO WiFi gear uses. Im in one of the apartments at Brush Creek Apartments in the back next to clubside and I get around 85% signal from one of the APs over there. Users/RyanCastellucci
  Service cuts out approximately 50% of weekends from 6pm Friday to about 9AM Monday.  This works out to over 2 months worth of service per year.  Since they charge you extra for a 10 month plan, you are really paying for 4 extra months worth of service than youre really getting.  Also dont expect service on holidays or during busy exam times.

20050916 11:45:21 nbsp Im not sure how this is cheaper than other broadband options. Ive been paying less for my SBC DSL for more than a year. (I dont even have the option of Instaconnect, Im just trying to include more information. Users/MattCzarnowski
    SBCs DSL prices are hard to beat, but if you include the price of the landline phone too, instaconnect is a bit more competitive.  Users/JevanGray Jevan

20060122 21:28:13 nbsp If you never plan to use a land line, you can get an SBC option that only costs about 4$, making their rates approx 18$/mo at 1yr/contract Users/MichaelGiardina

20060122 21:42:33 nbsp We used to have Instaconnect in Trees Apartments The Trees complex, but it was by most accounts pretty shoddy  eventually management canned them and got wireless service from someone else, throwing in free landlines as well to make it up to us for our suffering. Users/KrisFricke
   How is the new provider working out?  We initialy had some stability issues with our APs there, which were fixed I belive in October or November with a software update.  We were attempting to take care of the speed issues by adding additional bandwidth (usage was higher then expected) when the management decided they didnt want us to provide service there any more.

20061201 17:58:27 nbsp Having worked in the industry myself, I was impressed by the overall installation done by Instaconnect at Le Tournesol Apartments. Users/ChrisThompson
   A professionally installed piece of garbage is still a piece of garbage. Users/Eganio

20061211 18:37:28 nbsp I currently have Instaconnect and have been less than satisfied. They only are available 96, MF so if your internet goes down, dont expect 247 help  you will be lucky if you get help the next business day. If you want help at night, you have to schedule it days in advance. Our service has been spotty all fall and we have been trying to contact the company, but have received no responses for over a month. While I would prefer to support a local company, I also want to get what I am paying for  INTERNET! Users/JennyMoffitt
