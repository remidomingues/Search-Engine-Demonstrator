20080214 00:53:56 nbsp We had a HORRIBLE experience with Instaconnect for the one month that we had it.  The internet was down almost every other day and they had to fix it about 4 times, but every time it was fixed we had something comparable to 56k, at least 56k is consistent, but we were promised minimum of 3M.  Finally after calling for about 2 weeks straight and dealing with their HORRID customer service we were PROMISED a refund (mind you, we recorded all the conversations).  Well, its about 6 months later, our credit money that went to paying Instaconnect is collecting interest and we STILL havent received our refund.  We used to call about every week with promises of being called back or of getting our refund, but weve excepted that its NEVER going to happen unless we file suit, which, what college student can?  RUN AWAY, DO NOT GET INSTACONNECT.  Theyre THIEVES. Users/tuckerm

20080527 18:37:16 nbsp Its so disappointing to say this because I was incredibly impressed with instaconnects service when we first signed up. An outage here and there, but not worse than comcast. Now I have to say its a piece of crap and everyone should think long and hard about whether the lower price is worth the hassle.

I will say Ive found the customer service to be ok, if you can manage to get in touch with them. I dont want to repeat other complaints that are already here (although I share many  ESPECIALLY the outages), but Ill add a new one: When customers are getting logged out multiple times per day (as is happening recently: 2 logouts in 2 hours so far today), the very least an internet company could do is have a login page that works on the first time, every time instead of getting error messages over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.

20080913 20:07:59 nbsp Im currently at the Viking and have had to suffer through this garbage service. 75% of the time, the internet doesnt work. This is actually a better percentage of the time than the customer service live chat purportedly offered by their Online Help Desk is available, which is zero. The signal is incredibly intermittent and weak, leading to the problem of the no internet. Comcast is dropping by on Friday to install their service, and I cannot wait. If you are moving into an apartment with this awful service, have another ISP ready to drop by and install; this service is incredibly lackluster. Users/AlexChiang

20080930 17:12:04 nbsp Slow. So slow. So very very slow.

However the login page is working now. But at this point Id still never recommend instaconnect to anyone.

More fun on 1/29/2009: Instaconnect is so slow at the moment that the DavisWiki front page took 1 minute and 13 seconds to load.
 This could be because of the wiki also, with any database backed website there are more places for slowness than a site with just static files.  Users/NickSchmalenberger

20081209 11:47:25 nbsp Instaconnect is a nightmare.  I am calling for all customers to leave them.  I am calling for the dissolution of the company.  I have never been able to log in.  Recently, the place where I access through one of their ports had them change from a free access point to one that requires a free account.  Elsewhere, in two years of trying I never was able to log into one of their downtown ports.  All the emails I sent to them to ask how to log in went unanswered.  The log in sent me back to the initial page in an endless loop.  Now I was forced to try to use them because of this change, and their page said I was logged in but couldnt connect because my computer wasnt authorized.  It was very unclear how to get the machine authorized, and I think I did it but it still said the same thing.  So I called and this very nice woman tried to help and kept calling me back but never fixed the problem.  They called back and told me to delete my cookies but to no avail.  I called in later and got a guy named Tay, who was helpful at first and said hed delete my account and then I could log in.  I told him I wanted to give him some constructive crticism, that their user interface was about the most userunfriendly I had ever encountered.  Most ever company Ive given advice to seems to appreciate it, but not Tay.  He got real short with me as if Id insulted him personally and hung up on me.  Over the weekend I tried to reregister my account and the interface froze.  When I tried later to log in, the interface said my account was locked out.  I tried later, same thing.  So I called in today and got Tay again, who recognized me and dismissively said Oh, youre the guy with the free account.  Hey, Im just trying to access the internet at my coffee shop of choice.  If you consider free accounts to be for a lowerclass of freeloaders, dont offer free accounts, as your free service has never given me anythingI have never once been able to log on to your socalled free service, and I sure as hell wouldnt give your company money for anything when your promotional service and customer service sucks donkey meat.  So anyway Tay tells me that the locked out comment comes when you try to enter your password too many times, which isnt what I did.  Then he gets really short with me and tells me he hadnt deleted my account so I could recreate it like I thought he had, only that he had requested that it be deleted.  He got really testy that I hadnt picked up on this important difference, you see, I was supposed to know that my account had not actually been deleted, but only that it was in process for deletion.  Do you understand, sir?  Well, I guess I do now.  So I ask when it will be deleted and he tells me he doesnt know so I ask how I will know and he says he could call me.  I said it sounds like I should just set up another account and he starts going blah, blah, blah and I dont know what because when he was done he hung up on me again.  If you want to really piss me off, hang up on me.  So because Im pissed off, Im calling for everyone who pays for instaconnect to stop paying them, and for any places that use them to stop using them, and for anyone who has a hot spot in their business to unplug the port and call them to pick it up.  Its time for the people of Davis to put this sorry ass company out of its own and everyone elses misery.  I will gladly remove this comment when the head of instaconnect calls me to apologize and gets my freeloader account working.  Im in the book. Users/AlanMiller
