Learn about the history of Davis, California!

This website has three main purposes related to Town History Davis history, Davis historic preservation, and the Davis Historical Society.

1. DAVIS HISTORY. The first purpose is to provide information on the history of Davis, California. This information is presented in three ways.

The first way is from the vantage point of Davis history as a whole, as with, for example, population changes from the start to now. These and other history as a whole aspects are reported in Folder 1.1, which is to the left on the sites home page.

The second is to begin to tell the stories of each of the nine periods of Davis history. These beginnings are in folder 1.2 (and in Folders 1.2.0 through 1.2.9 in Folder 1.2), also on the lefthand side of the sites home page.

The third  way is to publish original research on Davis history, which is, at this time, the Papers on Davis History Series produced by the Publications Committee of the Davis Historical Society (Folder 1.3 on the sites home page).

2. DAVIS HISTORIC PRESERVATION. The second purpose is to present information on Davis historic preservation and historical resources ( in Folder 2).

3. THE DAVIS HISTORICAL SOCIETY. The third purpose is to provide a web presence for the Davis Historical Society (DHS). DHS relevant materials are assembled in Folders 3.1 and 3.2.
