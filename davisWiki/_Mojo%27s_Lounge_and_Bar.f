20131116 18:08:49 nbsp Have been here three times with my wife and it just keeps getting better and better.  Service and food has improved with every visit and its just a wonderful evening each time.  Ive reviewed it one Yelp and its definitely one of our favorite places in area.  I dont think I would call it incredibly upscale.  Fresh local ingredients that are prepared extremely well.  Drink menu that is interesting and a good value.  Yelp checkin gets you 15% off your bill which is a great deal.  You can come casual or dressed up.  Sit in the main dinning area or in the more casual bar and enjoy the same food.  Really far better than anything we have in Davis in our opinion.  Kitchen 428, Ficelle, and Preserve located in Woodland and Winters make me sad for the Davis dinning scene.  Users/loneshark
