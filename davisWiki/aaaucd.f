Please reconsider using a group name to edit under, we are a community. Editing under a group name is dehumanizing. Please review http://identitystandards.ucdavis.edu/standards/athletic_marks.html and see how it applies to your usage of the campus athletic mark. CampusCred was just the center of discussion for a similar issue. Users/JasonAller
