20100504 10:12:21 nbsp Members of the FPANC work in Davis to promote resposible financial planning. We are in the process of getting permission to post a Wiki for a local financial planning branch. Users/achase

20100504 11:40:40 nbsp Achase, please be sure to read over the welcome to the wiki/business owner business owner entry and the Wiki Community/For Profit Restrictions page.  The Financial Planning Association of Northern California FPANC page currently reads like an advertisement (its glossy in wiki parlance).  As the business owner welcome explains, the wikis nonprofit status prohibits from promoting businesses.  Business entries need to be informative rather than promotional in nature.  Take a few minutes to look around at other business pages.  B&L Bike Shop is a perfect example of how things should look.  Informative about the services and products, but not promotional.  Thats what the link to the website is for. Users/TomGarberson

 In fact, on looking at your edit history, youve got this page plastered on 12 different wikis.  That smacks of intense advertising.  Id love to see the page fixed up to be appropriate for the wiki.  Fair warning, though: if it isnt, itll probably be deleted as spam. tg

20100511 09:25:40 nbsp Sorry about that, I will edit the FPANC page to be more informative rather than promotional. Then can I wait for approval before editing the other pages? The reason it was posted on so many pages is because FPANC covers a large area. FPANC is a non profit working to promote responsible financial planning. This is the main point I want to get across through the Wiki pages. Users/achase
   You dont need permission.  Everybody can edit everything.  Of course, thats why the warning about it being seen as spam... if people read the new entry as being spam, somebody will likely delete it.  You can edit any entry; so can anybody else. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20100511 10:16:51 nbsp Alright, what do you think of this page? Do you think I should edit the rest of the pages to this? Users/achase
