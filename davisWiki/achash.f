20110531 14:12:07 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki!  It looks like you may be associated with the Arlington Farms management.  Please take a few minutes to read over Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner (which is in the process of being reworked; if you want, have a look at one of the drafts http://daviswiki.org/Welcome_to_the_Wiki/Business_Owner/Talk/Draft_C here or http://daviswiki.org/Welcome_to_the_Wiki/Business_Owner/Talk/Draft_D here... if you have any input on them, it would be very welcome on the Talk page http://daviswiki.org/Welcome_to_the_Wiki/Business_Owner/Talk here!).

The captions you removed were initially written by one user and were restored after you removed them the first time by another user, who wrote I like those caps.  The Wiki is frequently home to quirkiness, as well as to different points of view on exactly how a page should look.  Frankly, those top two pictures on Arlington Farms look freaky.  Im not quite sure how the halo effect got on there, but the color saturation is insane.  Some mention of the fact that the place doesnt actually look like that is warranted.

If you dont like the current captions, you might try writing new ones.  Theres no guarantee someone wont disagree with the change (or come up with a whole new caption), but trying to improve on content is generally seen as better than outright deleting another users contributions.
