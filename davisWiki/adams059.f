20100530 20:50:00 nbsp Howdy, Mr. or Ms. Adams (or is it Adam S.?), and welcome to the wiki!   My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for adding the information about Unity to this community project  feel free to add to any entry on the wiki.  It was created by and for the community.  Everything on the wiki was added by people like you.  One bit of concern is if you have permission to post the cover of that book.  Everything here on the wiki is owned by the community, through Copyrights creative commons.  That means you have to be able to donate it.  If the book or the cover is Public Domain, or you have the rights to donate it to the community, thats fine.  Were a friendly community here, so if you have any questions, just ask.  Once again, welcome to the wiki! Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
