Do not buy/adopt a pet if:

  You plan to dump him/her when you have kids
  You dont intend to take care of him/her when your kids lose interest
  You dont intend to bring him/her with you if/when you move
  You only want a puppy/kitten and not a dog/cat
  You cant meet basic obligations like spay / neuter
  You wont educate yourself as to what you should do to impart good habits
  Youd rather put him/her down than pay large vet bills or refuse to take them to the vet within a reasonable amount of time after an issue presents itself.
  You just want to breed her to sell cute little babies
  You are going to keep him/her outside
  You cant tolerate damage to your belongings
  You plan to dump him/her as soon as you get busy
  You dont want to make your S.O. take allergy meds. (Claritin, Allegra, and Zyrtec are also used to treat pet allergies allowing people allergic to pet dander to own pets.)
  Youre hardly ever home and the animal will be alone most of the time.
  You havent researched the breed to find out what its needs are and to make sure youre committed to fulfilling them.
  Youre buying it for someone else as a surprise without knowing that they really want to take care of a pet at this point in their lives.
  You plan to feed them lowquality, cheap food. (You spend more money on vet bills in the long run when you feed cheap food.  Also, cats cannot be vegetarians.)
