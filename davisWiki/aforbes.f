Hi, Im Andrew, I moved here recently from Indiana to do a Postdoc here at UC Davis.  I like drinking good beer, vegetable gardening, cooking, running, and looking after my 7 month old son.  I also like eating massive piles of Buffalo wings drenched in Blue Cheese dressing, but i havent found a good place to do that here yet.

You know what makes the best wings? a BBQ and some time, when your in Davis you should hit me up and we will have a good wing off in a nearby park! Im more of a fan of spice than blue cheese but we can do multiple batches! Users/StevenDaubert
