If you note, this site is about the town of Davis, and only has content directly relating to Davis.  The links you keep adding dont seem to be for a business based in Davis.

20140606 23:41:49 nbsp This is not my site.  It is a registered nonprofit educational and informational site about Davis, and not only must it be about Davis by community standards, it is also illegal to put commercial advertising here.  Sorry  if your link doesnt have anything to do with Davis, it really cant go here.  I do appreciate your asking and being polite about it.  I wanted to inform you why it was being removed and have a bit of communication.  Best of luck with your business! Users/JabberWokky
