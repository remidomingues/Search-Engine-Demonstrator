20100729 23:15:54 nbsp Hey Albert, Welcome to the Wiki, Ive noticed that the updating and smoothing out of the Davis College Democrats DCD page hasnt quite gone as planned, but Im sure if we work with the community we can reach some good compromises. Because weve posted information on the site, its now a part of the whole, and DCD no longer owns that writing. It might also be helpful to look at the Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner section...
