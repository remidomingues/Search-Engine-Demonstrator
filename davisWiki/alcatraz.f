Hey, if you get stuck, let me know.  I cant edit the events, but I can delete one so you can recreate it. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20110329 09:23:53 nbsp I deleted event and reposted it with the time change. Wasnt sure which photo you wanted, though. I can replace it with another if you send me the link (rightclick, View Image). Also, know anything to add/take away from the DQ one? Users/JoRo
