20090526 16:21:18 nbsp  Welcome to the Wiki. Please read Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner; it will help explain how you can make the wiki a positive experience for you without clashing with established wiki social norms. For instance on the Angel Eye Care & Family Optometry page the link back to the list of optometrists is there to make it easier for people to navigate between different optometrists; removing it would make the wiki less useful.
