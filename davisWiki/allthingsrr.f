20110823 19:51:26 nbsp Welcome to the wiki!  Thank you for the edits that you made to the All Things Right and Relevant page.  It seems as though some things were out of date.  You might want to read Welcome to the wiki/Business Owner, though.  It will help you to understand why I restored the comments that you deleted.  I would also suggest that you close this account and reopen one that is not solely tied to your organization.  The editors of the wiki have come to a consensus that organizational accounts are harmful to the wiki.  (If youre interested, you can read some of the discussion Wiki Community/Organizational accounts here).  We can always use more editors, though, and we would love for you to come back and edit some more pages under an account that can be tied to one specific individual. Users/CovertProfessor
