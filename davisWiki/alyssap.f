Sorry to hear about your experience with that moving company.  Surprisingly written post; if that had been some of my friends I know theyd have been apoplectic. Id file complaints with absolutely anyone/anything that would make a difference, that guy is a huge ass. Users/edwins ES

20090904 21:31:01 nbsp interesting story, best of luck...

agree... it would be horrible if we were objective here on the wiki. It would certainly make it less useful and interesting. I think commenting on a clients chest during a business transaction makes you a bad person to do business with. Thats probably going to be a common opinion among most people, and theres no reason to shy away from stating that. Users/StevenDaubert

20090905 08:12:40 nbsp The guy continues to be a jackass.  Id say thats the best comment against him.  Im sorry you had to be the first person to figure it out for everybody else.  Dont worry about his reply, and dont take it personally. Users/JabberWokky

20090905 16:33:50 nbsp Agreed with JW, this guy sounds like he has major issues... Users/jsbmeb

20101212 23:41:29 nbsp Okay, that moving company, ie Shawn Banks, is TERRIBLE!!!!!!! He is the biggest jerk I have ever met. He hit on me and we briefly even dated, what was I thinking???? Users/MarjaGMorgan


20121017 19:30:58 nbsp Hi  I know it has been a few years since you posed so I hope you are still out there.  Our family made the huge mistake of using this mover and when they never showed up we posted a poor review on Yelp.  2 weeks later we received a lewd email with a link to a website with our family name.  This site has pictures stolen from Facebook of women in our family calling them prostitutes and heroin addicts.  The second site uses our daughters full name as the URL and calls her a prostitute and has pornographic pictures of someone with same hair color as our daughter and claims this is her.  The IP addresses for both these sites is the same as the IP address for University student movers.  We reported to the police and they found a virus on the site also.  We are trying to get a case with the DA.  If you are out there, I would like to have him talk to you so the cyber bully is stopped.  Please let me know if you want to talk about this.  Thanks Users/LouiseBoron
