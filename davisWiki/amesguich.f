20101021 08:48:14 nbsp Is there any reason you needed to use a URL shortener? Its not like were limited to 160 characters here. Hiding the destination of a link is pretty shady, absent some compelling reason to do so. As such, Ive undone your edit where you replaced usable URLs with unnecessary redirects. Users/WilliamLewis

20101021 09:44:17 nbsp If you want short links, you can put them in brackets with display text.  For example, this: {{{http://www.longandmessyurl.com/blah/lol/this/is/a/long/link Description}}} would give you this: http://www.longandmessyurl.com/blah/lol/this/is/a/long/link Description Users/TomGarberson

20101026 15:03:02 nbsp Amesplease do not remove other peoples comments like you did in Banning leafblowers. Thanks Users/PeterBoulay

20101026 20:34:36 nbsp Ames: I understand youre interested in telling people what to do from your opinion on leaf blowing regulations but on the wiki it is considered wrong to edit or remove comments left by others.  You cant regulate here so please stop. Users/OliviaY

20101101 13:55:04 nbsp Cut it out. Seriously. Users/WilliamLewis

20101101 13:58:41 nbsp Hey, I suggested a solution for the Banning leafblowers page on its {{{Banning leafblowers/Talk Talk page}}}.  Many people here object to the Comments macro because it creates the impression that information above the Comments bar is somehow different from that appearing below.  In fact, its all the same sort of information, from the same source: editors on the Davis Wiki.  I agree that we should keep responses out of the For and Against sections, though, for the sake of organization.  See the Talk page I linked, and feel free to add your own suggestions.  For more info on opinions about the comment bar, see Cut that comment bar out. Users/TomGarberson

20101101 16:18:33 nbsp (I have a head cold of epic proportions, so pardon anything here that doesnt make sense)  You seem to misunderstand the nature of the complaints about your moving other peoples points to the bottom of the entry.  Why does your statement get to be at the top, while you keep pushing the viewpoints of others to the bottom?  Perhaps understanding that the same rule of thumb applied evenly results in http://daviswiki.org/Banning_leafblowers?actiondiff&version2155&version1154 an edit like this makes it clear as to why pushing the voices of other people to the bottom of the entry is a problem... why should your voice dominate over all the others around you?  Theres room for everybodys viewpoints, and theres not really such a thing as static text on the wiki.  Content mutates and changes as everybody adds their own views.  Its just the nature of how wikis work. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20101102 02:07:52 nbsp Thanks Tom, I forgot about the wiki textlink feature.

Everyone, No interest in bugging you, I am just moving comments, not deleting. The only thing I parsed was a very offensive comment that I made into garbled symbols. My view on that was no need for personal attacks.

Also, I think that you can start a page expressing an issue. Everyone can comment and add, but butcher what you created to get your point of view heard is not right. An appropriate way of dealing with this is what someone else did which is create arguments against. That way, everyone ads to the side they believe in without damaging others. Its like a sand castle when you were a kid, you dont destroy others castle, but if left there, you may respectfully (important keyword) make an addon.

@Olivia: That is how I felt exactly, that people were editing my text instead of respectfully arguing against in the area destined for that.

I hope I didnt bug anyone too much, honestly, no harm intended. Users/amesguich
