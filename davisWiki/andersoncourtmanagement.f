The phrase For your convenience, this property is located near... may be one of those that is causing the page to get tagged with the advertising macro. It isnt like the property could be located anywhere else and implies that the apartment complex was located there after the conveniences that is it near were already there. It isnt in the same voice that the rest of the wiki is written. When I see it worded that way I start to channel George Carlin. Also the use of titles as usernames is rather depersonalizing and doesnt demonstrate an understanding on the part of the person using one that this is a community wiki. Users/JasonAller

Wiki Community/Organizational accounts Organizational accounts pose several problems, but the core issue is that they detract from a sense of community when one or more people use the name of an organization. This leads to a sense of faceless, impersonal action rather than the actions and statements of a member of the community. As a member of the Davis community, your contributions are very much appreciated, but it would be better if you make them using your name rather then the name of your organization. If you havent read Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner, and Wiki Community/For Profit Restrictions please do so. Users/JasonAller
