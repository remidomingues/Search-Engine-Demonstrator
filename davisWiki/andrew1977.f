Describe Users/andrew1977 here.

I am a huge fan of good food. I am a real estate broker in HOuston, Texas.
However, I dont buy and sell real estate. I lease http://houston1apartments.com. I basically help people find apartments. My services is 100% free too.
I love the Texas Longhorns and think they have the best football team in the Nation.

This Wiki is specific to Davis, California, but in checking Wikispot.org, I see there is a Houston Wiki, housed http://www.thehoustonwiki.com here.  Its not as fully developed as the Davis Wiki (which has been around a lot longer), but theres plenty of room for it to grow.  If youre interested, you can make a page about your leasing website, and yo seem to be a good candidate for adding pages/listings for restaurants, housing areas, etc.  Ask a few pals to join in, and you guys might have a pretty solid Houston based wiki going.
