Welcome to the Wiki.  It looks like things got off to a bit of a rocky start with the 24/7 Taxi Cab Company page.  I realize you probably saw it as fighting fire with fire, after getting attacked by a competitor right off the bat, but its really not appropriate to leave fake reviews about your company.  Every change thats made to every page on the wiki gets recorded and backed up, so anyone can see that youre behind the fake review.  Have a look at the Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner Business Owner Welcome Page for some good information on how to deal with negative reviews and whatnot.  Bruce has also been asked not to engage in attacks of that sort.  It sounds like the community consensus is leaning toward wiping the comments on the page to give it a fresh start.  In the future, if youre concerned about problem edits like the one Bruce left, please bring it up in a Talk page.  You can make a Talk page anywhere on the wiki by clicking the little Talk button that appears at the top of each page.  If you ask your questions or raise your concerns there, people are sure to drop by and check out whats going on.  Again, welcome to the Wiki!Users/TomGarberson
