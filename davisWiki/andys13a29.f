20080215 18:59:32 nbsp Andy  you made a big mistake by not dropping this.  Youre awful quick to threaten with the cops... Im calling your bluff.  If you havent filed charges against me or my friends within a week, Im mailing a copy of everything you said to The Grads owners.  I think theyll be real interested in it all, especially since you threatened me with a fraudulent lawsuit within the scope of your employment in real simple terms that means theyre liable for what you do.

Its too bad youre too much of a chicken to reply to me on The Grads page

Its too bad youre so dumb you dont realize that your deleted Im calling you out will be in the edit history FOREVER as evidence. Users/davisGeek
