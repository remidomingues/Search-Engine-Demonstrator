I just wanted to let you know that I moved your comment from the Talk page to the International House of Pancakes page.  The Talk pages are really just for editors like you to have metadiscussion about the content of a page.  I also really appreciate that you responded to the comments on the IHOP page.  I think its great when business owners can interact with their customers that way.  Users/CovertProfessor
