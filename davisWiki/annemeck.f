Unfortunately, the featured page has been migrating away from the original intent of the featured page function, basically to feature a daviswiki page, rathern than events.  It meant more as a way to encourage greater exploration and creative editing of daviswiki, and less as a way to promote stuff.  Im going to go ahead and revert this featured page back to the Car Free in Davis page, but please comment back to me if you want to talk about it more.  Users/jefftolentino

20130617 14:08:31 nbsp I agree with what JT says here.  The real point of the featured page is to, well, feature a page.  You didnt even link to any Davis Wiki pages, and you linked to an offsite picture.  I realize that people have been using the featured page for other purposes (like announcing events), but as JT says, thats a drift away from the original purpose, and even then, a wiki page was generally featured (linked and bolded).  The Events page is perhaps a better place for what you want. Users/CovertProfessor
