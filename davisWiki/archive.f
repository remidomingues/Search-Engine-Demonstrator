20100825 15:37:02 nbsp Hey Peter, have you seen the Davis Timeline (e.g. 1994)?  I think its a similar idea  so that other index may be redundant.

One of the features we want to build in the new wiki software is the ability to deal with timebased things more easily (and less by hand). Users/PhilipNeustrom

20100825 15:46:57 nbsp Your index does look prettier, but it has a downside: its harder for novice editors to edit.  If you look at the meat of whatyouwouldupdate http://buffalo.wikispot.org/1812?actionedit here and http://daviswiki.org/1996?actionedit here, the one on Davis Wiki is easier to add to (no crazy table markup).  So hopefully in the future this problem will be solved, both with an easier to use editing process and a real structured timeline functionality. Users/PhilipNeustrom

20100825 20:48:17 nbsp well help you out.   nice to have you here. Users/WesP

20100906 12:48:34 nbsp Im not sure the comments on the spca thrift shop page are so inappropriate. I think they are true at least, and so many of the people who work there are volunteers. I dont think its part of some devious plan to put the other thrift shops out of business, it just reflects a justifiable enthusiasm. Its ok to say KTcooper works there too, but I dont see the comments as being much of a problem. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20100914 15:05:26 nbsp I left them there with a reply so that theres an opportunity for outreach and correction, bringing the person into the wiki editing community rather than becoming antagonistic.  I agree that it went over the line, which is why I flagged it in several places for subsequent deletion.  By presenting the issues and allowing the person to have the opportunity to correct them it discourages a me versus them mentality. and allows for a greater opportunity for more positive editing in the future.  This is a closed, real world community, not a site like Wikipedia that pulls in people from all over the world.  Each person in Davis is a valuable voice, even if some have a rocky start.  I can think of at least one major contributor who came in as the center of a nasty episode.

On a different topic, I do really wish you would not imply that the wiki as an institution is legally responsible for the contributions of individuals.  Thats a claim that is potentially hazardous.  If that person gets sued for libel (not slander) for what they post publicly, it is their issue.  It is also very unlikely, as s/he would have to not believe their statement, which would be hard to prove in this case.  I certainly think many people are (to use the phrase) douchebags.  Implying that the whole wiki is responsible for every statement made is not the best idea. Users/JabberWokky

20100914 15:24:24 nbsp Thanks Peter. Nice to meet you. Users/WesP

20100914 15:24:39 nbsp I mean Davis is a closed community, not the wiki.  Closed as in enumerable, not closed as in not allowing outside influence. Users/JabberWokky

20100914 15:28:06 nbsp Regardless of how things might play out in court, tossing the implication around casually is a bad idea, IMO.  Ive had people call me up and scream at me that they were suing the wiki on several occasions.  A bit of careful tact and communication prevents us having to even deal with things on a legal basis. Users/JabberWokky

20100914 15:40:07 nbsp I prefer to think of it as cheerleader, where you cheer for both sides until they are happy.  And I agree... increasing humanity helps.  Thats why I post my address and phone number on my profile; or I have, before I moved and hit the solid block of chaos.  Zip back a couple revisions for the outdated version. Users/JabberWokky

20100914 16:02:01 nbsp Ha!  I should have known you were a member of the cult of fishnets and sequins.  Good to see another member of the midnight crew on the wiki. Users/JabberWokky

20100916 04:56:28 nbsp Heh.  Its been a sentence here and there over the last six years or so.  By the way, its always driven me nuts that the Bufwiki logo is installed incorrectly.  I meant it to be a background logo with a CSS margin of zero and a companion spacer png to be able to overlay holiday graphics.  If youd like, I can help you install it so things line up and arent cropped (the top and bottom) or have blue margins (the left). Users/JabberWokky

20100918 04:26:02 nbsp Ill need to dig it up.  Theres a CSS file I did for somebody else that is what you need.  If you know CSS, its simply flushing the edges of the logo to the browser window.  Right now there is a margin on the left and the top is being cut off.  Im working this morning, but will try to find it for you. Users/JabberWokky

20100921 09:13:42 nbsp Sure.  The next three days are rough for me because Im trying to get a new revision out the door before some executives (and potential clients) leave for Italy.  Ill give you a day window later this week.  If theres a color scheme you would like (does Buffalo have iconic colors?), Id be happy to add that as well, as its the same set of files. Users/JabberWokky

20100928 19:52:49 nbsp I thought he meant provably  as it, that which has been proven wrong. Users/CovertProfessor

20101001 22:53:30 nbsp Yeah, the spelling fix is fine.  Users/MasonMurray

20101004 19:43:33 nbsp Well, I cant speak to the specific incident when you were criticized for moving a picture, but as you can see most of the pages on the wiki have the main picture in the upper right hand corner.  Theres no rule about it, of course, but it makes good use of white space and immediately shows the reader the subject of the page, so I think its good practice. Users/CovertProfessor

20101006 17:54:58 nbsp Actually, thinking about it, index pages for different types of clothes/accessories might be pretty handy to have.  The key would just be putting them together decently so they actually function as index pages, rather than just advertisements. Users/TomGarberson
  Agreed.  Both jeans and bridal, and maybe even prom, might make for good pages.  The question is whether any of us feel like taking on those projects at the moment, because they certainly shouldnt stay as links only to The Wardrobe (so for now, I agree with PBs deletion).   Users/CovertProfessor
  I made contact with The Wardrobe via email to inquire if a Users/PalomaMichelsen worked there. Of course they wouldnt tell me but I expressed professional concern over the spamming last night. I also explained the 501(c) rule where the Wiki is legally prohibited from advertising and is mainly there to document Davis things. PeteB

20101006 18:57:23 nbsp nice gnoming Users/StevenDaubert

20101007 07:38:47 nbsp Davis is REALLY small when it comes to some consumer goods.  For a long long time, you had to leave town to get socks.  Jeans might actually be reasonable.  There are probably more places that sell Frozen Yogurt than jeans. Users/JabberWokky

20101007 10:34:15 nbsp Jeans, shorts, athletic gear, shoes, swimwear, formalwear, businesswear, ... the list goes on.  I think itd be great to have index pages for a wide variety of clothing categories, in part because there are limited shopping options.  For instance, I know there is (was?) a mens store downtown, but I dont know the name.  If I want a new suit, a search for suits doesnt turn anything up (unless I want a suite at a hotel).  Clothing Stores sort of does what I have in mind, but having it broken down further would be awesome.  Boutiques is awfully general.  Having specifics of whats available would be a big improvement.  One way to do that would be to list for each individual store what kind of things they have on that page.  Another would be to crossreference with index pages, so if youre looking for jeans, you can find out exactly which stores have them without having to browse through 30 boutiques individually. Users/TomGarberson

  I think that clothing store for men close. Unless you are not thinking of James Anthony Mens Wear? Users/hankim
  Yes It is in the Departed Businesses list.PeteB

20101007 13:56:06 nbsp Hey Peter, that http://daviswiki.org/Users/MadelineMM user has a profile page on the wikispot, saying that http://wikispot.org/Users/MadelineMM theyre new.   Users/EdWins

20101018 14:25:07 nbsp I really like the listing of number of archived reviews!  Good idea... I should hunt around for the stuff Ive archived and do the same. Users/TomGarberson

20101018 16:38:16 nbsp Hey, a couple questions regarding the archiving: Are you archiving strictly by date, or are you going through and extracting the information from the reviews, splitting out the reviews from the adding information via the comment macro additions?  Keep in mind that when the calendar year rule of thumb was created, there was discussion that it should just be a guideline overruled by the need of the entry  if there are only a few reviews, leaving them, no matter how old, makes the entry more helpful than archiving them would. Which of course, is trumped by the universal wiki law: them that does it gets their way if no other folk object.  ;) Users/JabberWokky

20101018 19:39:03 nbsp It appears the gentleman we talked to today was not Reneng then.  He had identified himself as somebody who posted comments on our page, but I was not able to get his username because he was in with the manager.  It sounded like his issues were identical to Renengs and he expressed his apologies from misdirecting his frustrations.  I would appreciate you contacting the office or myself about mistakes like this before taking these matters into your own hands.  Richard (Allegre) Users/AllegreApartments

20101019 13:15:39 nbsp Oh, its certainly true that its bad policy for the wiki.  Im being hypocritical due to a morbid sense of curiosity. Users/TomGarberson

20101019 13:15:50 nbsp Frivolous legal threats stifle contributions, and thats why were so against them. In this case, the frivolous legal threats are made against a licensed attorney who not only isnt put off by them, but is quite amused by them. Users/WilliamLewis

20101019 13:41:50 nbsp All the comments are in the edit history if theyre needed. Whats the point of restoring them? Users/WilliamLewis
	    Very hard to weed through them with the different edits that have been done. Users/PeterBoulay

20101019 13:43:43 nbsp To date only four people have been banned in the past six years, and it generally requires fairly heavy community consensus.  Locked entries and short term cool down bans do occur, but it is generally better to work together to calm the situation down.  One method to accomplish that goal may be simply backing off and letting things calm down.  The comments are there, in the history, and will be there tomorrow or the next day... or next week.  They arent going anywhere, and they are accessible  and able to be restored  at any time. Users/JabberWokky

20101020 16:18:33 nbsp Nah, they drop edits.  They sometimes even go backwards as you edit.  They dont count for much anyway... an editor with one edit has as many rights in the wiki as an editor with thousands.  Good ideas come from all quarters.  Users/JabberWokky

20101020 16:59:25 nbsp Eh?  I only edited one.  In general, the Wiki Community/Archiving Comments guidelines derived from the Wiki Community/General Discussion last discussion was that comments should only be archived when there was a reason to do so.  Splitting them up by year is a tool to address the situation of a page that doesnt reflect the current topic, not a mechanical mandate.  In the case of the 2005, I figured that it didnt make for a good wiki page to just have a single review and a single fact by themselves.  Wiki editing is collaborative and in the wiki:wiki:WikiNow. Somebody else can come along and edit them any time. Users/JabberWokky

20101020 18:10:04 nbsp Im working on a Davis Wiki thing right now, but I can do it either later tonight or tomorrow morning. Users/JabberWokky

20101022 10:50:42 nbsp Got a very basic fix in. Im currently cross browser testing, and I may see if I can clarify that subtitle as well. Users/JabberWokky

20101022 12:01:44 nbsp It looks great in everything except IE 6, wheres theres a bit of a border issue... but the cut off top and incorrect framing is fixed for all browsers.  I just uploaded a subtly altered image that I think looks much better.   I know there was one other item, but I cant recall what it was.  Im going to ponder for half an hour or so, and if I can remember what it was, Ill do it.  Users/JabberWokky

20101026 15:52:46 nbsp Thank you, Peter.  I was looking through the Ground Zero page and the first parts kind of dont make sense as some comments seem to be deleted.  Also, we have changed management four times since 2006 and no employees from that time are still there.  With staff changes and many new policies, I feel the posts from 2006 do not reflect the experince one has at GZ.  Nearly all the comments since then are positive, yet they are the last to be seen.  What are your thoughts and can anything be done?  Thanks again. Users/GroundZero

20101026 16:13:13 nbsp Peter.  I dont know who all is running this site, but in a very short amount of time you and hankim have been very helpful.  Thank you! Users/GroundZero

20101026 18:02:56 nbsp Your attempts to work with me can now be equated to cyberbullying. I am not interested in being the best contributor out there. Im interested in leaving a simple contribution that will add a dimension that would be beneficial for other readers see.  Users/anonpincher

20101027 23:44:43 nbsp Regarding your revert of my edit, I helped Rebecca make that page, and what I took out doesnt really fit in with the rest of the entry. In my opinion, I was just trimming some unnecessary lines from the page, but I get that maybe that wasnt the best thing to do.  Users/DylanSchaefer

20101101 13:53:52 nbsp Frankly, I find quite a few of the town characters pages to be pretty messed up.  Many of either explicitly or implicitly ridicule people with mental and/or physical disabilities.  When Ive objected in the past, the response has typically been something to the effect of, theres nothing objectionable when its true.  YMMV. Users/TomGarberson

20101103 20:09:18 nbsp If you disagree with an edit I made, feel free to just undo or alter it.  No need to start a discussion on the entry.  Im always perfectly content to have anything I write on the wiki changed.  If I feel strongly about it, Ill see the edit and reedit toward a mutually acceptable version.  Or Ill miss your change, and thats okay too. Users/JabberWokky

20101104 20:59:52 nbsp Hey Peter, do you really think archiving is necessary for pages like Fluffy Donuts?  There really isnt much left there now.  I think its come up before, but I tend to think that archiving is mostly for when the page becomes unmanageably large (which, in my mind, has happened with very few pages), or when theres an event that makes earlier comments irrelevant except as a historical reference (e.g. change of ownership without change of name).  Archiving for the sake of archiving is just removing info from the page so that people have to go hunting for it.  Oftentimes, those early reviews are the foundation for later onespeople see that 6 commenters already said X is awesome, so they comment about other stuff.  By moving it off the page, theres less information readily available to readers unless they go hunting. Users/TomGarberson
   Clicking on a link that says Reviews for 2005 is not hunting. Its clicking...one...link Users/PeterBoulay

20101104 23:36:28 nbsp Ive reverted William Lewises actions on your edits on Fluffy Donuts. Id suggest you respond directly to Tom Garberson or other editors on this topic. If you object to any edit done by any other editor, you can make a Talk Page for it. I hope other editors will be respectful of your edits, as your contributions here are valued.  Users/DonShor

20101105 12:27:32 nbsp http://daviswiki.org/Fluffy_Donuts?actiondiff&version298&version195 Line 25. Please do not remove text from the body like that. Users/WilliamLewis

20101105 12:50:29   Yes, it is very exasperating to be treated with such disrespect here. I think it discourages editors from participating. Other editors may disagree with your actions, which is fine so long as we all talk about it. I am more concerned about process here than content. Thanks for all the work youre doing on the Wiki. —DonShor




20101105 15:29:46   Peter, Id like to invite you to take a moment and reconsider leaving the Davis Wiki. You really arent being attacked. People disagree with the archiving; thats the full extent of it. William is often abrasive when it comes to reverting; its something weve all had to deal with at one time or another. But no one is making personal attacks.

That said, Davis Wiki has norms which may be different from those youre used to. The central idea behind the Davis Wiki is that through collaborative editing we reach a better end result than any one editor would manage, both on individual pages and on the wiki as a whole. Just like every other collaborative endeavor in the history of mankind, there are going to be disagreements on how to achieve an end, and sometimes even on what end should be achieved. The only way to resolve differences collaboratively is to talk them over.

In the context of archiving, Ive explained—I think fairly politely—what I view as the ends for which archiving is a useful means. It seems like youre upset with that take on things but arent willing to address it. I would hope that my take on things comes across as suggestions or as constructive criticism. If thats not the case, I should reevaluate the way Im doing things.

Youve explain why you archived the comments, and I thank you for that. I and others have explained, though, why we disagree. This isnt a condemnation of you. Its part of the collaborative editing process. Why not join into that process, rather than walking away? I stand behind the archiving of those comments because I think the old comments hurt the page in the following ways... People may or may not agree, but its going to be far more productive and leave everyone feeling a lot better about the whole process after the fact (incidentally, William, Ill make the same suggestion to you...).

I guess what Im trying to say is that in coming into a fairly large community like this with established norms, I think itd serve you well and make editing a more pleasant experience to try and engage within those norms—the collaboration, the retention of information and opinion, and so on. No one expects you to bend over backward to do things the way someone else says to do it; thats not how it works here. But some effort to engage within the existing norms might be pretty valuable. —TomGarberson

20101105 15:36:13   On a totally unrelated note, I realized as soon as I hit save changes that my edit notes in archiving the comments on my user page might come across as a dig at you. They werent! I was just joking about following Hans example of following everyone elses example in cleaning up the user pages. —TomGarberson

20101108 21:03:08 nbsp Good to hear! Users/TomGarberson

20101109 12:35:38 nbsp Agreed, this kind of comment wouldnt stand on many pages that have active followers/guardians... so, why should it stand here?  Unless we hear from others who think that anons comments have merit, I think it should be removed.   Users/KemblePope

20101109 13:08:18 nbsp I agree. Users/DonShor

20101119 18:19:30 nbsp Ehh... its not really relevant to anything on the wiki, but I wouldnt call it spam.  Hes neither vandalizing other pages nor trying to promote himself or a business.  Likely just an inside joke among friends.  Who knows, the house might actually be appropriate on Davis Houses.  And the cats can certainly go on Pets.  Id much rather he bought into the whole Identity thing, but hes not really doing any harm.

At worst, if it is just a waste of packets, its probably something thats easier to clean up once hes done with it than while its still in progress. Users/TomGarberson
    Didnt say he was vandalizing or causing issues, just saying hes a spammer. PeteB

20101120 03:21:55 nbsp What makes you think Users/Aroach12 is a spammer? Has he made any offsite links? Also, that is pretty much his real name (first initial and last name). I dont see any problem at all with any of his edits, I think theyre great. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20101202 13:40:32 nbsp Oh, no... it wasnt intended as an insult at all.  Its just that youre always the first to propose a ban (probably because bans arent all that common on the Davis Wiki, but are elsewhere).  Its just mildly amusing, kind of like somebody who always wants to order Chinese food when theres a get together.  No slight was intended. Users/JabberWokky

I fixed the issue as fast as I could...but still you two kept writing on top of me and reverting my page to older versions after I spent time writing it...that seems completely out of line to me. I wonder where you get the right to mess with my text? Are you the authorized keeper of all wiki knowledge?

20101214 10:28:40 nbsp Quoting Elizabeth: I agree that the photos were an important part of my pet sitting as clients love to see their photos on the pet sitting page. Across the Wiki, she generally posts restaurant reviews, food pictures, and people/pet grooming reviews.  The revertandrevision debacle of 2007 left me with the general feeling that any cleanup nonE people might do would be taken as interfering, and though would ultimately make her page look better, betterless accurate impression of her strengths and weaknesses as a business owner.  It hurts my eyes and editorial heart, but as a nonowner of pets, the effort doesnt seem worthwile.  Since 2007 she has acquired a separate website, which she did not have at the time.

20101218 16:10:00 nbsp Okay, it seems that nobody else has a serious enough issue with the page to push the matter.

20101218 18:08:08 nbsp Luci was breaking copyright law and also using nonDavis related photos, Elizabeth is contributing her own photos of dogs in the Davis community to the wiki (the past issue with her page was that she had huge images randomly aligned back and forth that made the page take a very long time to load and difficult to read).  They are pretty significantly different cases.  One was an issue of legality of use and nonlocal content, the other was a page layout issue (basically, should the page be split into a gallery plus a main page, a la WEF). Users/JabberWokky

I did replace it, at one time, with our actual policy regarding hiring/volunteers, but mistakenly worded it in the first person (from the stores perspective).

The glossy first person promotional content about how wonderful working for the store was Dennis addition.   They can easily coexist, but Dennis writeup was awfully promotional, plus he removed the community members perspective. Users/JabberWokky

20110125 18:45:30 nbsp Its not something I feel strongly about personally, but just so you know, some people really dont like the addition of comment bars to pages that havent previously had a need for comments.  After all, anyone is welcome to edit any part of any page.  See Cut that comment bar out. Users/TomGarberson

20110125 19:11:41 nbsp It really looks bad when you revert every other edit a user makes. Especially when you already have conflicts with that user. So yeah, I disagree with lots of your edits, but Im not going to revert them all.  Users/WilliamLewis

20110125 19:21:37 nbsp Personally, I think we need more userfriendly software before eliminating the one really userfriendly part of it from pages.

20110125 20:19:44 nbsp It doesnt matter anyway; if somebody became fair game to be nasty to the first time they said something over the line, eventually it would just be a nonstop flame war in here.

Their page? That page belongs to the wiki which you and me are a part of, no one has ownership of a page

I have a personal relationship with Doug Prichard (and Jesus Christ) cause he serves me up some good State farm insurance, and yeah its an inside joke how can these two dudes not know each other seeing as its all Good Neighbors. Its friendly competition between agents and the customers who like them, IE Kim for Raul and Me for Doug. Long story short relax and take things with a grain of salt. This is DWiki not TOW, which brings me to my next point: in the future please refrain from reverting or editing anything that I place on the wiki. you can talk with me like a decent person, instead of assuming malice and upping your revert stats.

moreover, your opinion of my opinion carries no relevance to the validity and or appropriateness of MY content that I place on the wiki. Please add to the discussion instead of detracting and or removing content no mater how vapid you may find it...

20110211 07:41:56 nbsp Thanks for the heads up Peter. I wasnt trying to be SHADY, I am just new to the workings of this wiki and how to post things. The authors name was right there, I didnt realize that because it was through my open page that it would be attributed to me. I feel a little insulted that you saw deception, which would be shady, but since the mistake was obvious where is the shade? Now that you have removed the posters comment it is lost. She is not much of a computer person and had asked if she could make a comment right there in the office. Peter, is there a way that you can communicate a possible offense BEFORE taking the liberty of eliminate content from my page? I appreciate a good editor, lord knows I am not one, but this style seems a bit pushy. Thanks for your response, Peter.  Users/bryoncloyd

20110216 12:18:09 nbsp I do not understand why you keep approaching me about proposing bans.  Just go ahead and do it. Users/JabberWokky

20110216 12:35:11 nbsp Bans here are typically proposed in a users/name/talk page or other subpage, and aside from spammers, never happen unilaterally.  While JW has admin power, he is and acts as an editor on the wiki, same as everyone else.  I suspect people would get behind a ban on this person, but it happens, like pretty much everything else here, via community decision. Users/TomGarberson

20110216 12:51:37 nbsp Its not my decision either.  Its up to the community.  If you want to propose a ban, it is, like I said, not up to me if you propose a ban.  As I wind up actually being the one who implements the ban, I generally try to not be the one to propose it.  If its either a clear cut case (commercial spammers, blatant vandalism), it tends to get done immediately... and occasionally not obviously, as the commercial spammers often get IP banned at the server level rather than the Davis Wiki level (as they are typically multiplewiki spammers). Users/JabberWokky

20110216 12:52:04 nbsp Right.  I dont disagree.  Im just saying that asking JW to ban someone probably isnt going to do much without some conversation on the issuehence the suggestion to start a /Talk or /Ban page. Users/TomGarberson

20110216 18:21:39 nbsp Please be mindful of the fact that this wiki documents Davis as it is and as it was. You were so quick to delete departed businesses without giving any thought to the context in which they were listed.  Users/WilliamLewis

20110321 13:20:21 nbsp Okay.  Revert is an option available to anybody, and you can certainly restart that.  I dont think that discussion was healthy nor productive and was starting to seriously damage interpersonal relations.  I do not think I am alone in that belief.

At this point, a revert war (which is what is happening now) is actually less damaging, and much more to the point, as it involves actually discussing content. Users/JabberWokky

20110321 13:37:50 nbsp Hey Pete.  The Village Cab Talk page has been in a downward spiral.  I think the deleted page is more of a group Wiki Chill Pill than a scorched earth approach.  Multiple editors have already been severely alienated over the issue, and the way its going, that seems likely to spread.  Probably the best thing that could happen right now is for everyone involved to give it a couple of days and, if they still deem it necessary, return to the discussion with a fresh perspective. Users/TomGarberson

20110321 18:11:11 nbsp Your jumping on the rename broke the link to the comment archive. Please fix it. The ampersand character is just fine in page names; Williams comment had two parts and it appears that you only glanced at the first part. Users/JasonAller

20110329 18:18:53 nbsp That would appear to be the community decision, yes.  The method is fairly consistent, but the outcome can vary wildly based on who is involved and what their perspective of the situation is.  Somebody else may have been banned.  Users/JabberWokky

20110329 18:21:02 nbsp The question of the ban has been resolved.  There are a lot of issues that still need discussion, given the dramatic change in stance on personal attacks, etc., but the ban page probably isnt the place to do it. Users/TomGarberson

20110329 18:24:14 nbsp Most such discussions never involve polling people.  This one did (as that suddenly seems to be the tool in vogue).  Reread the deleted page.  There was a heavy leaning toward not banning him. Users/JabberWokky

20110329 18:27:41 nbsp Youre really saying that nobody has told Josh to knock it off with the language and personal attacks?  I banned him because of it, Peter, and there was a proposal to permaban him because of his attacks... and a general agreement from several people who didnt support a ban yet (because they didnt see the edits as personal attacks) that they would support one if they thought he was using the wiki as a malicious tool to attack people. What else are you looking for?  A hanging? Users/JabberWokky

20110329 18:34:41 nbsp I did ban him, Peter. Users/JabberWokky

20110329 18:45:39 nbsp http://daviswiki.org/Users/JoshLawson?actionrecall&version16 Here.  When it was an acute situation.  When the community weighed in on a long term ban, well... you saw the results.  As a community run wiki, it can be difficult to ban people.  It does happen, however... people eventually give up on supporting an individual abusing the wiki in one way or another.  While it does takes strong consensus, a dedicated jerk can eventually get there.  Users/JabberWokky

20110329 20:25:41 nbsp http://daviswiki.org/Vaage_Construction?actiondiff&version23&version12 Your edit sort of gives an implied approval to http://daviswiki.org/Vaage_Construction?actiondiff&version22&version11 Steves edit. Youve made several address or email macro edits to pages that have appeared on Recent Changes, but often it appears that you either missed what the other person did, or approved of it. Users/JasonAller

20110329 20:53:10 nbsp I mentioned that because you edit like you want to be a gnome and I was pointing out something Ive noticed in your editing habits that didnt fit that pattern. Users/JasonAller

20110330 10:10:58 nbsp I think Jasons trying to say that if you only edited because someone else bumped a page up the recent changes, but you dont fix their mistake, its a bad thing.

Its as if I saw someone throw away a bag of fast food, and miss, its now on the sidewalk.  However, I notice theres a recycle bin next to the trash can, so I take over a bottle I just found in the gutter.  Its not necessarily my job to clean up someone elses litter, but Jasons saying its pretty weird if I ignore/walk over the trash to recycle, because the only reason Im recycling is the guy littering is what drew my initial attention.

If I was really trying to do the right thing, or gnome the wiki, whatever, Id have done both.  Clean it up while recycling.  Users/EdWins
  For what its worth, when I see a paired set of edits where the second one is a gnome, I dont bother reading it, as I assume that they fixed the formatting error, corrected spelling and generally cleaned up anything that needed to be fixed.  I had figured that was the case with Pete. jw
    I didnt know quite how to address Steves post so I figured Id let someone else address it. PeteB

20110509 nbsp If youve seen other pages that do that, then youve seen other pages whose address macro is broken.  Go through the edits and see for yourself; the Map function did not work the way you had edited it.  cp

20121114 12:36:30 nbsp Its funny  when you posted Toms proposed notice to the page, Tom IMed me and said he wished you had waited until there was community feedback and consensus so that there could be direct action.  Its the same reason I asked for more input from people.  With this latest comment, Andrew may be typing in all caps, but the content is relatively civil, stating his case regarding this specific item.  Pretty much what everybody was asking him to do.  This may well not hold, and Im not advocating forgetting the past or watching for new threats, but this specific latest edit is him making his case and literally saying you guys be a judge of good conscience. Users/JabberWokky

20121114 12:56:40 nbsp Yes.  I know you posted it.  Thats what I was saying above. Users/JabberWokky

20121114 13:14:03 nbsp If anybody had felt strongly enough, they could have retracted it.  Dont worry about it... Im only explaining my reasoning.  We didnt have enough time invested so that everybody was solid on the same page about how to handle things.  Lest you think Im naive, I do have a feeling theres going to be a ban.  Im only working against it because its always an option, so Ill still try for the best possible outcome right up to that moment.  Plus I think Tom is right: its unlikely to help in this case. Users/JabberWokky

20121114 13:22:22 nbsp Yeah, just to be clear, I dont think its the end of the world.  My only concern is that an ultimatum coming from one or two users is essentially just a threat.  By contrast, if theres consensus that if user X repeats Y, Z will be the consequence, its not just a threat from one user but a genuine ultimatum.  Bans and similar administrative action dont occur without genuine consensus, and if you have that ahead of time, it adds weight to whatever ultimatum is tossed out there.  It means that if the user repeats Y, the result is Z instead of a new, lengthy discussion about whether Z should occur. Users/TomGarberson

20121114 16:13:24 nbsp Youre probably right :)  I figured Id try, though.  For what its worth, Andrews start on the wiki was being outright attacked by the other cabbies in town.  Hes been somewhat difficult to work with... but a part of that is probably the language barrier, and the rough start is likely also a contributing factor.  Maybe if hes given the chance to tell things from his side, and doesnt feel like hes being attacked (as he clearly felt with Wess comment), hell be a bit more reasonable.

I dunno.  Just thought Id give it a shot.

That said, Dons idea of permanently locking all cab pages sounds awfully nice. Users/TomGarberson

20121120 19:03:29 nbsp Yeah I saw the comment. I wound up not actually fixing it. I figured youd fix it if you wanted it fixed. A Las Vegas wiki would be a monstrous undertaking. I dont know that I have the time or computer skills for such a thing. Id love for it to exist and would contribute if it did, but starting it would be a huge job :( Creating a wiki for nonstrip regions would probably be more feasible since most people on the strip are tourists and probably less likely to look at wiki than residents of a nearby region.  Users/LoriOrf

20121121 14:32:27 nbsp You didnt do anything wrong, no need to apologize.  Im just a little bit irritated by the whole thing.  COs position seems extremely contrary to pretty much all wiki principles to me, but she acts like shes being attacked and everyone else is a barbarian when people disagree with her on any point.  I decided to be a little more blunt this afternoon. Users/TomGarberson

20121121 15:59:34 nbsp Read the new main text about chicken wings again please.

Users/ConstantiaOomen

20121121 18:30:09 nbsp @ Pete You really dont understand me. It is the meat eaters being intolerant and not willing to show some decency concerning animals and vegans and vegetarians.

20130130 17:19:11 nbsp Ehh, Im reluctant to get to far into what might be construed as legal advice on here.  I will say this, though: if the identification of the individual is accurate, I dont see anything in there that screams defamation.

On a purely nonlegal front, I will say that given the amount of detail in both comments, I doubt theres a mistake of identity.  I doubt shes had a large number of tenants leave a queen sized mattress which had to be hauled away for $65, or a large number of tenants who disputed the arithmetic on the security deposit refund.

Calling out the tenant by name seems to me to be more a question of style than of legality.  It may be bad form, but I honestly kinda liked the rest of the response (apart from identifying the person by name).  I particularly liked the closing sentence. Users/TomGarberson

20130130 19:44:53 nbsp I agree with Toms nonlegal comments.  Other than calling the person out by name, its a great response.  It puts the whole episode in a new light. Users/CovertProfessor

20130130 19:50:49 nbsp Also, given the specific details of the accusation and the response, it is very likely that she has IDed the commenter properly. Users/gcoville

20130307 15:46:49 nbsp Yeah, par for the course  hardly anyone reads the instructions.  I dont know if weve had more lately or not; weve also had a couple who had their act together from the outset, which is also nice to see.  Deleting links is just a particular beef of mine  it shows a complete disregard for the wiki in favor of promoting ones business (for free!  on the wiki! which is there to serve me without me giving back!  woo hoo!) Users/CovertProfessor

20130318 15:38:53 nbsp Obviously, I do too, which is why I called her out on it.  I just think youre unlikely to get her to admit it a second time, especially on her business page.  She has, however, admitted it explicitly on the wiki.  She is guilty as charged.  What more do we need? Users/CovertProfessor

20130318 16:02:05 nbsp In my opinion, thats a bit overthetop, but start a ban discussion if you want.  I wont support it, though. Users/CovertProfessor

20130319 13:56:12 nbsp I agree that it has been a mostly productive discussion.  However, if I may offer a possible explanation as to why Jim reacted the way that he did  you were very quick to call for a ban/deletion.  In general, bans and deletions seem to be your first reaction, whereas the general trend on the Davis wiki is that such reactions are last resorts, not first resorts.  Perhaps this is why you came across as overly emotionally involved, even if you were not. Users/CovertProfessor

20130319 16:31:59 nbsp I dont want to start an on going argument but this is my live hood and I fight for what Im passionate about. Neither one of the bites was I breaking rules .

20130319 21:39:39 nbsp Part of the reason I dont participate on the wiki very often is because I do get defensive and take things to heart. Its just this whole process has been emotionally draining and hard on me because my business is being put down and my personal dog is ridiculed . I tried to answer questions the best I could without sounding upset and take neutral sides but meggo waffle really triggers me because she has been on me over over a yr saying I lied and such when honestly  I dont know who she is talking about that approached me and she refuses to give Names which I respect. I dont usually take sides. I am registered with PSI and bonded and insured through business of the Carolinas . I would be happy to include my member ID number and or post a picture of my membership card. I dont like how people are quick to judge and if someone were jeopardizes your business you would do your best to make sure they were all legimitate responses. Users/ElizabethBarthel

20130319 21:53:44 nbsp I will call them tomorrow thank you for the suggestion  Users/ElizabethBarthel

20130319 22:11:49 nbsp Thanks, Pete.  Just keeping busy.  Ive been a bit swamped at work.  A staffing change and three (of 8) lawyers all winding up in multiweek trials simultaneously has left a lot of slack to pick up.  Its fun work with a boatload of great experience, but its definitely been cutting into my free time the last couple of weeks. Users/TomGarberson

20130319 22:32:03 nbsp Agreed, you did back off very quickly, which I respect. Users/CovertProfessor

20130320 13:59:49 nbsp Oh, and god forbid we say anything subjective.  We wouldnt want to wiki to reflect actual human reactions of the community of Davis. Users/CovertProfessor

20130320 14:01:08 nbsp Its OK, but youre laboring under a misunderstanding of what this wiki is supposed to be.  Rewrites like that make the whole thing a bit ponderous and not much fun to read. Users/CovertProfessor

20130320 15:14:46 nbsp There is no both... there are as many points of view as there are people involved.  I tend to agree with CP, however.  Youre unnecessarily stating why you edited in the actual text.

It is as if you said:

The red double decker buses run around town.

They are red because many people below have observed them to be red.

Well, no.  They are not red because people said they were.  They just are red.  People agree they are red, but you dont need to state why the editing rational behind the statement.  That is needlessly wordy, and is not actually about the subject of the entry, it is about the entry itself.  It is a statement describing the wiki, not a statement describing the buses (or eye doctor). Users/JabberWokky

20130402 20:53:28 nbsp Pete, youre a pretty cool guy. Users/BrentLaabs

20130410 18:23:54 nbsp It probably shouldnt be there, and I seem to recall we had a discussion about it when it appeared, and made it smaller as a compromise.  There is a grey area between what is promotional and what is informational; the coupon might arguably be in that grey area, though it might also arguably be simply promotional.  Im not in the mood to argue over that, though, because it opens up the question of whether, e.g., we can mention happy hour specials, which I think people want to know.  On the other hand, the Yelp, etc., reviews open up a brand new can of worms that I would really like to keep closed. Users/CovertProfessor

20130417 15:30:37 nbsp Im sorry!  That makes it very confusing though.  Can I remove them once I have photos of the new space? Users/arica

20130430 21:37:34 nbsp Oh Thanks, I didnt understand. I thought it was a sidekick of Davis Wiki, something like Mystery picture lol Users/ConstantiaOomen

20130501 16:45:53 nbsp Thanks, but I think its best that new editors understand that this is a collaborative process.  I am well aware that other editors may judge things differently than I do, and I think it works best when different people chime in (as happened on the Oakshade Commons Apartments/Talk page). Users/CovertProfessor

20130502 12:19:05 nbsp Hey Peter, I dont believe AutNo is spam. Its relevant to that page, along with the others. Typing in Davis, CA on AutNo brought up some nice options not found on other rental sites. Care to clarify? The page I am referring to was: http://daviswiki.org/Apartments Users/mammer

20130504 22:03:53 nbsp You posed a question as why have 2 account?  The other one is unrecoverable as that I dont have that email address anymore and I dont remember the password.  I also deleted the account many months back. Users/ToddJames007

20130506 15:19:20 nbsp Good, thanks. Users/CovertProfessor

20130509 10:42:27 nbsp Nope. but thanks for the offer.  Remember, we all agreed to intentionally wait so that the person had time to ask questions, engage in communication with other editors, or close the account themselves.  Thats why I do them in batches, spaced out and with plenty of time.  If you check, youll see that when I do a batch that had one just added, I skip that one, leaving it for the next batch.   That way the person has a period of time to get the messages left to them and communicate with the rest of the community.  The delay in closing them is by intent, and based on community discussion regarding the accounts.

Of course, we also agreed to not use the include only or as the first contact, and instead always add a personal note, contacting the person using the account at least twice, and at least 24 hours apart, but not everybody does that.  The include was supposed to be the second step (although I notice that in the steps, it has somehow been moved up to the first step, even if the surrounding text is pretty clear that it is intended to be the second step, a minimum of 24 hours after a personal note and if the account continues being used). Users/JabberWokky

20130605 21:15:17 nbsp Grr... for some reason I dont get that messages indicator on the Wiki anymore.  Havent for a year or two now.  Anyway, see the Talk pagewhich I made before seeing youd left me a message. Users/TomGarberson

20130606 13:53:19 nbsp It was only added to the To Do list in the last month.  Ill scoop them all soon.  Also, Ill note that in the original discussion it was agreed that a simple include would be insufficient outreach: somebody should probably write a personal note to them on their user profile. The include is so officious it is very easy to ignore. Users/JabberWokky

20130606 22:29:53 nbsp I think a personal note on their profile would suffice.  Feel free to call them as well, of course.  Users/JabberWokky

20130618 19:51:15 nbsp Reasons you dont have a girlfriend
1.no one Likes you
2.no one likes you
3.you waste your life on wikis when you could be doing something productive

 Users/123Guy

    Oh youve found me outtoo bad youre wildly offbase.  I dont have a girlfriend?? GREATmy wife of 10 years will appreciate that. As for wasting my life on Wikis you are the one who spends time on the Wiki to insult other people. Sounds like much more of a waste to me. Users/PeteB

20130620 12:30:53 nbsp Yeah, Im sure its a spammer too.  But if you shoot everybody dead who walks in the door for the wrong reason, even if it is pretty clear they are soliciting, then you have a home where everybody is quick to shoot people.  Being super fast on the banhammer makes for marginally less spam... and a much less friendly and more paranoid community.  People are comfortable that they can argue ideas with each other here in freedom, just like they can on the sidewalk.  It seems a pain in the butt, but consider that theres not a ton more spam here than other similar profile sites.  The civility typically squares up with real life rather than the hypernasty tone that the internet is prone to: our aholes are typically aholes in person too.  The price paid is a few extra reverts a month.  The reward is a friendlier community where the good apples can be comfortable nobody is going to get banned for doing something wrong once.  And everybody has a bad day every once in awhile.

I do ban in obvious cases, and honestly, in this case it could certainly have gone the other way (and typically would have).  I just happened to do the welcome rather than a flattening on the first pass.  Second pass (if they ever even edit again) will almost certainly be a quick boot.  Plus I added the domains they added to the wikispot spamsearch bot so they will pop up if they add them again to any wiki on the network. Users/JabberWokky

20130716 17:03:47 nbsp It seems to me that if a person has a good experience with a business, that person ( who I now know who it is) should post it on That business not someone elses business. Or, are you saying I should do the same on that businesss wiki page? Users/martinennor

20130716 17:21:22 nbsp Wow, take a break from the wiki to let things cool down and this is where you guys want to take it. Not sure who you talked to at Biria USA and Lynskey, but according to Michael Biria @ BiriaUSA (2014611980) and Don Erwin, Sales Manager or Jack Kopeski, Sales Account Manager @ Lynskey Performance (423.499.5815) I I am still an authorized dealer and considered a non stocking dealer respectively. As for Van Dessel, I was the only dealer in the area for a long time and did not think to ever renew my dealership agreement as I always just ordered when I needed one. Im fine with the removal of Van Dessel, but I urge you to call the names above to confirm my status with Biria and Lynskey. I await your all powerful verdicts.  Aaron (07/16/13) Users/Aaron.Curtin

20130801 13:58:54 nbsp Alot of the ASUCD petty politicians are just carpetbaggers. If they dont want to be part of town history I think thats just fine. The politics is just a means for them to all congratulate each other on how influential they are to each other as they would do at any student body. Even I dont have much to contribute to the wiki, since I dont live in Davis anymore. The wiki should really be left up to people who have local info to contribute. Help from outside is ok if wanted by those who live in Davis, but outsiders telling people what to do who are actually in town and might have something real to contribute will just discourage new information and kill the wiki faster.

20130803 14:32:27 nbsp Hey peteb, so not sure about that pink id, the other one however by slowyouroll, i attempted to look at security cameras for that day and it appears that goes too far back to find out who would have done the. Its weird/uncanny however, that review almost sounds just like one we had to comment on. Try looking at our most recent comment by and aggie something, we really have no idea how someone could have done that at that time, unless one of our residents logged on, which would have been very unlikely, let me know what you can come up with.

I figure everybody can have a bad day, and sometimes it can be your first day on the wiki.  When I posted the edit comment, I thought she might only be reading those and missing the communication on her profile.

Users/ConstantiaOomen

20130925 18:45:10 nbsp Hahaha > MY identity issue? I never realized I had one. I think you are mistaking me with yourself, CP and some other anonymous persons.

20130925 20:55:03 nbsp Pete B, you remove all my comments, and you keep attacking me, with two, meanwhile three false accusations (one: I pushed CP away, two: I threatened you and three: I exposed your name). Do you think that is fair? Furthermore: you yourself have published your name and your hobbies etc. here on Davis Wiki. In your earlier comments you mention you are going to pick up my books here in New York. So, I am just repeating what you are saying. You are slandering my Wiki page (I threatened you? Sure Peter, in your dreams) and I am not removing that, because I honor the rules and you dont.
Maybe I would have a valid case against you, namely: slander. Users/ConstantiaOomen
