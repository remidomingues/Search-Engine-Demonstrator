Argyle is currently a junior specialist at UC Davis and has come to appreciate the words of wisdom and enjoyable comment arguments that adorn this wiki (see Monticello for an example). Also, she has yet to find a restaurants restaurant in Davis that she really likes. But she does have quite the love affair with the northern Nugget.

Other notable facts about Argyle:
  she graduated at the end of Fall 2011 with a degree in Bio Sci (3 years and 1 quarter, baby!)
  she currently works in a lab on campus
  however, she has no interest in academia/research as a career
  she will continue to work in said lab after graduation
  though Davis food has disappointed her, favorite restaurants include Hoa Viet, Taqueria Davis, and Namaste Nepal Restaurant Namaste
  she would like to try the more upscale restaurants, but shes still a poor college student
