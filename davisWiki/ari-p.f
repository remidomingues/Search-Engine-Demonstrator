20100131 19:35:35 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. I think certain topics need to be handled with sensitivity and perhaps not a blanket application of the usual practice of not deleting comments... but... I do feel that pointing out that there is a general pattern of respecting the comments of others and that no one person or organization owns the content of any page here on the wiki.

20100131 19:52:53 nbsp Please dont censor the wiki. Users/WilliamLewis
 Please dont delete my comments  Users/StevenDaubert

I apologize, I was requested to delete them since they were seen as a call to action, and Hillel has requested any mention or recommendation be removed.  Users/arip

20100131 21:07:29 nbsp How can there be http://daviswiki.org/Fred_Phelps?actiondiff&version231&version130 official language of hillel when no plans of counter protest were made? Users/WilliamLewis

Mea Culpa, this is a long story, and I will respond to the issue of this tomorrow.  I hope that is okay.   Users/arip


20100131 21:08:25 nbsp You might want to edit Fred Phelps/Talk and explain the reason behind the edits.  The Talk page is temporary (its deleted when the discussion ends), and can probably allow you to explain your position and let you read about and try to understand the position of other people.  Its meta, meaning it is for discussion about the editing of a topic, not about the topic itself (which would go directly on the main entry).  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20100201 10:45:10 nbsp There were plans for a counter protest amongst various groups on campus. Also, their schedule does show an unfamiliarity with the area. I cant see how you can possibly justify removing this perfectly factual information. Users/WilliamLewis

20100201 12:55:33 nbsp I think the clarification is complete... no need to keep nitpicking.  There was just some confusion regarding the positions.  I didnt edit the entry (until just recently), but I wasnt exactly sure what you were saying.  With what you wrote on the Talk page, its all now pretty clear.  Thanks for the patience in explaining things; Im pretty sure William was just trying to keep the entry honest, which is a laudable goal. Users/JabberWokky
