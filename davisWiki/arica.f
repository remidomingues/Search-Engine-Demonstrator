20090430 19:47:16 nbsp Im just wondering if you have bigger versions of the extension before/after pictures. The wiki can automatically resize the pictures for display on the page while letting users click through to the original size for more details. Users/WilliamLewis

If you want to do that, all you have to do is go to the current page, click edit at the top of the page, then at the bottom of the editing window there is another button that says rename. If you click that, you can enter a new page name and it will automatically create a new page with that name, move all the content over to that page, and turn the current one into a redirect to the new one.
