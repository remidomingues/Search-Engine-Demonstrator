20091014 16:53:40 nbsp Hi, there, and a belated welcome to the Wiki. I noticed on your recent edits of Le Tournesol Apartments that you noted management updates. Are you the (new?) manager of the apartment building? Users/robinlaughlin

20100924 09:00:40 nbsp Hey!  You can make the Tres Hermanas page!  Just like you can edit anything on the wiki.  Just click Edit in the blue bar at the top of the page and start telling Davis about the restaurant.  Dont worry about getting everything perfect, as other people can follow up and correct any spelling errors.  Thats how the wiki works!  :)   Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20110402 16:55:39 nbsp Ashleyyour comments for Le Tournesol Apartments are odd. You dont sign them and are posting as if you are a resident but the history shows youve done management updates in the past. Do you live there AND work for them?Users/PeterBoulay

20120608 11:50:34 nbsp Yes. I work and manage the property. Since 2005.
Sorry for the confusion. Users/ashleyinthemist
