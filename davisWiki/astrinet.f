20091110 23:20:38 nbsp  Welcome to the Wiki. You can establish identity here in a variety of ways. If you are a business owner doing that is even more important as is reading Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner. Youve already chosen your Importance of using your RealName username, but the username youve picked doesnt acknowledge that this is a community of editors. Im guessing that you dont introduce yourself as Mr. or Mrs. Astrinet. The next step would be to introduce yourself and make some positive contributions like adding business reviews, Photo Requests uploading photos, or adding to Seed Pages List pages that need more information.
