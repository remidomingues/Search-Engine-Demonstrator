20080727 21:17:46 nbsp Youve been around a while so Im just going to ask what the rational behind http://daviswiki.org/McDonald%27s?actiondiff&version264&version163 this edit was? Users/JasonAller

20080729 14:30:58 nbsp I thought it was somewhat inappropriate and a bit harsh for someone to write that. Although I understand why the user was upset (taking the time and effort to drive there, only to be disappointed and misled), I didnt believe it was right to make personal stabs like that  service workers are often underappreciated.

20081024 20:58:48 nbsp This comment goes out to at86! I find it rude and inappropriate to make up false accusations about good respectable businesses! What did you get out of making bad comments towards other people?

In case anyone els did not notice this person at86 make a bad comment about Angies beauty salon and Kasmos hair salon AND it just so happens to say the same exact thing and claim to have gone in that same day! WHAT THE HECK!!!!!!

It is people like at86 that make it hard to belive the comments that people make on websites like this!!! Ughhh this is suppose to be a place for guidance not misguidance!  Users/Mrs.Salcido

20081025 17:51:22 nbsp Dear Mrs. Salcido,
I am not sure what you are talking about. First of all, everyone is entitled to their own opinions about whether or not they are satisfied with the service they have received from businesses. Second, people do not necessarily have to review businesses the same day they visit them; writing a review for one hair salon may have simply just reminded me to write a review for another salon (plus, your claim of me making the same comments on the same day for both salons doesnt holdboth comments are more than half a year apart). This does not necessarily mean I am trying to make the other salon look bad in comparison the other. In fact, I usually try to point out both positives and negatives about places, and offer advice to future potential customers. If my comment seemed offensive or directed toward a particular person, I certainly did not mean to do that. Its not like Im telling people NOT to go there. Users/at86
