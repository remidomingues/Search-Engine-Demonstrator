Food
I find that food is an art form consumed and that food should be experienced.   With that said, some of my friend consider me pretty anal about food  I just wont eat anywhere.   Heck, why should I?  The price for good food and bad food is the about the same so why should I have bad food?!?

20091130 08:48:43 nbsp I havent been to too many restaurants in Woodland, Sac, or Dixon, but basically my priorities are the same wherever I go.  I like dishes with lots of fresh vegetables, tasty sauces, dogfriendly outdoor tables, and good desserts.  :)  I tend to prefer ethnic food (whatever that means) to American food.  Although nothing beats a good pizza (opinions seem to differ on whether American pizza actually qualifies as Italian food). Users/CovertProfessor
