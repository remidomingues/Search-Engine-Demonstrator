20080402 20:37:53 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. Please read Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner; it will help explain how you can make the wiki a positive experience for you without clashing with established wiki social norms. Users/JasonAller

20080402 21:43:29 nbsp Aziz my man, welcome to the wiki. I love village bakery and have been getting awesome pizza ever since I stumbled upon it earlier, Im a davisite and I enjoy village bakery products at places like hotdogger and various restaurants. But you gotta chill on the deleting stuff, respond to the allegations, explain why its slander and libel, and tell the wiki that you are here to listen to what it has to say to you as a business owner.

20080403 09:22:08 nbsp Hey, Aziz... one of the things I miss most about Davis is swinging by, picking up a loaf of bread and heading to the park to split it with the woman who is now my wife.  Village Bakery is great!  As for the current issue, deleting the comments without a response isnt really going to work, alas, you need to respond to them, and I think youll find loads of support.  Everybody has their say, just like at most public venues.  You cant shout down another person in a public meeting, and deleting a comment without a reply is pretty much the same thing.  Any response you write to him will be defended in the same way if that guy tries to delete it; everybody has their opportunity to speak. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20080404 08:38:30 nbsp Okay, I really have to ask why you are now specifically picking out and deleting positive reviews http://daviswiki.org/Village_Bakery?actiondiff&version2168&version1167 like this one.  Im quite curious about that particular edit. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20080404 19:22:08 nbsp How do we know this is really Aziz? If he was gonna create an account just to delete the comments, why would he use his real first name? For all we know its the same person who made the initial claim that started the issue. Users/SunjeetBaadkar
   That would explain the deletion of the positive comments... jw

20080405 00:41:45 nbsp We dont.  Identification, and reputation, of wiki posters is a major issue.  Even people who do not exist might be posting.  And how would you know? Users/IDoNotExist
    I usually just call the actual person at their office or place of business and simply ask them.  Its not a big deal.  You can find spots around the wiki where Ive done it... why dont you just walk into Village Bakery and ask?  It takes just a couple minutes of usually pleasant conversation, and it is a fantastic way to help somebody who might have questions about the wiki. I know Jasons also walked into a couple businesses to verify the identity of a person.  This isnt the wild and wooley internet... its a rather small town with a nice community. jw
