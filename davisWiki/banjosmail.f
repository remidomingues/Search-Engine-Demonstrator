Welcome to the Wiki Howdy, Mr. or Ms. Smail, and Welcome to the Wiki!   You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you (or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here).  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for uploading the image to Pixilated Sisters... you accidentally uploaded it in the wrong place, but I moved it over for you, and added it to the entry.  It would be great if you could write and tell us a bit about what Pixilated Sisters is!  Thanks for the photo!Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
