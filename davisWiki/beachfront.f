Welcome to the Wiki Howdy, Todd, and Welcome to the Wiki!   You probably only want to use one account rather than this as a sockpuppet second one, and might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you (or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here).  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for adding the info about Consumers Guide... feel free to add more to the Front Page wiki as a whole.  Oh, by the way... I had added the coupon you uploaded, but you keep removing it now.  Any reason it shouldnt be there? Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
