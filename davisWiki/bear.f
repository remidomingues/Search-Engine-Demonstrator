welcome to the wiki indeed!  Users/StevenDaubert

20100212 00:05:21 nbsp thanks JoePomidor and StevenDaubert for the welcome! I miss living in Berkeley, but Davis seems to have quite a few of the same qualities I loved about Berkeley. Users/bear

20100212 04:58:20 nbsp Indeed.  My wife and I have to move twice for her academic career, and Berkeley is one of our first move choices, with Davis being one of our two second move, permanent residence picks.  Davis is great. Users/JabberWokky

20110103 20:07:20 nbsp Youre right, there are relatively few young professionals in Davis.  The major job markets are either east or west of here, and housing is significantly cheaper in both directions (in all directions, for that matter).  One good way to find others in the demographic is to meet up with some of the professional students.  A lot of significant others of vet, law, med, etc. students fit the bill.  The same is likely true for grad students. Users/TomGarberson
