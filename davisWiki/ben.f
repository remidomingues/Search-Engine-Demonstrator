My name is King Ng and Iâ€™m a 3rd year undergraduate student majoring in Civil Engineering. I prefer to be called Ben though. I like to play basketball and run in my spare time. I grew up in China and came to the United States during the 6th grade. I went through school in Sacramento and ended up coming to UC Davis.

Some hobbies that I enjoy doing are playing basketball, the wii and warcraft 3. I also enjoy fishing a lot even though I do not like eating them as a meal.
