20080222 03:26:58 nbsp Have you considered moving Christopher Cabaldon to wiki:westsac? If most of the text comes from wikipedia you might just link there also. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20080222 14:41:10 nbsp Hey Brandon its good to see you on the wiki! Users/GregWebb

20080330 15:27:04 nbsp Hi Brandon!  What do you mean by sort of a third year student at UCD?  <smile>

Also, Obama is the man! Users/CurlyGirl26

20080410 02:35:53 nbsp Well, the thing is, last quarter, I wasnt a student because I had to withdraw at the end of Fall Quarter 2007. But, now in lovely Spring 2008, I am a student again! Users/brandonhkey

20080814 01:52:31 nbsp A category for things that you dont really know where to put. Uhhh, arent we already in Student Organizations? I mean.....Yeah.

Also, Im probably working with UCD SFBO this Fall on a bunch of stuff I wanted to do w/DCD, but always had too much on my plate, and hopefully I can help with peaceful postelection unification. Users/MaxMikalonis

20080814 03:24:19 nbsp I generally tend to edit things that show up on the Recent Changes feed. Users/JoePomidor

20080814 08:30:47 nbsp The People list is alphabetic.  You might want to move yourself to the proper location under K.  :) Users/JabberWokky

20080814 08:40:04 nbsp Hey, Brandon  is that photo of Barak Obama under Copyrights Creative Commons?  (I know some candidates released their publicity images, some didnt... and if not, there are public domain Senator photos available that are a bit more stodgy but perfectly legal to use). Users/JabberWokky

20080814 19:29:00 nbsp Actually, the wiki discussed this awhile back and went with the internation standard YYYYMMDD, as it sorts easier (plus its increasingly common all over the web and forms).  Check out all the templates and search for ISO Date for more information. Users/JabberWokky

20080814 19:30:13 nbsp Oh, and I made the tense past because in cases where people are unlikely to update it, it makes more sense to have it wrong for a few days than wrong for months or years waiting for somebody to come along and correct it.  YMMV. Users/JabberWokky

20080814 19:34:00 nbsp Re: your comment to me.  Of course anybody can cheat  it just cheats everybody and lowers the mutual trust we all share.  Its a bad thing.  And as for the People entry, Im listed twice, once under my signing checks name (but Im registered to vote under Jabber Wokky). :) Users/JabberWokky

20080815 01:13:29 nbsp Well, there always is http://www.google.com/search?qbrandonhkey%20site%3Adaviswiki.org Google. Users/JabberWokky
