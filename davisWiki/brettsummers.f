20080129 20:03:41 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. I noticed your edit comment when you first edited the University Village page was Quite subjective. The wiki community here at Davis Wiki, of which you are now part, has generally decided not to use Neutral Point Of View when editing pages and rather to present many points of view when possible. If you have a business relationship with University Village it may also be worthwhile to read Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner. Users/JasonAller

20080131 10:21:20 nbsp No business relationship other than my girl and i have lived at UV for two years.  We were shown the wiki comments and quite frankly i understand the wiki is an open forum... but may i ask who authored the introductory comments.  we have friends that live at Arlington and theirs seem to be a bit less subjective.  i will continue to post the non subjective information because it could be considered deformation to have incorrect information on your webiste.  it is embarassing to see the history of a riot from four years ago??? when my friends look to the wiki as a resource.   Users/brettsummers
 First of all, the occurrence of the riot is clearly not subjective. It is also clear the place is under new management since then. If you want to see who wrote something on a page, use the Info button http://www.daviswiki.org/University_Village?actioninfo to see the history. If you think the introduction should be rewritten, you are welcome to do it. Im not sure of the significance of being considered deformation to have incorrect information on a webiste. Nevertheless, please correct what you believe to be untrue, and if there is disagreement work it out. Thanks very much.  Users/NickSchmalenberger
