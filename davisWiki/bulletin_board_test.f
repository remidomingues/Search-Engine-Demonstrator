  Davis Food Coop address(the bulletin board at the Davis Food Coop, 38.549560, 121.739994) is awesome.

Id say just make sure each location (e.g. coop) has a map point on that places page.  That means that this page wont show you all of the points by clicking on the map, but if you are interesting in finding a given place you can just follow the link and then click Map.  The problem with putting a bunch of map points on a single page is that it could clutter up the map (nearby locations when looking at other pages) with bulletin board locations that are on top of places like the coop.

20070827 13:12:16 nbsp I mean to say that theres no reason to create a map point for the Davis Food Coop board because theres a page for the Davis Food Coop and it has a map on it? Users/PhilipNeustrom

20070827 13:18:52 nbsp I see.  There is no way at this point to declutter the other markers showing up on the map?  I thought this might be good for parts of campus where the board is on one wing of a larger structure(s), such as the memorial union. Users/jefftolentino

20100419 17:01:53 nbsp I think better mapping functions would be very useful.  This page is definitely old, but I was hoping to generate some new ideas for improving how we map things here.  I think my main problem here was that everthing mapped within a few hundred feet of this bulletin board on Daviswiki showed up the map.  Would be nice to weed out unneeded map points.

On a similar note, it would also be nice to be able to put together maps of similar things in town, (such as red light cameras, bike pumps, bulletin boards, etc.)   Users/jefftolentino
