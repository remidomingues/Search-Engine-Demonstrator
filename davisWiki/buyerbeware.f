20100508 00:15:48 nbsp Normally I would take this opportunity to welcome you to the wiki.  Based on your one edit here, however, thats not going to happen.  I deleted your comment from the AT&T Wireless page.  It was extremely inappropriate and not far from giving rise to a defamation suit.  You dont want that, and the wiki doesnt want to be associated with that.  If you honestly have reason to believe someone is a drug dealer, you should contact DPD about it.  Regardless, that kind of crap has no place here.
