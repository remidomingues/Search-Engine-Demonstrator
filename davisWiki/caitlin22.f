Youve already chosen your Importance of using your RealName username, so the next step would be to introduce yourself and make some positive contributions like adding business reviews, Photo Requests uploading photos, or adding to Seed Pages List pages that need more information.

20100629 16:05:31 nbsp Removing the same IP notice didnt work last time. I suggest trying something else. Once other editors see you as a real person with identity then maybe removing that tag would work. Users/JasonAller

20100629 18:40:33 nbsp Yes I am wondering how to fix this. My mother is Sharon 22 and we both use the same internet connection @ the house. DO you know of a way to fix this message. I would hate for this to have any negative effects on Soon:( Please help me fix this problem.  Users/caitlin22

20100629 18:47:16 nbsp Caitlin, a great way to address it is for you and your mother to simply establish an identity, as Jason mentioned.  Introduce yourself, make some edits on other pages, and so on, and the identity you develop will lend a lot of weight to your words.

And as Jason said, welcome to the wiki! Users/TomGarberson
