20100524 08:08:58 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Welcome to the Community Wiki for Davis. Please read Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner. You might also want to read Identity as both you and Users/DavisCritics suffer from a lack of it. Users/JasonAller

20100525 10:20:19 nbsp As Jason said, welcome to the wiki.  I agree that there are some out of whack restaurant reviews around... but its also true that readers can generally differentiate between honest evaluations and BS.  Anyway, I hope youll stick around and continue editing!  Its also worth introducing yourself here to, as Jason said, establish an identity. Users/TomGarberson

20100525 15:41:24 nbsp it does seem a little odd that the only edits youve made are in response to ketmo yet say you arent an employee...maybe there are other places in davis youd like to contribute about on the wiki? Users/OliviaY

20100525 16:47:23 nbsp Are you an owner, perhaps? Users/IDoNotExist
