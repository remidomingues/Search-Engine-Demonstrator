Cambridge Houses ISP, ApartmentHost, knows that they cant handle any real internet traffic at all and thus they throttle the hell out of anyone file sharing. Given that, it wouldnt surprise me overmuch to hear that they outright block torrenting. As I dont use torrents, I cant say I have any experience with it, but, again, it wouldnt surprise me to hear they block it. Users/RobertM525
