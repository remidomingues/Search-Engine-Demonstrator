20090723 22:02:17 nbsp  Hi, and welcome to the Wiki! Thanks for adding photos to the Primero Grove page. I reverted back the original 2005 photo. We try to retain old photos on pages for historical reference. By reverting it, the other photo you added was deleted because it was named the same as the original primerogrove.jpg. You can add it back to the page, just name it something different. To minimize large photos, you can use the sizing code (e.g. 300 and the term thumbnail).  Users/robinlaughlin
