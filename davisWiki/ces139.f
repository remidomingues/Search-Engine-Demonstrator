20080905 14:48:13 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy, Ms. or Mr. 139, and Welcome to the Wiki!   You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you (or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here).  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for all the reviews.  It would be great if you could explain what you did with the Summer Sessions Summer Abroad program and why it was so great.  In fact, if you know much about the program, it might make sense to just go ahead and make a Summer Abroad entry for it!  Anyway, welcome to the wiki! Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
