20090707 03:15:02 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy and Welcome to the Wiki!    My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Other editors are removing your edits because they... well, quite frankly, they look and smell like spam.  Spamming isnt nice... its basically like going down to your local community park and spray painting your link on the slide.  Somebody has to clean it up, and its just hurting your neighbors.  Not a nice thing to do at all. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20090707 00:22:06 nbsp Also, please dont create sockpuppet multiple accounts.  Youre a person, and you are actually quite welcome here... but act like a neighbor, not like somebody trying to squeeze every advantage out of the volunteer work of the people you live next to.  Try being yourself, not an invented Users/Davissushi.blogspot.com advertising gimmick.  Users/JabberWokky
