20100215 15:42:17 nbsp  Welcome to the Wiki. Please read Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner; it will help explain how you can make the wiki a positive experience for you without clashing with established wiki social norms. Users/JasonAller

20100215 16:43:39 nbsp Have your read that welcome page? Users/JasonAller

20100216 14:58:28 nbsp Hi Jason. I have read the welcome page Users/chernandez

20100219 14:30:38 nbsp The first thing to do is not refer to it as your page. No one owns that page and William has as much right to edit it as you do. Given that he makes contributions to many pages and isnt just here because of financial interest he will almost certainly garner more deference from other editors. Users/JasonAller

20100219 15:10:16 nbsp I dont know why you feel like you can just change the layout of our page. We take time to make these changes, and dont appreciate you changing picture sizes.

The page is my page as much as it is your page. This belongs to the community. Davis Wiki is not a business listing site with reviews. It is here to document the city of Davis, not provide you advertising. Did you know that Davis Wiki is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit? Because we have this status, were actually prohibited from promoting businesses. Your rewrites, regardless of the time you have spent on them, make the page look more promotional and endanger our taxexempt status. I dont appreciate you doing this for your own financial gain or that of your employer.

Feel free to make whatever comments you prefer, and I will post an explanation.

While most editors only feel comfortable contributing to this site through comments, everyone has the ability to edit everything. I am not going to limit my contributions solely to comments.

I understant that Wiki is an open forum, but I dont appreciate you posting incorrect information.

I am just reposting information you have removed without discussion. If something is incorrect, let us know. But just removing negative information without justification looks bad and such actions will be almost immediately undone.

20100219 15:12:45 nbsp Hi Mr./Mrs. Hernandez, I just wanted to offer one observation Ive made over the past couple of months, since I became more active on the wiki.  One frequent sticking point when it comes to business pages is the perception that its the businesss page.  The goal of the wiki, however, is to provide pages about a business.  The intent is to provide the full range of relevant information about the business, from the owner/managers perspective to clients/tenants opinions to miscellaneous and often tangential information that editors think might prove useful to other wiki users.  None of these facts is limited to appearing in the main text or the comments of a page.  Pages that read too much like an advertisement or a flyer tend not to be very appealing, as they represent primarily or solely the owner/managers viewpoint.

If you follow the Recent Changes page, youll often notice people deglossing pages or noting that a page is too glossy, referring to glossy advertisements.  In my opinion, the La Salle page wasnt all that glossy with your http://daviswiki.org/La_Salle?actionrecall&version117 original layout, although I dont think the rental agreement really belongs there.  The thing that stands out to me is that Williams http://daviswiki.org/La_Salle?actionrecall&version116 version has a cleaner layout, is easier to read, and is more appealing to the viewer.

One final note: once there is significant backandforth over a page, its well worth talking about any major changes (especially ones resembling reversions, or ones removing information) before making them in order explain why youre doing what youre doing, and hopefully figure out if and why people have an issue with them.  There have been a few reverts here, so Id say La Salle qualifies. Users/TomGarberson

20100219 18:09:44 nbsp Please explain why you think the things youre removing need to be removed, and the things youre altering need to be altered, on the La Salle/Talk talk page.  If youre not willing to discuss it, chances are itll just keep getting reverted. Users/TomGarberson

20100219 18:19:40 nbsp Please reread Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner. Simply declaring the wishes of management that a page be a certain way doesnt help you at all. This is a community. Again, youre just another editor. If you have any specific issues about La Salle, please post them over at La Salle/Talk. Were already discussing the deposit issue that you posted on my page and wed love your input. Users/WilliamLewis

20100219 22:22:52 nbsp Again, if you have any specific issues with La Salle, please post them at La Salle/Talk. You have given no reasons for the edits you have made when they are clearly a step backwards in formatting and content.  Users/WilliamLewis

20100220 11:15:54 nbsp Hi chernandez.  Wondering if you could post something regarding pet policies on the La Salle page.  Might be useful for prospective renters.  Cats? Dogs? Hampsters?  Pet deposit?  Let us know. Users/jefftolentino

20100222 09:58:48 nbsp The page is looking good.  Thanks for the pet policy info, thats definitely useful for readers and potential residents! Users/TomGarberson

20111216 13:36:47 nbsp Carlos is awesome Users/StevenDaubert
