Chill Tree is the creation of local artist Emily Earlenbaugh; who believes that art feeds the soul, and the people are hungry.

Emily has been making personalized art and jewelry since she was a child, and loves to empower people by showing them reflections of themselves in art.

The mission at Chill Tree is to create affordable art and magical items for your lifeâ€™s journey. This is why we started offering Art by Donations: At Chill Tree we see artmaking as a community service. We want everyone to have access to the experience of personalized art, so instead of listing prices, we list the cost of the materials and the time spent. You decide the donation.
