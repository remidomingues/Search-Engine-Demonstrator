20100412 20:53:39 nbsp Hi!  Thanks for adding the page about environmental justice.  I wanted to let you know that I changed the name of the page to UC Davis Environmental Justice Project to better reflect the name of the group.  I also did some basic cleanup on the page and added some links.  Looks like a great project! Users/CovertProfessor
