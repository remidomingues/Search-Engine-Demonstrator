Hi, Im Christopher Hagerman, senior Neuroscience, Physiology, and Behavior major at UC Davis and outgoing community service chair for the California Epsilon chapter of Phi Delta Theta. I race sailboats offshore and am an avid hiker, fisher, and kayaker. I am always on the lookout for new community service projects for my brothers, so feel free to contact me if you have information or know of a good opportunity for us to give back to the community we appreciate being in.
