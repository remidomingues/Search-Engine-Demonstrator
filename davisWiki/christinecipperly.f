Christine Cipperly is mostly known for embarrassing her children and should not say anything further.


Howdy, Christine, and welcome to the wiki!  The best thing about embarrassing kids (in a good way) is that those are the memories of childhood theyll treasure most when they arent kids anymore.  Of course, as a grown man, my mom can still whip out a few photos and old old stories that would embarrass me, only I think I lost all my shame in the laundry sometime in my 20s.... it probably went where the lost socks go.  ;)  Fantastic info about the brickwork in the Mystery Picture by the way: thats the kind of neat little details and stories that make the wiki fun!
