Profile
I am an engineering student at the University of California Davis. I am currently the Team Captain of the Davis Sailing Team. I am a US Sailing Level I instructor and am willing to give private sailing lessons to anyone who is interested. I am also doing welding gigs. I can provide a cheap and fast service for a fraction of the cost of a professional. I specialize at repairing mufflers starting from $40. Please send me and email if you are interested.

1969 Honda SL 350. I got the bike for $150, and am trying to get her back on the road, or at least trails. I am a brake job and muffler (got a set of aftermarket mufflers on ebay) short of making this happen besides a few minor details.

20100428 05:19:04 nbsp Great bike!  I like the more classic lines on the old original dirtbikes.  Id love to see a shot of the centerline (from behind the bike, looking over the top of the bike) to see what the width feels like.  1969 is the original year, correct? Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards  (Just found http://motorbikearchives.com/BikeTests/Trail/HondaSL3501969.html this article, which Im sure youve seen, but is a good read for anybody else)

20100429 00:53:56 nbsp Yep. You are correct, she is a 1969 Honda SL 350. Hopefully with some time she will be on the streets and trails soon. I will work on more photos soon.  Users/cityfrontsailor

20100720 02:51:35 nbsp You may want to bear in mind that the wiki page about your business is not your website.  Many people who are relatively new to the wiki think that by creating a page that makes it their property, however the wiki is community run and that means that anything you contribute is the property of the community as a whole (it is looked down upon, and often prevented for you to delete negative comments for example).  I would recommend getting an outside website as well that you can have full control over.  By no means do you have to, its just Ive seen many people who just dont get the idea of community property pertaining to the things that they contribute.  Users/MasonMurray

20100720 08:04:24 nbsp Not sure how formal youve gone with the welding business, but if you havent already, I strongly suggest getting liability insurance. Users/TomGarberson

20100720 08:36:03 nbsp Many many years ago I used to race Laser class myself.  Fun as heck.   One of the things Id like to get in the future is a nice slow, small and simple day sailer for minimal camping (a la motorcycle camping).  Good luck with your welding service... did you see the note about the new car club in town? Users/JabberWokky

20100720 18:49:31 nbsp Mason I know that it is not my very own website that I have control over, but it is free adversing so I can get my informal service out there. I just want a place where I can post some photos of my work, psot my prices, contact info, and try to get new business. Thanks.

Tom I am doing a very informal welding gig. I dont plan on doing anything out of the scope of my abilities, but I will look into getting some in the future. Thanks for the advise.

JabberWokky You should get back into it. There is a thursday evening race series at Lake Washington. It is pretty fun casual race. Users/cityfrontsailor
