I see that youve updated the Merryhill School page to add various programs that you host and to note that the school now only offers education through grade 6. In case you were unaware, http://davis.merryhillschool.com/page.cfm?p11110 the schools website needs to be updated because it still makes reference to 8th grade in some places. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Happy editing! Users/WilliamLewis
