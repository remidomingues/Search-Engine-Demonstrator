20070706 19:26 nbsp Sir, if you read the information about how the Davis Wiki works, such as the business owner page mentioned above, you will see why other wiki users keep restoring the information that you remove. You would only have total control of the information given on your business own website. Users/LillianChow

20080306 19:56:56 nbsp Hi there, I saw the http://daviswiki.org/Soga%27s?actiondiff&version2173&version1172 changes you made to Sogas Sogas hours. Can I ask how the new hours are different, and when dinner is no longer served? I ask because I have wanted to dine at Sogas in the evening in the past, but havent known when dinner ends and the nightclub hours begin.  Users/ElleWeber
