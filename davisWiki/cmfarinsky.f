20090920 17:57:02 nbsp Hi there. Welcome to the Wiki! It appears that you may be trying to add personal images to your user page (this page) or to a new business page yet to be created, but accidentally added them to the templates/business page. You might find the wiki:wikispot:Help_with_Images Help With Images useful. Cheers. Users/robinlaughlin

20090920 18:10:42 nbsp Hi, Cassie. I created a new page for your business and transferred over all the info that was accidentally added to the templates/business page. You can now add the photos and edit page content to the new page: Kidaroo Playcare. Users/robinlaughlin
