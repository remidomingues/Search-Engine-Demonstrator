20071025 17:25:47 nbsp Good call on the currently edit. And funny you should mention wings I just ate a chain called Wing Stop in the East Bay. Their hot wings are passable, but they have a few other varieties that sound interesting too. Have you had Sudwerks wings lately? They used to be decent but were inexplicably limited to the drumette.  Users/CraigBrozinsky
