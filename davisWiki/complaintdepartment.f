20100627 12:20:58 nbsp Do you work for TAPS? If so, using this account might put TAPS in a negative light. Also, the account name is very confusing as well. Some might mistake you as the complaint department for the Wiki. Users/hankim

20100627 14:29:12 nbsp I have a complaint.  If you work for TAPS as it is safe to assume otherwise you would not be able to substantiate that Miss Roads is not using her Real Name.  I got a parking ticket in 2008 on my Jeep and paid it.  I dont drive that car anymore, but I need to renew the registration now in order to sell it and I cant because it has an overdue parking ticket on it.  Please correct this error.  Thank you.

20100628 04:07:33 nbsp I had a similar challenge. You can call the issuing agency and request documentation. Are you saying you paid for a ticket and they believe you still owe them money? Users/complaintdepartment

20100628 05:12:01 nbsp I have neighbors who strew trash on their lawns.  Can you do anything about that? Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20100719 16:46:29 nbsp I have a complaint: there are a handful of users who create usernames with officialsounding titles that seem to imply that they represent real organizations, even though those accounts are being used as personal accounts, or by individuals who do not represent the organization. Beyond that, these accounts dont have any accountability, since they are not using their own identity. Could you fix that? Users/JoePomidor
