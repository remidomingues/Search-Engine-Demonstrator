20091108 11:53:56 nbsp Why remove the founding date from Mojo Flow Studio? Users/JasonAller

20091108 12:07:04 nbsp Removing other users comments from business entries has generally been agreed upon as a bad thing by the Wiki Community. Users/JasonAller

20091108 13:28:57 nbsp You may be a minimalist, but were mostly information junkies. Stuff like founding dates and such are important to us. Were not really a business listing site, in case there has been any confusion. Were a resource on Davis and businesses are part of Davis. We also have pages on Town History, Arthur Shapiro interesting local residents, Bicycling, and much much more. Dont think of Mojo Flow Studio as an ad that is short, snappy, and intended to drive business to you. Think of it as a community view of what your business is and what it offers.  Users/WilliamLewis

20091108 14:05:08 nbsp Hey, looks like you got off to a rough start at first.  There are a couple things that might help you understand where everybody is coming from.  First off, the entry about Mojo Flow Studio isnt your entry.  Its part of the project to document Davis, including the studio (since the studio is part of Davis).  This isnt a business listings site, its a community project to document all the aspects of the Davis community, including (but not limited to) businesses.  Thus, neat little things like what business used to be in that location or when it was established, how the building was renovated, if the business sponsored a car in the Dixon May Fair Demolition Derby... all those neat little details are part of that effort.  In fact, old businesses that havent been around for many years (and past Police Chiefs, old road plans, information about the involvement Davis had in WWII)... all of those are part of the community of Davis and thus documented on the wiki.  That said, theres plenty of opportunity to add quite a bit of currently relevant information to the entry that would be of use to people considering going to Mojo Flow.  The entry is written by the community, and youre part of the community.  Welcome to the wiki! Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, (814) 8898845

20091108 14:07:04 nbsp RE: searching for fitness There are a lot of fitnessrelated pages here.  If I search for fitness I see the page Gyms & Fitness at the top.  Most people would click on that and find the Mojo page, which is linked from there. Users/PhilipNeustrom

20100105 15:16:18 nbsp Maybe you can explain on the pages that those classes arent offered anymore? You might also be able to move some of the information to the studio page and delete the other pages. Be sure to explain the history of it all on whatever page remains though. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20100105 18:02:10 nbsp I moved your question you posted at Davis Wiki Oracle to Wiki Community/General Discussion, a more appropriate place where more people will see it. Users/WilliamLewis

20100105 21:10:46 nbsp A line like {{{  Looking to get fit? Davis offers many Gyms & Fitness gyms and fitness centers!}}} is called a link back. It is intended to appear on all of the pages that are linked from the topic page, in this case Gyms & Fitness. Removing it lessen the value of having a page about Gyms & Fitness and makes it harder for people to navigate around the larger topic of Gyms & Fitness. Generally these link backs are inserted right before the comment macro so that they dont disrupt the content of the entry. Users/JasonAller

20100723 10:37:07 nbsp Just to let you know, I made a few changes to the Pilates Flow Fitness page.  It was extremely promotional, with more and more links to the forprofit website.  If you havent done so yet, please read over the Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner page for why thats a problem. Users/TomGarberson

20100919 13:33:53 nbsp I added the macro {{{Include(NoLongerExists)}}} to the Moms in Motion page so that there is now a banner at the top that reads, The subject of this entry no longer exists in Davis or is a former version. All information here is for historical reference only.  No one wants to confuse people; theyre just trying to document things about Davis, past and present. Users/CovertProfessor

20100919 14:08:27 nbsp Who is the wiki?  Youre as empowered as anybody else here.  If you notice something wrong, keep in mind it was added by an actual living person out of the kindness of their heart.  Its a bit thoughtless to walk into a open picnic where everybody brought food from their homes and are sharing it with all their neighbors and then start complaining I wish the picnic wasnt such a lousy cook.  There is no the picnic, in the same way theres no the wiki.  Its a bunch of neighbors sharing with each other.  Specific to your complaint, its quite easy to delete an entry  everybody (including you) can do it to any entry on the wiki (even the Front Page).  Hit edit and then the Delete button.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
  Of course (to continue JWs analogy), if you start to throw someones dish in the trash, they might not be too happy with you and will probably try to rescue it.   Users/CovertProfessor
   I think crpikes point was maybe that the moms in motion page was never fully cooked to begin with because we never really knew what it was, having never actually amounted to anything. If we should do anything differently about this problem, maybe we could have a page for flyers and stuff, that we hope to turn into better pages someday instead of making a seed page. I think most of the time the seed pages work ok though, so Im ok with either approach. I think we should be more welcoming of crpikes information about what happened to moms in motion though, instead of criticizing them for not editing the page. Users/NickSchmalenberger
    Oh, I am very happy to have crpikes information on the page  it tells a more complete story of what happened.  I didnt mean to criticize crpike for not editing the page, but rather try to explain how a page could be edited to show that the information was no longer current instead of just deleting the page.  What I reacted negatively to was the part that said, I wish the Wiki was a little more careful before creating new pages like this. Now there is no way of removing it. It has probably wasted quite a few peoples time.  I dont see the problem with documenting peoples attempts  even failed attempts  to start up endeavors in Davis.  Of course, then all of us are on the hook to keep such pages updated and to note when they are out of date, and crpike started that process; I tried to help out with it.   Users/CovertProfessor
 Yeah, I agree but I think we shouldnt be too defensive. The edit/comment nitpick also bothers me, its a wiki after all so we can integrate it cooperatively as you did very well. Maybe we should also say something on such pages like, I saw this flyer one day, has anybody gone to one of these classes? That way it might help explain that its just some flyer. crpikes concern sounds legitimate to me, even if the way they said it doesnt take as much responsibility for it as would be nice :( Users/NickSchmalenberger

20120312 15:23:52 nbsp That might well be.  I got an email from one of the instructors there, though, saying that the info was an unauthorized copy and was out of date.  Kinda weird for a student to do that without contacting the people at the studio. Users/TomGarberson

20120515 21:09:56 nbsp Hey, somehow I missed your comment to me.  I renamed the page and edited the entry to note the name change.  A renamed page will redirect to the new one.  Im going to update the links now.  I like the way the new name rolls off the tongue. Users/JabberWokky

20131216 17:27:47 nbsp last I checked 2014 hasnt happened yet. Did ASUCD suspend EC in 13? shady Also Yelp salesmen point to the slowing of the wiki as a silly selling point for yelp advertisement.

Alot of the regulars have been chased away, not that many people feel comfortable unlerking, especially with the naming convention of real names and everyone being too scared of their future to share in the today   Users/StevenDaubert

20131219 14:24:44 nbsp Davis WIki has a BoD as well as local wiki. They have a wiki. You can always ask Philbo about these things he is happy to point you in the right direction Users/StevenDaubert
