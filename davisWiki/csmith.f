Describe Users/csmith here.
Well it looks as if I have a pet peeve with horrible customer service seeing how I have left very negative reviews comments for almost everyplace in Davis, but I really think that feedback can be useful (maybe?). Thanks to davis wiki I have a new fascination with the Campus Crusade for Chaos and Confusion CCCC (some group on campus about Chaos and Confusion idk the full name) going around and posting Mass Posterings those crazy signs around campus~I love it! And cheers to this sexy bookstore employee for working everyday that I just so happen to stop in, in order to buy some random thing that I thought was necessary. Well thats enough about silly ol me.
