20100828 14:48:33 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Couldnt help but notice your attention to detail and the fact that you do kind of stand out by making a followup comment about one of the apartments you have lived in after initially moving in (very few actually do this). It just stood out, but the Welcome is long overdue, as is perhaps making your imprint on the Wiki even deeper by perhaps fleshing out your user page a bit. Enjoy and have fun. Users/WesP
