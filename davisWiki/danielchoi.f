20110114 11:32:50 nbsp Hey, if its only a single year archived, just name it by that year.  The only reason its named Pre 2009 is because it also includes reviews from 2007, 2008, etc.  Typically, reviews are archived by calendar year one year after the whole year has gone by.  But only if it makes sense  if there are a ton of reviews on the entry, for instance.  Like most things on the wiki (and many things off the wiki, like standing in a line or choosing who pays for dinner), its a tradition that seems to work well. Theres no hard rule: its something editors make judgement calls on. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, jw.dw@timewarp.org
