20110413 14:06:07 nbsp Hi Dave, and Welcome to the Wiki!  Take a moment to look over the Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner business owner welcome pagetheres a lot of very useful info there.  I touched up the table on your new page a little bithopefully it looks OK.  Thanks for adding your business to the wiki!  You can write up a blurb about Paintings by Dave there, and maybe include some info about the artist (yourself).  One great thing about the wiki is learning a bit about the local folks we meet and/or do business with.  See that business owner welcome page for tips on how it should lookit should be informational in nature, so it reads as being information about you and the business, rather than from you and the business.  The next step would be to link your business from some related pages, and to add links to related stuff on the Paintings by Dave page.  For example, if its an art studio, you might want to add a link (preferably in alphabetical order) to the Art page.  Its quite easy to do  just hit the edit button at the top of that page, find the right area, and add in {{{  Paintings by Dave}}}.  Other pages that might be relevant include Art Galleries, E Street, and Downtown. Users/TomGarberson
