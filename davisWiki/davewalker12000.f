Hey Dave.  I saw you removed the line about making sure that youre aware who is responsible (property management or the tenants) for various city service fees.  I readded it (and a bit about lawn care), because it seems like that is an important thing to be aware of when signing a lease.  Maybe I missed something: was there a reason thats not obvious to remove it?  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
