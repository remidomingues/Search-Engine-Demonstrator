20111111 11:07:19 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki.  I restored the information you deleted from the AEPi webpage.  Please see the Welcome to the Wiki/Organization organization rep intro page.  Deleting information is kind of a nono around here. Users/TomGarberson

20111114 13:24:28 nbsp As Im sure you know, the info youre deleting from the Alpha Epsilon Pi was on the front page of the Davis Enterprise and is still on their website http://www.davisenterprise.com/localnews/crimefirecourts/gradsuesucdforfailingtorespondtohazing/ here.  So, its not exactly a secret, and its also not clear why you expect info to be deleted from the wiki when the same thing would not happen at the Enterprise.  If you have more information to add, or to offer a different perspective, that would be welcome.  Deleting the info just isnt go to fly here, though. Users/CovertProfessor

20111115 14:07:12 nbsp You have been asked nicely to not whitewash the AEPi page. Now Im going to tell you not so nicely. STOP DELETING SHIT. Users/MeggoWaffle

20111117 15:45:47 nbsp Hey Im sorry for deleting the messages. Obviously, Im not very savvy on this website and I didnt even know I had this type of chat profile thing. I did move it to the bottom of the page but I didnt delete any of the information, I hope thats okay.  Once again, my apologies. Users/davidrosove
