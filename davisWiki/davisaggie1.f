I am a current UC Student.

I have found the Davis Wiki to be a great resource during my stay in Davis. Though, I have never contributed to it before. I am glad that I have been able to do a couple positive things for the website.
I hope to help improve upon something that has definitely been a vital resource to the Davis community.



Thanks


20110820 13:36:01 nbsp Welcome to the wiki, and thank you for your contributions.  I see you have the same IP address as Users/DavisVanguard.  Are you the same person? Users/CovertProfessor

20110820 13:39:34 nbsp I am interning right now, but yeah. Sorry for the previous account additions. I misunderstood some of my job duties. I was just trying to show some of the stories that were relevant to some of the wikis; however, I didnt follow the right format. I apologize for that, I didnt mean to spam.  Users/davisaggie1

20110820 13:42:39 nbsp Ok, thanks.  Sometimes it takes people a little while to get the hang of things  weve all been through it!  Im glad to see you making other sorts of edits, too.  And its OK to link to the Vanguard articles (I do it myself pretty often) as long as its done in an informational way and not as a way to promote the Vanguard. Users/CovertProfessor

20110820 13:45:55 nbsp Thanks for the help! Yeah, I am used to the way I deal with my Facebook pages. Which are all about promotion, so I guess I was doing it with my article suggestions out of habit.
Despite being an intern, I do not personally represent the Vanguards platform in any way. I just focus on adding articles that are relevant to what is happening in the community. So, I dont share the opinions or views, for all that are concerned with that issue. I am just a messenger. Users/davisaggie1
