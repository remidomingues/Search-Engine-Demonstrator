This Locally Owned Websites website is a local classified posting site for contractors and do it yourselfers.  Most of the items here are free because they are left over from construction jobs and the posters would rather see them recycled than go into a landfill.  All items are local to Davis so you dont have to drive far to get your goods.


There is also a section with tips and advice from professionals.


Users can post questions and are notified when they receive a reply from an expert.
