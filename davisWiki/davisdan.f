Dan the man...as referred to by my friends.

I am an engineering student here at Davis, with not too much time on my hands.
I have family in wiki:sacramento Sacto and visit when I can.

I like to have fun with friends Sam, Mark and Ben.  They wish they could beat me at poker.  BRING IT ON.

I will try and update this page with more details in the future.
