Davisfixed is a community of local cyclists that have a shared interest in fixed gear bicycles. It began in the spring of 2007 as a small group of fixed gear cyclists who needed a way to communicate with each other about rides, bikes, and events. Out of such necessity, an internet forum was born (http://www.davisfixed.com/).

The group has since grown into a much larger community of cyclists who enjoy bicycles of all types (not just fixed gears). The group is not a real club, and there are no official members. It is merely a bunch of people who enjoy bicycles, and hang out with others who have the same interests.

Rides and events are often arranged via the forum, and further information about the group can be found there.
