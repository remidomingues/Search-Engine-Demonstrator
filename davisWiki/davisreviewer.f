20090605 18:58:04 nbsp  Welcome to the Wiki. Please consider the importance of using your RealName, because using your real name is a way to acknowledge that this is a Wiki Community community. If you dont want to use your real name at least introduce yourself. Users/JasonAller

20090616 21:00:50 nbsp I prefer anonymity, Ill be around for a while, some comments may seem controversial from time to time and Id rather not have to deal with the consequences of completely free webexpression in real life. Users/davisreviewer
  20090617 07:23:26 nbsp I have to give you credit for being honest about your intentions even if I do not agree with them. I think youll find the amount of feedback youll get over your name to be out of proportion with other anonymous names because of the particular name you choose. Davis Reviewer has several issues. Starting a name with Davis is redundant for the Davis Wiki and somewhat limits your participation on other Wiki Spot wikis like wiki:Woodland. Reviewer implies a certain claim on the word as a title rather than a description. Combine those with your stated intention to make controversial comments that you dont feel comfortable backing up with your real name and rankles those who came here and have stood behind their words with their name. Another similar name was Davis Resident which always makes me react, What, like Im not a resident of Davis?. That claim of exclusivity to what reads more like a title rather than a name seems offputting.
 This is a Wiki Community community. Several of us are working hard to get past the acrimony and crap that gets added in the form of business reviews and look at the Wiki as a means of communication, documentation and a tool to help improve this town. No other community has as healthy a Wiki or has done as good a job of documenting the especially the little, enjoyable things. Some of us find links that need to be made, others fact check phone numbers and business hours. Some are photographers, others writers or explorers. We try to reach out to the masked individuals here and let them know that this isnt one of the shadowy corners of the internet, but an extension of the town. Behavior counts here. Users/JasonAller

20090616 21:40:50 nbsp Just realize that many people may not take your davis reviews as seriously if youre not willing to stand behind your statements with your name. Users/WesHardaker

20090616 22:02:35 nbsp But youre willing to bring those consequences to others.  Thanks man. Users/BrentLaabs
    Ive had restaurant waiters at places I frequented recognize me when I paid with my credit card, and even comment to me Oh, youre on DavisWiki when I used my real name.  Thats not something I want, and I bet thats not something other people want either.  It made me feel uncomfortable when I went there again.  If I had said something like the servers are awful, the water service too slow, and I waited for the bill too long, that very well could be controversial comments.  Thankfully, I had said the place was great (and I suppose it could be a good thing, perhaps the waiter would have tossed me free dessert or something to boost a review? heh).  But ultimately, reviews are certainly things I do not want any establishment to associate with my person. The assumption that people might want some anonymity from their comments isnt ridiculous at all. What if a professor on the wiki wants to critize a course, or let loose some of their political beliefs?  There was a recent case of a political blogger outed to be a professor of law, and it surely affected his professional career.  The wiki does engage in such debates, be it abortion, gun control, or things like Covell village.  The notion that we should only use our real names ever because anything else is horrible would be fine, if all we were willing to post about were rainbows, puppies and sunshine.  Im of the belief that people will be more honest and open when they feel safe doing so, which would involve posting under an alias.  Sure, you also get a lot of people coming in with all caps insults, and thatll always happen regardless of whats done. (Its the internet, baby. People also used to leave those comments in the suggestion boxes of the dining commons. You dont take them seriously, and move on).  But to assume that is a general characteristic of people who wear ski masks to the farmers market and how 95% of nonrealname users make jerk edits or whatever that stupid pie chart said goes beyond unfair and is in my view rather unwelcoming to new users, and unrealistic in terms of topics and the reach of the wiki. users/edwins ES

20090730 18:46:10 nbsp To Jason. Ill claim reviewer because no one else has. Welcome to the internets, its serious business.
To Wes. More power to them, where they choose to spend their money and time is of no importance to me.
To Brent. Think before typing.
To ES. The first comment that fully makes sense.

If people are going to act like this just because I choose a name I prefer it should be no wonder why Id prefer anonymity. With reactions like this I wouldnt be surprised if someone tossed a Molotov into my car for correcting a pricing typo. Users/davisreviewer
  Welcome to a community of neighbors.  Its just downright odd when somebody uses a pseudonym among the real people living around you.  Believe me, I know.  :)  Its okay, of course, but it is like somebody walking into a community block party, saying yeah, I live down the street... call me Street Dweller.  This isnt the internet at large, its a tiny corner.  Youre not alone in using a pseudonym here, just a rarity.  You can expect some odd looks, just as youd get at the block party if you introduced yourself as Street Dweller.  Stick around and itll blow over, but it will be somewhat odd when you talk to people around town face to face, something that is less likely on the internet at large.  (People often feel weird when they call me JabberWokky, but thats a old theater nickname that predates the world wide web, and Im comfortable with either that or Evan in real life).  To each their own, of course.  Id offer you a Molotov cocktail, minus the rag, plus a cherry on a toothpick, if I had one.  Welcome to the Wiki!  wiki:gnome:Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20090803 18:08:24 nbsp I dont plan to walk around Davis introducing myself with conversation about my posts on daviswiki so I guess I wont have any problems. Theres not much else to say, and making anymore conversation on the topic is pretty much pointless.Users/davisreviewer
