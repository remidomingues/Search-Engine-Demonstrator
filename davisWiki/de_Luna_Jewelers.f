In the 1970s, there was a restaurant called The Lantern located just west of this location. It sold hamburgers and pizza.

On January 31, 2013, de Luna Jewelers was the victim of some despicable acts of vandalism and theft.  At 2:40 AM several men broke their window in the midst of a fight, then fled the scene.  At 3:13 AM two other men stole items from the open window.  Then at 3:20 AM two men and three women took more items.  Finally someone walking their dog called the police (in total, seven groups passed the window before the call was made).  Among the losses are Native American pottery and Hopi Kachina dolls.  The Enterprise has more details http://www.davisenterprise.com/localnews/crimefirecourts/delunamanagerrecentcrimesshowedhugelackofmoralcompass/ here.  Anyone with information about the vandalism and thefts is asked to contact the Davis Police Department at 5307475400.

20070528 13:17:25 nbsp wonderful place. We got both our wedding rings and several other pieces of jewelry from Delunas and have always had a good experience.  Users/HeatherFlood

20070802 02:29:18 nbsp my wedding ring from here was modest but the nicest diamond my husband could find. couple years ago I brought my ring back because the diamond was chipped. the jeweler there advised a change in the setting to look better, which I was a little reluctant about because the original setting was specifically advised to be very secure, important for my job. he assured me the change would not be a problem. 2 weeks after I got my ring back I looked at my ring and the diamond was gone  it had fallen out. we went back and told them what happened. the owner said he was sorry, but he would not replace my diamond. the owner offered another diamond at below retail so my husband bought that, but I dont wear my ring anymore because of the memory it evokes. Users/ellie

20070804 15:31:48 nbsp We brought a wedding ring that we had purchased from a different jewelry store to have it appraised and sized.  The employee my fiance dropped it off with told him it would take a week.  It has been over two weeks now, and each time we call, the woman who answers the phone is very evasive and extremely unapologetic about the delay.  I felt that we are being dismissed because we are younger customers.  Users/susanne

20070905 14:59:40 nbsp Had a tensiontype ring resized there and it took over a month to get back.  When i did get it back it was the wrong size and I had to take it back again.  Needless to say but Im still waiting on it.  So slow...ugh. Users/Miley

20080122 15:19:51 nbsp My fiance and I went to DeLunas to design my wedding ring back in July 07.  We came to them with specific needs for a rare stone, in place of a traditional centered diamond, and they were so great at locating it for us.  They dug around with other resources and found a few in Japan for us to pick from (very rare).  They were very quick about it and have waited on us hand and foot ever since.  The only thing Id change, is I wish they would have given us a bit more of their personal input about their expertise concerning the stone.  They were very friendly, timely, fare priced, and gave a beautiful, high quality product. Users/Sierra

20080202 15:50:41 nbsp Ive purchased a watch here, as well as a necklace for my girlfriend, and eventually I bought both an engagement ring and two wedding bands for that same girlfriend at DeLunas. The staff is amazing: Ive experienced smalltown customer service before, but their sales staff is awesome! I still go in just to say hi and get my wifes ring shined! I seriously dont go anywhere else now. Users/dlacy

20081107 00:01:15 nbsp I have brought 3 pieces of jewerly here for repair on 3 seperate occasions. good prices, good work, and trustworthy. i havent bought anything, but they do a nice job in repairing jewelry. :) Users/ascapoccia

20090605 08:20:09 nbsp This is by far the best jeweler I could find.  I tried all online stores and major jewelers and local ones around Sac, SF, LA, SanJo.  I regret getting my diamond elsewhere.  They do their best to help you find what customers need.  They have the very best people working there and their prices are amazing.  They do custom work for excellent price.  I got my fiancees diamond mounted on a custommade setting.  Mr. Luna and his wife are the very best jewelers.  Dont waste your time online or in Zales, Shanes, Tiffanys, etc.  If you have questions go directly to them and youll see how great they are.  You can even contact me and hear from me why you SHOULD buy from them and do business with them.  They repair, sell, fix, etc.  They have a great selection of other items besides their beautiful jewelry.  Check their websites and visit the store before you keep looking for jewelry!

20090721 11:43:05 nbsp I recently had my wedding band and engagement ring soldered together and couldnt be happier with the work done by DeLunas. Jeweller Seans work was meticulous and he even aligned the inscription on the inside of my wedding band with the top of my engagement ring (allowing me to have the ring enlarged later if needed, without affecting the inscription). The soldering is seamless on the inside surface of the rings yet the outer curved surfaces are intact  they look separate but are cleanly joined. The fit was not changed in the soldering process and my rings were returned to me in spotless condition  they had been cleaned and buffed to remove accumulated scratches from the years. The sales and service staff were polite and knowledgeable each time I spoke with them. I wouldnt hesitate to recommend DeLunas to my friends. Users/AG

20100222 13:55:32 nbsp I had my wifes wedding ring repaired here.  I made it while in dental school and it was just too thin so it cracked.  The crack was right next to the stone so I was not sure how they were going to do it without damaging the stone.  The jeweler showed me they have a laser welder, very cool!!  They did a great job, shined up the ring too. The repair was very affordable ($35 for the weld only) and the customer service was friendly and kind. Users/DagonJones

20100414 15:52:17 nbsp My wife and I have had more than one unpleasant experience at de Luna. Our last visit prompted us to take action. Please see the letter copied below and our complaint with the Better Business Bureau, BBB CASE#: 65004532.

Mr. de Luna,

While shopping for wedding bands in your store on December 26th, my fiancée presented you with her late grandmothers ring and asked if you could determine its age. During your inspection you accidentally dropped the ring. Before falling to the floor it struck a display cases and one of the diamonds became dislodged and separated from the ring.

The diamond was found and considering my fiancées intention to wear the ring during our ceremony on the 28th, you offered to repair the ring by 5 PM that day with no indication that there would be a charge for the repair.

When I returned to pick up the repaired ring I was presented with a bill totaling $48 for the repair. I informed your representative that the ring required repair because it was dropped by you, and that it was my belief that the store, not us, was responsible for the damage and subsequent repair cost. She stated that, I was lucky the ring was dropped there and not somewhere else.

Our ceremony being two days away, and not having time or energy to argue with someone who obviously lacked any level of sympathy, I begrudgingly paid for the repair with my American Express card.

It goes without saying that we are extremely dissatisfied with the service we received at your store and feel that we should not have to pay for the repair that was required because of your negligence.

I writing today to request a full refund to my American Express card of the $48 paid for the repair.

I look forward to your immediate attention to this matter. Should I not receive a full refund promptly, I will initiate a dispute with American Express, file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, post my experiences with your store to daviswiki.org, and contact any associations or accrediting agencies you are affiliated with.

Sincerely,
Scott M Decker Users/ScottMDecker

20100414 19:40:16 nbsp I think its a nice store...Granted I havent been in a long time. But I do have to say that the one time I went in there as a potential customer, it was to get one of my Grandmas rings appraised. She left it to me and I was going to use it as my engagement ring. When I brought it in, I was promptly told it was worth next to nothing, then they offered to buy it. I declined, but they did clean my ring for free. Users/jsbmeb

20101221 12:45:13 nbsp My husband and I went into DeLunas a little over a week ago to start looking for a new diamond to upgrade my engagement ring. We were still in the just talking about doing this phase, but after looking at the beautiful dimonds they had in stock, I was sold in about 5 minutes! Adrian showed us 34 different stones they had that met our specs, all in an array of price ranges. He took the time to sit with us while we talked it over. Initially we walked out with nothing to give it a few days to think it over, but by Tuesday we went in and purchased it, and by Friday we had the new ring in hand. My ring needed modification for the new setting, but we basically left it up to them to do what they needed to do. In the end, I absolutely love the new setting...its exactly what I would have chosen myself. They will also honor the purchase price of the diamond should we ever want to do another upgrade. All in all, the experience was amazing and Id highly recommend DeLuna.  Users/AmLin

20110216 16:54:45 nbsp Great service and with a smile. Adrian Blanco who works there is really a gem. Had limited money with my scholarship. I gave him my budget and he went out of his way to help and finally get something together within my price limitation. More than satisfied with this great service and the warmth of this shop and its owners and workers. An unforgettable experience. Users/RajivSaxena

20111026 14:49:47 nbsp My husband first went to de Luna to purchase my engagement ring.  I had given him an idea of what I wanted, but I knew it was something that had to be custom made, so I suggested he go to de Luna since it was an independently owned store where he would get personal service.  After the proposal he told me about his experience.  The owner had worked with him personally to create a ring that was exactly what I wanted, as beautiful as my husband wanted, and was within his price range.  Since then de Luna has been our one and only jewelry store.  Over the past few years I have worked with Adrian to custom design a couple pieces of jewelry, and each time it is a wonderful experience.  I always stop by to say hello to the staff and have my jewelry looked over and cleaned.

I love coming to de Luna because not only is it a beautiful store with wonderful product, but the staff remember who you are and make you feel welcomed.  I recommend de Luna to anyone who is looking for a jeweler that they can trust and can come to for years. Users/LaurenJones

20120501 19:29:30 nbsp Unimpressed with the lack of disclosure.  I brought my nice Tissot watch in only to ask about how to open it to change the battery because I was under the impression I needed a case blade.  The woman took it back and put a new battery in it, no big deal, $5 battery after mark up, thats reasonable.  But it was a $10 watch battery.  On amazon its a $3 battery.  I would appreciate if they had told me how much the battery was before they started the repair and I would have gone and done it myself, especially since it didnt take more than a knife.  Its illegal for an auto mechanic to repair your car without giving you an estimate, is it so hard for a jeweler to do the same?  Adrian is classic salesman, this is a very nice watch, its very sensitive inside, you cant just do it yourself, blah blah blah.   Users/BrunoJohn

20120502 14:35:20 nbsp After visiting a chain store in search of a plain set of wedding bands, I stopped by DeLunas. We were turned off by the lack of customer service offered at the chain store once we said that we were not interested in gemstones. When I told the salesman at DeLunas, Stephen, what I was looking for, he was awesome.  Even though he knew up front that I was not buying anything that day and that our price range was fairly low, he took the time to explain the options.  When we came back to order them, the salesman (dont remember his name) was equally awesome.  We ended up getting exactly what we wanted for less than we expected to spend.  Probably could have gotten the same rings for $40 or so cheaper online, but I dont mind paying more for excellent customer service. Excellent customer service was what we got at DeLunas. Users/LisaBriggs

20121101 12:35:10 nbsp I came in needing a personalized gift in under a week. Stephanie Choi worked with me to make sure I got the perfect gift in short order. I am very happy with my experience here. I will recommend de Luna to anyone needing a custom engraving. Users/BenjaminPickett

20130702 23:05:49 nbsp As a college student, I was insulted by the owner. He said the bracelet I brought in was too cheap and not worth fixing. Twenty years later, I still have not stepped foot in that store. I go to Third Street Jewelers where I purchase quality jewelry from a respectful business owner! Users/JChapman

20140104 15:20:55 nbsp I went in today with about a 4K budget in mind to get stones appraised and then set in a band. I wanted to look at settings and was given a large binder by the sales associate and told I dont need to be here for this do I? Well, actually you do if you want my business. I could understand if they were busy (which they werent), but I got the distinct impression that she was not taking me seriously. Based on my customer service experience, I will probably not go back. I want to put money into the community, but do not want to support a business that hires sales associates that are dismissive.  Users/DBurkart
