20090811 19:20:43 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. In general the Wiki Community has decided that removing other peoples comments like http://daviswiki.org/Quiznos?actiondiff&version262&version161 you did goes against the agreed upon goals of the wiki. It is usually better to respond to a comment than to delete it. Ask if you have questions about how to deal with a comment like that, there are several techniques depending on how you take issue with it. Users/JasonAller
