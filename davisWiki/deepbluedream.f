Go to the top of the DQU page and click on the edit button. Dont delete what others have written, but rather, add your perspective to that of others. Were just volunteers here and I doubt very many know about DQU beyond what is printed in the newspaper. Users/WilliamLewis

Yes, please help out!  Best, Users/PhilipNeustrom

20090219 17:17:15 nbsp Well, I was thinking more along the lines of editing the main page instead of just leaving a comment. I can try to work your comment into the main page, but I really dont feel qualified. Users/WilliamLewis
