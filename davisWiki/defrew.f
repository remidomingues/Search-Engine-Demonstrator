You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you (or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here)... and sorry if your name is De Frew or something like that... it isnt quite obvious if its real or made up.  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for the link on Uni Cafe, and once again, welcome to the wiki! Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20081029 16:45:48 nbsp In response to your question on the Crepe House Uni page, youll note I had said, even though women would happily and freely choose to wear sexy clothes in the workplace, that they were deceiving themselves if they thought they were being perceived as serious professionals. Add to this the view of women as servants, and it does not project a positive picture of women.

You may not agree with my explanation.  But that is my explanation. Users/CovertProfessor
