Welcome to the Wiki!  Please take a moment to read over the Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner business owner/affiliate welcome page.  I see what looks like a common mistake in your http://daviswiki.org/SPCA_Thrift_Store?actiondiff&version21235&version11231 edits to the SPCA Thrift Store page.  The page is about the SPCA Thrift store.  Like all of the other pages on the wiki, its owned, operated, and maintained by the community as a whole.  As an affiliate of the store, you bring an insiders perspective to the page, and of course that perspective is very valuable!  But the person who made the edit you removed, commenting on hiring policy there, has exactly the same right to change content on the page as you and I and anyone else.  Wes (the person who made the edit you removed) was probably speaking from personal experience there, even if he was misinformed or misunderstood the hiring policy.  As noted on the business owner welcome page, above, the best way to deal with comments like that is often to respond to them and clarify, rather than to remove them.  Its entirely possible other people are operating under the same misunderstanding. Users/TomGarberson

20110120 17:20:21 nbsp I, as a random editor on Davis Wiki, have as much right to edit the SPCA Thrift Store page as you do. I have undone the edits you made to that page recently because you did not respect the edits made by previous editors there. If something is wrong, explain why it is wrong rather than deleting it. Deleting statements about SPCAs employment policies by just saying theyre wrong and not presenting the facts that say otherwise looks really shady... almost like the stuff you deleted is true and youre trying to hide it.

20110120 18:39:47 nbsp As a member of the community I feel the section about employment contains unprovoked malice and should be edited with facts, personal grudges aside. Save your bitterness for the comment section. Users/OliverEddy

20110120 18:49:53 nbsp Dennisyour comments on hiring are malicious and dont belong in the body of the SPCA page. Users/PeterBoulay

20110120 18:58:56 nbsp It was not my comment. Users/dennis.brovald

20110120 19:13:35 nbsp Peter was somewhat confused.  You might do well to read through Tom and Williams comments and the link Tom provided.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
