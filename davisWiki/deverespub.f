Describe Users/deverespub here.

20111118 13:04:55 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki!  Ive only been in once so far, but I absolutely love the pub!  Please take a minute to read over the Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner business owner/representative intro  theres some key stuff in there.  Youll find that the wiki works a bit differently from business listing sites and that kind of thing.  A couple of key distinctions are that business pages are written in the third person, and advertisingas opposed to adding information in a nonpromotional wayis prohibited by the wikis nonprofit agreement with the IRS.  The nice thing is, as a communityowned, built, and maintained resource, there are a lot of people around wholl pitch in and help out with a page.  If you have any questions, just ask!

One other thing to note: your user name, deverespub, is whats known as an organizational account.  Organizational accounts are frowned on here, and eventually get disabled.  This isnt because your contributions arent appreciated!   On the contrary, youve got a lot of information thats particularly valuable for the de veres page.  Its just that when it comes from an organizational user name, it kind of undermines the goal of promoting community.  The organizational account basically speaks from authority, setting itself apart from other users.  So, if you wouldnt mind, please use a different account to edit  its as easy to make a new one as it was to make this one, and again, if you have any questions, ask away. Users/TomGarberson
   Oh!  But before you disable the current account, change the email address so you can use it again to create the new account.  Go to settings in the upper right hand corner, remove your email address, save it, and then you can disable this account and create a new one.  No worries about mistaking the site for a business listing site  youre not the first.  A hearty and genuine welcome to the wiki to you, whoever you are!
