Howdy.  Is the name of Davis Israeli Dancing the group Davis Israeli Dancing (the title of the entry), Israeli Dance Club (the extra titled added inside the entry), or Davis Israeli Dance (the name used in the entry itself)?  It would probably be good to use the same one throughout the entry and drop the redundant second title.  The group sounds neat, though... what kind of dances do you guys do?
