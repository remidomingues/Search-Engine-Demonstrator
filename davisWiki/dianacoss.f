Hi Diana, is the University Farm Circle no longer doing the Moms Groups walks? I reverted the change because the page used to have several tidbits of information and links to it, but I see you removed mention of it at the UFC page too.  users/edwins ES

20100218 22:44:38 nbsp Hi, Yes, could you please delete this UFC moms group, it no longer exists, I tried to do it months ago, and someone brought to my attention that it was still up, unfortunately, she waited at Borders to go on the walk, so I dont want that to happen to anyone else.
