Describe Users/dickjones here.


20070719 18:50:09 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. Take a moment to go back and look at your http://daviswiki.org/Users/dickjones?actionuserinfo contributions. After reading through some you might want to look at Reviews. Users/JasonAller

20070719 23:47:09 nbsp I would concur, welcome to the wiki!   Users/StevenDaubert

20070723 22:00:36 nbsp How does http://daviswiki.org/Soga%27s?actiondiff&version298&version197 this edit help the wiki? Users/JasonAller

20070726 05:32:26 nbsp Or http://daviswiki.org/Starbucks?actiondiff&version285&version184 this edit, for that matter... Users/MichaelCheng

20070730 17:23:49 nbsp Ok, http://daviswiki.org/Osteria_Fasulo?actiondiff&version265&version164 here is another one.  These sort of comments add nothing useful to the wiki. Users/CharlesMcLaughlin

20070802 12:24:16 nbsp pls ban this vandal/troll. kthxbye. Users/WilliamLewis

20070802 13:10:29 nbsp I think what people are getting at is that many of your comments have extremely poor grammar, which makes them hard to understand, and often they are so general that they just state your opinion (sometimes insultingly) without telling the reader why you have the opinion that you do.  It would be helpful if you went back and edited some of your comments so that they were clearer and mentioned some specifics about what you liked and didnt like.   Users/CovertProfessor

20070803 18:38:49 nbsp This user also did a http://daviswiki.org/Osteria_Fasulo?actiondiff&version272&version171 malicious deletion of the Osteria Fasulo page after getting into a comment war with the owner. Users/ScottLay

20070804 05:53:29 nbsp Seems like the same guy as Users/Brians (or, at least, the same caliber..)  Wipe out all the comments both of them have made?  Seems like pretty obvious trolling to me.  Though, youve got to laugh at some http://daviswiki.org/Sudwerk?actiondiff&version2135&version1134 gems like this one.  Users/PhilipNeustrom
  Both are very similar, but at least Brianss comments have some small amount of content in it (he actually talks about items he liked at restaurants, etc.). I would not cry if dickjoness comments mysteriously vanished (unless I hurt my jaw from cackling), but if Brians is a sock, then it may be an attempt being slightly more than caveman. Users/KevinChin
  I was thinking the same thing.  At first I gave dickjones the benefit of the doubt, but weve seen a clear pattern of useless comments.  brians first edit was yesterday, so perhaps dickjones saw this page and created a new account thinking he could pull one over on us.  FWIW, I support clearing both of their comments.  Users/CharlesMcLaughlin
  All of his comments are poorly written, but it seems to me that most of them have some content in them, or at least as much content as other comments on the page.  I dont see the justification for deleting his comments or banning him.  Im not defending him, but rather Im worried that if we delete his stuff (and I agree that brians is sneakily similar) then we would be obligated to delete a lot of others. Users/CovertProfessor
    I agree with the CP.  It doesnt make sense to ban him.  Users/Graham.Freeman Graham
    While I agree that banning doesnt help (rather just forces one to create other accounts), Id still like to hear why he deleted the Osterio Fasulo page.  Users/ScottLay

20070820 01:33:23 nbsp Where are you loss prevention at? Users/StevenDaubert

20071115 22:18:49 nbsp about the loss prevention team that dickjones spoke of, I must agreethey really do keep a close eye on you.  Ive only shop there a few times and all those times that I have, I have to admit that I couldnt help but feel like I was being watched and followed like a dog.  It was so obvious that I felt very uncomfortable and out of place, which made me decide to take my business elsewhere to other grocery stores who are more subtle about it.  Has anyone felt the same way?  Is it b/c Im dark complexion?      Users/kikao

20100206 17:15:18 nbsp Some of your trolling has humor in them. Users/WengFF
