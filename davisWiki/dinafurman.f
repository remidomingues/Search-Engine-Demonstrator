20110304 09:06:27 nbsp Ive noticed that youve made several edits (http://daviswiki.org/Lily%27s?actiondiff&version220&version119 1 http://daviswiki.org/Lily%27s?actiondiff&version224&version123 2 http://daviswiki.org/Lily%27s?actiondiff&version226&version125 3) where you have removed the fact that Lilys occupies the space formerly used by Pinkadot 2. Looking at the picture, it looks like the old storefront to me. Also, the Lilys page states that the store is located at 218 E Street. Pinkadot 2 states the store was located at 218 E Street. Is any of this untrue? If not, what excuse do you have for removing this information? Users/WilliamLewis
