This is a discussion that started on EZ Smog/talk but really isnt about the issue there. It is being moved here to avoid sidetracking that discussion.

20130716 19:05:19 nbsp Not sure why we need something more neutral, since this is a MPOV wiki.  MW was expressing her viewpoint. Users/CovertProfessor

  Semantics Users/Aaron.Curtin
   Its not mere semantics.  The wiki does not strive for neutral, opinionless pages.  No one has given a reason why MWs comment shouldnt stand.  If it had in fact been made by a competitor, that would be a reason.  But as PB pointed out, MW is a grad student at UCD, not a fellow smog station owner.   Users/CovertProfessor

   I never said it shouldnt stand.  I think it should stand.  My original comment was directed at PeteB and his choice of words in trying to justify based on popularity. Not sure why you 2 are riding me on this.  Maybe Im not popular enough so my opinion doesnt hold as much weight as yours. See how stupid that sounds when you use popularity to quantify the statement. Users/Aaron.Curtin
   Then your issue is with me not the concern being discussed on this page. If you have an issue with me, please take it to users/peteB my page and you can continue your concerns there. Leave this page for the discussion at hand. Users/PeteB
     Users/Aaron.Curtin, Im not riding on you on this.  You were the one who responded to my comment, which had nothing to do with your conversation with PB, with the word semantics.  If you did not in fact intend to respond to my point about this being an MPOV wiki, please feel free to delete this little subconversation.  cp
