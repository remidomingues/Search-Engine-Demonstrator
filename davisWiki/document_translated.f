This is a work cited to contain evidence that Katehi worked to militarize the universities in Greece.  She was at UCD at the time, and was part of a committee that published this paper.  Im not seeing it, but I may have missed something very critical, as Ive only had time to skim it.  As this is a coauthored work with many authors, translated from Greek to English by an online translator, I would highly caution against reading in between the lines, or seeing things in the specific wording.  Given the uncertainty of automatic translation and lack of knowledge of her contributions to this work, certainly nothing here  assuming decent ethics  should be attributed as a quote of hers. (At least not without somebody who reads Greek double checking the original, and acknowledging it was from a paper with nine authors).


Omitted: From front: title page, contents.

  I did a once through and dont really see much regarding militarization.  The discussion under Strenthening Academic Administration:  The Academic Senate did seem to suggest some changes to the way the university system was managed, but it wasnt really any militaristic recommendation, more like the president should oversee the vice president should oversee the dean, etc.  Other parts of the doc seemed fairly progressive (recognizing that students only have a 40% vote share in the administration (findings), promotion of ethics and trust (recommendation f)).  Dunno, I could be missing something too.  Id be interested to see what others are finding. users/jefftolentino
   Just went back and read the original exiled writeup, and I dont see anything specific in the Katehi et al report that discusses the asylum law.  Maybe there is some other mechanism that Im missing, but the exiled article doesnt provide much in terms of the details.  Does anybody have more info on the asylum law that the exiled article is citing?   JT
   Maybe its partially the bad translation and lack of understanding of the full context, but the document mainly just seems annoyingly vague. The following struck me as weird, but I dont know what exactly the authors are implying. Are they saying student political power is a good thing or bad thing?

A series of political decisions led to policy administration within the university created an imbalance of power and control over academic matters and decisions. For example, students have 40% of the votes in the choice of university administrations. This imbalance has resulted in management decision making by political motives, which are not beneficial to the academic process.
...
The campus is safe. While the Constitution allows the university leadership to protect the campus from information seeking political instability, the deans have been reticent to exercise their rights and fulfill their responsibilities and make the decisions needed to ensure the safety of teachers and general staff and students. As a result, the university administration and faculty have shown good editors facilities entrusted to them by society.
...
The politicization of the universities  particularly the politicization of students  represents a logical addition to participation in the political process. This contributes to the rapid deterioration of higher education.

    I took the grammatical stuff as translational errors.  I wish I read Greek!  Id like to verify in better detail!  I also found a few vague parts, but assumed that the document was intended for high level policy direction rather than specific rulings.  If this were the case, the generalizations seemed ok to me.  Again, wish I knew Greek!  Its too bad the exiled article is not specific about how the document altered the asylum law.  That would help clear things up more. JT
  http://crookedtimber.org/2011/11/22/athenspolytechniccomestoucdavis/ This article quotes the part of the document that is apparently the militarization basis. The article cites both the original and a translated version and the passage in the translated version is not the same as the one below. I putI the original Greek copy into google translator and got the same version as provided below. Still doesnt clear it up but narrows the search a bit.  JT
     I think http://www.wsws.org/articles/2011/nov2011/green24.shtml this article provides interesting balance to Katehis justifications for why she claims she supported abolishing the asylum law. I think nearly everything she says has been BS. For example, if we now reconsider the context of the 40% remark in her collaborative paper, it seems as though Katehi thought the imbalance was due to students having too much power. She seems to fear student political movements. Not to say that she doesnt have any good reasons, but shes not being at all upfront with us about it. SM

Have you guys listened to Katehis http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/18690207#utm_campaignsynclickback&sourcehttp://chancellor.ucdavis.edu/initiatives/campus_protests/&medium18690207 comments about this document?  The questions that lead to her answer start around 17 minutes.   Users/CovertProfessor

So it appears that the google translation is in accurate, and the version quoted in the Crooked Timber article is more correct.  Katehi acknowledges changes to the asylum law (reallowing police onto campuses) both in the the town hall meeting CP cited, and this Davis Enterprise http://www.davisenterprise.com/localnews/crimefirecourts/katehidefendsroleinpolicereturntogreekcampuses/ article.  She was still one of a group of authors and defends reasonably in both at the town hall meeting and in the enterprise article.  However if were still interested in integrating this into the main page, the google translation is not the best choice.  JT



A. PREAMBLE

Greece is experiencing a time of critical change that will determine its future for decades to come. Therefore, higher education in Greece requires the adoption of a new model based on social values ​​and principles that characterize the culture of the country, which includes the Greek spirit of democracy and social justice.

Higher education in Greece revolves around the public university, which gave specific direction to the countrys development since the establishment of the Greek state and around the public technical institute, which had an important role in the development of the Greek economy after the Second World War. Despite the important role of the Greek university in the early years of postindustrial revolution, higher education in Greece during the 80s and 90s took a direction not aligned with the social and economic changes in Europe and elsewhere in the world. Since Greece joined the European Union, these differences became more pronounced and have created serious barriers to economic development and stabilization of social and political structures of the country.

Today, the organization and administration of the Greek university appears to be consistent with the needs of Greek society and the principles and values ​​that underpinned the creation of the Greek university system. Moreover, these administrative and economic barriers have created a culture of conservatism that prevents universities and scientific staff to achieve quality education and an adequate impact on society of their duties are obliged to provide. To enable the Greek higher education to strengthen and help it achieve its mission to improve the quality of life of all, you need to remove barriers and reshaped the Greek university.

The stakes are high, not only for the government and the academic community, but also for the entire country  cultural, social and economic level. Therefore, everyone must respond to this challenge. The proposals from Ministry of Education establish a new identity for the Greek higher education, and this report will comment on these proposals, offering independent observations and general recommendations.

The International Advisory Committee composed of nine members, is listed in Appendix A. Because of scheduling conflicts, only five members of the committee, President Katehi, President Sexton, President Naylor, Professor Hernes, and President Ritzen, were able to meet in Greece on December 17, 2010. This report was prepared by the five members of this committee who were able to meet at that time. It is based on documents that were made available before the meeting and notes from individual discussions with people who provided them. All nine members of the committee had access to this report and were able to add their own written comments.


B. REPORT
I. Introduction

In September 2010, the Greek government announced the establishment of an International Advisory Committee to evaluate the organization of Greek universities. The commissions mission is to provide general recommendations and advice on reform of the Greek university system so that it will achieve its mission to educate and help improve the quality of life and to bring this mission to that of European universities.

The committee consists of nine members from around the world have agreed to offer their experience and advice. The committee members are international scientists with extensive experience as presidents of major universities in the EU, U.S., Australia and Asia. This experience enables them to understand the challenges facing the Greek university and the Greek society and to evaluate the opportunities for reform and revitalization of higher education in Greece. The list of Committee members and brief biographies are attached in Appendix A.

A subcommittee consisting of the Rector Ms. Katehi, President Mr. Sexton, the President, Mr. Naylor, President Mr. Hernes and President Ritzen, visited Greece on December 17, 2010, and participated in discussions with the Minister u. Diamantopoulou Panaretos Deputy Minister, the Vice Rectors and various Greek universities as well as representatives of political parties.

Committee members who participated in this visit prepared this report reflects the impressions and observations and offer recommendations which the Greek government may take into account in its efforts to redefine and reshape higher education in Greece.

The Committee wishes to express his admiration for the will of the Greek government to undertake a thorough study of the state university system in the country. The target for reform involves changes to be implemented if we are to strengthen the Greek universities to improve the quality of education and become engines of innovation and economic growth.

History has shown that major economic crises affecting social values ​​and can lead to great social changes. The last two years, Greece is the center of an unprecedented economic challenges that threaten social values, doctrines and structures erected on which the Greek state.

To drive Greece out of the crisis to a future economic prosperity, the university system should be treated as the national capital. Should be preserved, strengthened and protected. As elements of national wealth, the Greek state to rely on the universities in administrative leadership and the research faculty as custodians and managers of the national wealth. Their primary role is to offer training as designated by the Greek Constitution, to ensure equitable access and learning and prepare students for employment and participation in civil society.

There is a large body of literature by educators and economists from around the world who have spoken about the importance of the university in support of democratic social structures and their contribution to strong economies. In the following paragraphs, we present some points that the observations and recommendations of this report.

 a. It is widely argued that the mission of public universities to provide access to excellence cannot be achieved without:
   sufficient resources
   autonomy and accountability
   responsible and enlightened university leadership
 b. Universities can become a driving force behind the economy if they produce a sufficient number of trained graduates. Without them, countries or states can not develop an innovative local ecosystem and support a thriving economy.
 c. Universities should teach progressive thinking and encourage entrepreneurship. Both theoretical and empirical data demonstrate that graduates with a broad education and learning skills that stem from curiosity is more likely to innovate and start their own enterprises.
 d.The ideal of full public financing of higher education and an intake system with no restrictions applied widely in Europe after World War II. But as the number of students grew, it needed more and more involvement by the state at time state financial obligations increased and people were becoming less willing or had less and less interest to pay higher taxes. The conflict between these two trends has limited the funding of universities and has negatively affected quality.

This report includes a set of observations and recommendations of a general nature that may be useful in helping the Greek government to reform the higher education system and improve the internal structures of Greek universities. The report is not intended to provide specific solutions but offers a range of possibilities. These recommendations aim to strengthen the Greek Universities and support their efforts to provide education to Greek citizens, to protect democracy and to promote upward social mobility.

II Comments
A. The Challenge

The major challenge for education policy in Greece is that the country is not making sufficient skills of its citizens. The results obtained are not in line with the skills available and can be developed. This applies not only to promote the achievements of those who continue in higher education, but better exploit the potential of every citizen.

Without changes, the education of the Greek population has deficiencies and research are not adequately staffed to meet the needs of a society based on knowledge. The sociopolitical consciousness and culture will be affected negatively. The Greek universities can not follow international standards. This is a problem that permeates the entire system, from basic levels of education by the time devoted to basic research.

But there is a serious basis for optimism: the Greek system of higher education may well be improved. With efforts motivated by enthusiasm and changes can be achieved overall improvement in both the quality and efficiency. What is desired is possible. The improvement in quality may be consistent with the goal of equal opportunity regardless of gender, social, geographic and ethnic or social origin.

The Greek system of higher education is entrenched in the pastwith structures and processes that prevent the development of skills and talents. No one today, if starting from scratch, not organizing higher education in Greece as it works this time. So it is urgently necessary radical reforms. There is a general feeling in Greece for what should be done. But the system provides shortterm benefits to those who seek to maintain the status quo, and therefore many find incentives to oppose the reform. Instead, it should give universities the freedom to make changes and the faculty, students and staff should be strengthened in this direction.

The challenges facing the Greek higher education can not be addressed piecemeal. It needed a fundamental reorientation in a well structured vision for the future of universities, based on international principles and practices to the goals of higher education and research. The Greek universities must change in an international environment and so constantly changing rapidly and irreversibly. Among the changes underway include the development of knowledge economy, the information revolution, the globalization of economies, migration and the outflow drain. If reforms are not implemented now to address these changes, Greece has a growing disadvantage.

No country in the western world is not so brilliant academic past, such as Greece, even the very heritage of ancient Greece has been the foundation for higher education and research worldwide. Greece needs to close the distance from the past, urgently and decisively.
A country as small as Greece can not continue to lose the talents of its citizens to leave to go to waste the abilities (talents) to its citizens. Should be taken a comprehensive reform program and implemented without delay.

B. The Findings
Apart from the various meetings in Greece on December 17, 2010, committee members had access to reports, documents and passages of the Greek Constitution relating to higher education. The reports, discussions and deliberations of the committee members reached the following conclusions:
This is a critical moment in Greek history, characterized by an economic crisis with serious implications for existing social and political structures of the country. Addressing this challenge, as identified above, requires a fundamental and substantial reform not only of the Greek financial structures, and educational institutions.

The Greek higher education system suffers from a crisis of values, and outdated policies and organizational structures. The tragedy is that leaders, scientists, students and political parties aimed at promoting the common good are trapped in a system that undermines their own aims, corrupting the ideals that seek out and leave the people they serve.

The size of the challenge and the urgency of the need to be addressed, not only requires reform, but also a change in the sociopolitical culture. And that can only come from radical changes, especially in institutions of higher education, which should lead by example and show standards for the rest of society.

The Committees deliberations showed that a clear majority of stakeholders support the reform of higher education, although there is agreement on what should this reform, who and how to start and that there is a strong minority that opposes the change.

A series of political decisions led to policy administration within the university created an imbalance of power and control over academic matters and decisions. For example, students have 40% of the votes in the choice of university administrations. This imbalance has resulted in management decision making by political motives, which are not beneficial to the academic process.

Among all EU Member States and some other countries (Australia, Israel, Japan, Korea, Mexico), Greece has the highest expenditure per student and the largest increase in expenditure between 1995 and 2005. However, the Greek universities and teachers feel the economic squeeze. They have no financial autonomy or accountability, and at the mercy of a bureaucracy that hinders any attempt to provide efficiency and transparency.

The Greek universities lack basic information technology and other assessment tools to measure parameters of input  output and objective performance assessment (Completion rates, job offers / salary, published work, and teaching effectiveness of teachers). For example, universities have establish mechanisms for monitoring vital statistics: how many students attend classes, how many how many graduating students is recorded at 5, 6 or 8 years, what is the cost of education for students, etc.

Using inadequate methods, the Greek state universities the lowest graduation rate in the European Union. Only about one third of registered
students graduating within the required time. For example, the 600,000 students who are believed to be enrolled in Greek higher education institutions, only about 180,000 have registered to receive our free guides provided by the state.

Of all EU countries, Greece has the largest number of students who left Greece to enroll in universities in Europe and other countries. Each year, 60,000 Greek students studying in European universities.

The unemployment rates of graduates, and periods of unemployment after graduation, is unacceptably high. The prospects for finding work undermined by the economic situation and reduced ability to compete with graduates from other European universities.

The campus is safe. While the Constitution allows the university leadership to protect the campus from information seeking political instability, the deans have been reticent to exercise their rights and fulfill their responsibilities and make the decisions needed to ensure the safety of teachers and general staff and students. As a result, the university administration and faculty have shown good editors facilities entrusted to them by society.

The politicization of the universities  particularly the politicization of students  represents a logical addition to participation in the political process. This contributes to the rapid deterioration of higher education.

• There are many pockets of remarkable research activity, but overall the research effort falls short in comparison with other EU members.

III General Recommendations
Over the last 30 years, the Greek university system has undergone organizational and cultural changes that prevent universities to achieve their goals and fulfill their mission.

Greece is trying to reverse this course and this process should also reform the economic and educational institutions that underpin society and their impact on economic growth. Education in general and higher education in particular, desperately need reform, if Greece is to maintain financial and economic initiatives that have been undertaken, and to reverse the terms of a declining economy.

Considering the above, the Committee proposes the following:

 A. Clarification of the Mission of the various institutions of the Greek higher Education: The University System

The Greek universities have unclear missions, inadequate objectives and uncertain future. There is a vague distinction between the fouryear technical education institutions and research universities. It is important that the Ministry of Education to begin a process that will help review and clarify the mission of all Greek universities. The Department should redefine strategic objectives and establish a system of Higher Education to programmatic agreements between those institutions that promote cooperation and coordination rather than encouraging competition and friction.

The Greek System of Higher Education lacks a very important component of postsecondary education: the two regional colleges.

These institutions play a key guidance role in educating society and economic development. The usefulness and importance of these colleges is their ability to:
  Provide a sound basis to students who wish to gain technical expertise and work in occupations that require highlevel education.
  Provide education to students who, at present, through the national evaluation tests (Panhellenic Examinations) have access to a Greek public institution of postsecondary education.
  Allow students to receive a solid education without having to leave their family homes and move to other communities, miles away from their city and their families.
  Allow better students to switch to fouryear colleges attended, with clearly defined conditions and procedures.

  Become a driving force for economic development for surrounding towns and communities

B. Strengthening the autonomy of the Greek Universities: The Board of Management

Universities should establish links with the international academic community to ensure a robust exchange of ideas, develop and maintain standards and to be associated with Greek scientists abroad.

Universities should be autonomous in the management of their resources, the choice of leadership and their management and decision making scholars who promote their strategic objectives. Each institution must be able to manage and support options and identify additional resources that will assist the institution in achieving its objectives.

The universities should be run and controlled by an appointed independent body which is responsible for the welfare of the university (or universities) to oversee. There are many examples across the world, but the two most common approaches are: (a) an independent board of any institution or (b) an independent board of a group of institutions that have common characteristics.
In an effort to strengthen the independence of universities, rectors, vicechancellors, presidents and other administrative departments responsible credits must be selected by special committees to find representation from alumni, faculty, students, members of nonacademic staff and externally appointed members, who enjoy great respect for the professional or social contribution and integrity. These committees should be associated with the administration board of the university. The leadership of universities should be appointed to a particular process and evaluated at regular intervals. The reappointments should be based on extensive internal and independent external review.


C. Strengthening Academic Administration: The Academic Senate

To achieve both an effective and successful government and a continuous improvement of academic quality, each institution should have a strong academic administration. Towards this direction, proposing a new system which will include a Senate institution. If two or more universities are grouped into a single system based on the mission or any other characteristic, it should also consider a joint Senate single system composed of all the presidents and vice of the Senate of the universities participating in a single system, and other members of the teaching research staff elected specifically to participate in this Sygklito6.

The choices of trainers with the crises and promotions members of the teaching research staff should be the responsibility of the University Senate with the decisions (whether relating to appointments, or promotions) are examined and receive final approval from the President (Rector). In the case of options members of the teaching research staff, the proposal should be submitted by the Chairman of the Department to the Dean and then by the Dean to the Vice President for Academic Affairs (Vice) or President (Rector). A similar procedure should be followed for the promotion of teaching members of research staff.

The chairmen will be selected by the competent investigative committees should be appointed by the Deans with the approval of the Vice President for Academic Affairs (Vice) or the President (Rector). The Deans will be selected by competent investigative committees should be appointed by the President (Rector) with the approval of the Governing Council of the University.


D. Ensure Accountability: Evaluation of Performance

It is necessary for universities to be accountable for their actions. They should have the responsibility for measurement and disclosure of their academic performance.

Universities need to acquire technology and information management tools to develop policies and procedures that will allow them to count on an annual basis the parameters of their performance and evaluate the effectiveness of their operation.
Some examples: Inventory of teaching and scientific staff in permanent orbit as individuals and as a fulltime equivalent teacher, temporary assistants as individuals and as a fulltime equivalent teachers, the students enrolled per year of degree (4 years, 6 years and 8 years) , the cost of research, publications, citations, etc.

Universities should indicate the teaching load of teachers, with matching credits and to focus on improving graduation rates and student retention. Improving graduation rates should become a primary goal.

E. Improvement Programs Undergraduate Studies and Graduate Support Studies

The Senate of the University should be responsible for reviewing and approving the content of undergraduate and postgraduate curricula. The content of the curriculum should be flexible, of high academic quality, and should reflect the needs of the professional classes and the needs and aspirations of Greek society.


The Senate must also deal with the organization of curricula and the examination procedure. The study should be defined in the rules of each institution, within a broad framework set by the state.

So the matter of new programs and changes in matter existing curricula should require final approval from the Vice President (Vice) and President (Rector). The various courses should be certified periodically by an appropriate board certification.

We support the establishment of schools or Office of Graduate Studies at each institution. These schools or offices will be responsible for developing and proposing graduate and doctoral programs in the Senate. These departments or agencies will ensure that the requirements of programs to award postgraduate degrees.


F. Ethics and Transparency: Creating a trust

In this particularly difficult period, every dollar spent on educating students is important. A special public service or an independent authority should be responsible for the management and allocation of public funding to institutions to assess the cost of services for the development of appropriate indicators and standards and to collect all necessary data from institutions .

It is necessary for universities to create a set of rules relating to and governing the conduct of science teachers, administrative staff and students on a wide set of moral principles. Universities should have clear terms that define and address conflicts of interests and conflicts of commitment to protection from involuntary cases of abuse, mismanagement, plagiarism and nepotism. Universities should have a clear set of rules and procedures to promote and safeguard academic ethics in a way that inspires confidence.

Each University must make its own audit of various financial functions and to regularly report the results of this audit.
