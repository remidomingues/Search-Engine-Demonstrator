Dodgeball is coming to Davis, or at least we think it should! If enough people are interested in playing well organize games around Davis. All levels are welcome. If youre interested in having fun and/or throwing balls at people (fun optional, throwing balls required) leave a comment here or on our facebook page (and like us while youre at it)! Spread the word!!
