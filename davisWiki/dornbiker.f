I tried to edit the Buzz page to some sort of compromise. I think the current version should satisfy both you and WL. I also think it doesnt have anything at all to do with bike church or other programs.  Some people are just fiercely protective of the wiki. Stick around, check the wiki out.  Chime in now and then on other pages. etc.  users/edwins ES

20090424 12:19:11 nbsp Hey, Dorn... is The Buzz open to the public, to university connected people, to students, or just to undergraduates?  Right now, it doesnt specify that it is limited in any way.  Who can attend? Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, (814) 8898845

20090424 12:21:19 nbsp Also, it might be a good idea to add contact information for bands or other entertainment looking to perform. Users/JabberWokky

20090731 10:03:10 nbsp You cant correct it, but it can be deleted.  Add it to the correct date, and let me know and Ill delete the incorrect one for you.  Yes, it stinks, and yes its one of those it would be really good if people could edit events, but nobodys stepped up yet to add the ability to edit them.  One of those were all volunteers things. Users/JabberWokky

20090731 10:22:35 nbsp Thanks JabberWokky. Users/dornbiker

20090731 11:06:51 nbsp Hey, to be clear, which one is the WRONG date? Users/JabberWokky

20100719 16:17:56 nbsp Are you personally repudiating the http://daviswiki.org/Users/TheWarrior?actionuserinfo edits http://daviswiki.org/Users/CampusRec?actionuserinfo (2) of the students under your employ? Users/WilliamLewis

20100721 09:54:23 nbsp http://daviswiki.org/Campus_Recreation?actiondiff&version252&version151 You cant have it both ways. Either Users/CampusRec represents Campus Recreation or it doesnt. My question is, do you still maintain that the CampusRec account is a representative of campus recreation? If so, the information at the top of the page is relevant and it belongs (the account did edit My Broskies, one or more users of the account did Users/TheWarrior engage in inappropriate sockpuppetry and flaming). If not, it isnt authoritative and needs to go.

Oh, and stop trying to make this personal. I have no grudge against you or campus recreation, as you have stated in the past. Im just interested in the health of the wiki and am concerned about the edits made by an account you claimed was officially sanctioned last time we spoke. Users/WilliamLewis

20100721 15:32:29 nbsp When you are editing and see {{{Rec Hall}}} and replace it with Pavilion instead of {{{The Pavilion at ARC Pavilion}}} it removes a link from the page. Users/JasonAller
