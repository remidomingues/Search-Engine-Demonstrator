Describe Users/dpb here.
Welcome to the Wiki, dpb!  All of the pages on this Wiki are contributed by users just like you.  If you feel that something is inaccurate, you are more than welcome to fix it yourself.  In the event that your experience differs from others experiences, itd be perfect to note that experiences vary when it comes to noise.  The Comments bar is a handy tool, but it sometimes creates the (incorrect) perception that content above the bar is somehow different than that appearing below it.  Even if the initial page text was written by the apartments management, though, thats just not the case.  Wiki business pages are about the business, not for the business.  Meaning that the experiences and perspectives of you and I are every bit as important as those of management/owners. Users/TomGarberson
