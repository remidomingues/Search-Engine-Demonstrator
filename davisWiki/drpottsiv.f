20100621 14:09:43 nbsp alright, well, Im having a little trouble finding out how to make a separate page  I am also a little impatient, so maybe Ill take another look later.

But I want to start a page for the World Cup in Davis.  I know of only two places I can view the World Cup:  The Graduate and 3rd and U cafe.

I have heard rumors that I can watch the world cup at Tacos and Beer and El Mariachi Taqueria.  I have not yet confirmed these.

So what do you say (anyone who may be reading this)  should Davis Wiki have a World Cup page?  I say yes! Users/drpottsiv

20100702 16:32:46 nbsp Did you see World Cup? I was right there with you on needing better info about where to watch.

A lot of the listed places are pretty spotty, actually, and have few fans watching but Little Prague is not a bad choice. Usually not as many people as The Grad but depending on who youre cheering for, that can sometimes be a good thing :) Users/JoRo
