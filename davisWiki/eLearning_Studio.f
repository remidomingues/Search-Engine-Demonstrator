The eLearning Studio is a free to use multimedia space where faculty and graduate students can record themselves lecturing. The facilityâ€™s primary function is to enable content creation by faculty members with minimal supervision of ATS Staff. The studio includes a video camera that records directly to a Mac Pro, a lapel microphone, screen capture software, video editing software, a green screen, and a waccom tablet.

ATS Hopes to offer a http://acmsblog.wordpress.com/2014/04/29/thelearningglass/ Learning Glass system in the near future, which will make it much easy to record math and physics lessons.
