For example, Front Page/Talk is for discussing changes to Front Page. http://daviswiki.org/Front_Page/Talk?actiondiff&version2111&version1109 Your edits to that page are out of place and have been removed. If you want to start a discussion about proposition 8, there are Rainbow Community other  Marriage Equality California places on the wiki you might want to consider. That being said, the wiki really isnt the best place to start a discussion. Wikis are good at getting people together to create a collaborative collection of knowledge. They dont fare so well as a venue for discussion. Users/WilliamLewis

20080911 07:42:58 nbsp Hey, I noticed that you added your note to the Wiki Spot front page as well.  Wiki Spot hosts wikis from around the world; I doubt that the Wiki Spot editors in China or Russia (or even just Tennessee) are interested in the issue.  It may make more sense to just make a Proposition 8 entry on this wiki and document the details of the proposition and add both the pros and cons.  Keep in mind that, as William says, wikis are really good at building an informative entry about a topic and very very bad at back and forth discussion.  A list of points that other people can add to is much more viable than a signed treatise that doesnt encourage community editing. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
