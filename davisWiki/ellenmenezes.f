20100624 12:18:01 nbsp Hi Ellen, and welcome to the wiki!  I notice youve been posting acai tasting notices for each day throughout June on the Events Board.  Typically, that site is reserved for individual community events, as opposed to research projects and that sort of thing.  It comes across as borderline spam when its a daily thing on there.  Am I right in guessing that its part of a food science or other research project? Users/TomGarberson
