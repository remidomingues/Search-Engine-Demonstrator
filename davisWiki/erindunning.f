20110923 13:41:31 nbsp Hi, Erin, and welcome to the wiki!  Thanks for your updates to the Bikram Yoga Davis page.  You wondered who was in charge of the Davis wiki  the answer is, we all are!  That is, all of the members of the Davis community who care to participate.  So, yes, when you see something wrong, please update it.  You might also want to read the Welcome to the wiki/Business Owner page.  It tries to clarify the roles of business owners and and the community in editing pages about Davis businesses.  I hope you stick around to make other edits! Users/CovertProfessor
