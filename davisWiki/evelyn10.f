Welcome to the Wiki Howdy, Evelyn, and welcome to the wiki!   Thanks for pointing out that the rent information on Allegre Apartments is incorrect.  If you could correct it, it would be great  theres no special group of people who edit the wiki: every entry is edited by people like you who make a little change when they see something to add or fix.  When we all do that, it keeps the wiki correct and has built, slowly over time, what the entire wiki is today.  Welcome, thanks for the review, and I encourage you to fix those rent figures!
