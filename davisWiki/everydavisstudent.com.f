http://everydavisstudent.com everydavisstudent.com is a Christian website that appears to be advertising the 2007 I Found It I found it too campaign. (http://ifoundittoo.com/ ifoundittoo.com) It is run by the local Campus Crusade for Christ. Curiously, it does not state its affiliation anywhere except http://www.everydavisstudent.com/about.php one page.

Their website contains material from the CCCs Real Life newspaper. It argues for the existence of god (and against abiogenesis and evolution) and the divinity of Jesus.

The parent organization of everydavisstudent.com is http://everystudent.com everystudent.com, which is run by the national CCC organization.
