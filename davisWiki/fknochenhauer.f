My name is Fritz Knochenhauer.  I was raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, am #6 of 8 kids and live in Davis.  Im in my early 50s, am a passionate bicyclist and, for the most part, enjoy the quality of life in Davis.  As a neighborhood activist, I routinely FIGHT THE BLIGHT in my neighborhood, building awareness of important issues and try to improve bicycling corridors so our kids and families feel empowered to safely bicycle to school and around town.


Knochenhauer (pronounced noknhower) is an old professional trade name, like Smith, Miller or Baker and means butcher in northern Germany. At least 30 different German surnames can be put down to the butchers trade. This means many Knochenhauer emigrants were related by the union of butchery rather than bloodlines (pun totally intended).

In German, knochen means of bone and hauer (actually hauen) has various literal meanings from cutter to hacker, chopper, hitter, crusher or smasher.  In my family, we understood Knochenhauer meant bonecrusher or bonechopper. Contrary to popular myth, it does not mean surgeon, mortician, or bone carver.

Things I believe in:
 Equality
 Nonmotorized transportation
 Factual, accurate information
 People
 Friendships
 A higher power

BTW, I have been using the Internet since 1985, had a modem when people said, Whats that for? and first experienced the Web in 1993 by using a customized version of Mosaic later Netscape on a Silicon Graphics Onyx workstation I owned while connected to a 128k/bps ISDN line at home.  As a former technical and marketing director at an authorized distributor which sold System V Unix, SCO Xenix, Univel, Novell and other personal computer hardware and software, I was an early strategist, believer and investor in various online technologies, lived and worked in Silicon Valley and am connected with many of the early founders of the dot.com and online strategy eras.  I have no financial or political agenda in Davis other than a commonsense agenda for its citizenry so it can maintain its relatively nice qualityoflife.

20101217 11:37:29 nbsp Im curious if one (i.e. me) can delete posts made previously?  I know.   Its like revising history....but sometimes we get stupid and do as stupid does...not a worry, just a question. Users/fknochenhauer
    fknochenhauerYou cannot truly remove themthey are in the history but you can remove it via edit if you wishor if theres nothing posted after it, click on the Info tab and revert to the version just before yours. PeteB

20101217 12:08:02 nbsp Also, if its something dumb or dangerous, just ask and it can be scrubbed from the history.  Every so often somebody posts a social security number or somebody elses home address without asking first.  Everybody makes dumb mistakes now and then, so dont be too worried about it.  If its a clear mistake or slipup that might actually harm somebody (like an SSN or address), it can be removed from the history.  If its something you just wish you hadnt said, its more fair to just remove it and leave it in the history (everybody does that at times, too... so thats not too terrible either).

20110913 11:43:11 nbsp There is a phrase that is often spoken on the internet that is applicable to this situation: lurk moar

Why dont you go to People and look at some pages in /Users ? Theyre pages associated with actual user accounts on the wiki and they have to do with the persons activities on the wiki. Lets look at the account in question. http://daviswiki.org/Users/EveWestBessier?actionuserinfo. That user has never done anything, so there is nothing to speak about. Now I could get into some more detail about how the page you created is an ad that violates Wiki Community/For Profit Restrictions, but its unnecessary at this point. A userpage should not exist for a account that has never done anything. Users/WilliamLewis
  http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?termlurk%20moar Lurk moar as users/WilliamLewis calls me in this situation. is insulting, demeaning and contemptuous.  As a nationallyranked cyclist, swimming and AYSO youth soccer coach with loads of experience in assisting others, I fail to understand why anyone claiming to be helpful would use such a term.  I also have over 30 years of businesstobusiness marketing communications expertise.  I guess treat others as you would like to be treated comes to mind here, William Lewis.  And, whats wrong with that among editors?
 So, really, if oneupsmanship is the goal or its simply William who has an ego larger than life itself, theres no reason to expound on it to the newest members.  Im sure there will be a volley or some sort of return to this commentary from others, but i would challenge those to hit the pause button and decide if their angst and sense of retribution exceeds the norm and standards of the ethics of the greater Wiki.  Afterall, its just a Wiki...however, if youd like to get into a battle of wits, I refuse to do so with an unarmed person, William.  Your turn.  Fritz Knochenhauer
  I do not doubt you have had many varied experiences and accomplished many great things in your life. You still came into the wiki and posted a promotional puff piece and placed it on a userpage for a user with no activity, demonstrating an ignorance of the customs and social expectations of an online community. I apologize if you found the phrase I used to be insulting, demeaning, and contemptuous because that was not my intent. At no time did I treat you in a way I would not like to be treated myself. Seriously.
  Anyway, since youve stooped to insulting me both here and on my userpage, I doubt it would be worth anyones time to continue this discussion. But just to put a few things out there... Nothing here is about my ego or oneupmanship. This may be just a wiki to you, but to many of us who have put so many hours into making this wiki one of the best of the world, it is so much more. Its a work of which we are justifiably proud and we wish to see it do well. As such, it makes me quite happy to see you add good content like you have over at Cowboy Guy. As long as you continue to do stuff like that, Ive got no beef with you. Cheers. Users/WilliamLewis
   This guy has a Ban William Lewis page, so i doubt he gets what an unhappy personality he portrays.  If its not his way its the highway.  I seldom engage with such moronic misfits, because theyre not worth the mind space, but this stooge thinks hes some kind of wiki guru or brand up to whom others should look.  Id rather pee in my pants than let this guy have the last say.   Your turn, Willie 


20110913 12:06:25 nbsp Editing is fine. Deleting is not.

Thats pretty audacious. As I explained before, user pages are about the account they are associated with. The page you created is associated with an account that has never done anything on this wiki. Again, I http://daviswiki.org/Users/EveWestBessier?actionuserinfo link you to the blank edit history of the account. Therefore, there is no reason for it to exist and it should be deleted. Users/WilliamLewis

20110913 12:32:55 nbsp Dont jump to conclusions about why Eve has not made edits to her wiki.

Were talking about a gift of time made by me to Eve who has for years been frustrated by not being able to create, understand or manage her own wiki.  I knocked it out in less than a day cheerfully and without recompense.  My first wiki, ever.  This is why Ive done all those little edits while she has taken a week off from teaching students in Davis (her only vacation this year).  Last night, I sent the link to her wiki for her review.  A Comment box was included today in the page which should have been the first go to area for feedback.  Im NOT angry with you, but puzzled by your arbitrary decision to delete valuable information without prior communication.  Im a stakeholder since I spent time and energy on her behalf and expected something tangible on the Davis Wiki.  Instead, youve summarily deleted a creative project that was wellformatted.

Since many of the raw data files used for Eves page reside on my Mac, I must use my account and my Mac for creating Eves wiki.  There is no subterfuge here.  Im not profiting from this nor is Eve who simply doesnt have the time or energy to play in setting up her wiki.  Personally, I enjoyed the challenge.  Until now.

As a 25 + year resident of Davis, Eve West Bessier is considered a community asset, a public figure, a performing artist, an instructor to many youth and adults, as well as a wellregarded citizen.  There is no intent here to create an ad but rather portray her value to the community and her capabilities in serving it.  Perhaps the page was nicely developed, welllinked and looked different, but other musicians and music teachers also have personal wikis with such information.  Restoring Eves wiki seems sensible and providing the guidelines as you have done is helpful.  Thanks for being rational about this.  We look forward to seeing Eves wiki restored.

I encourage you to review Eves published works and longterm commitment to the Davis community:  http://www.evewestbessier.com/publishedworks.html.  Or Google her. Users/fknochenhauer


20110913 12:37:17 nbsp I have not jumped to any conclusions. I am not being arbitrary

Its simple. The account associated with the userpage youve created is not active on the wiki. Thus, under no circumstances is there ANY reason to have a userpage associated with that account. There is nothing to write about the activities of an account when that account has never done anything. Thus, the page should not exist. Period. There no debate over this. Users/WilliamLewis

20110913 12:43:38 nbsp Ive been deliberately staying away from this, but I do want to make one clarification: see Wiki Community/Glossary for the difference between a User Page and a Public Figure Page.  The problem William is raising is that the page was created as a user page for someone who (as far as I can tell) isnt a user.  Hence, its the wrong page.  Eve West Bessier would be the place to make a page about Ms. Bessier, rather than Users/EveWestBessier.

Ill also note that I find it to be pretty promotional.  It reads like a an advertisement.  The problem isnt the amount of information, its the tone. Users/TomGarberson

20110913 12:46:05 nbsp Actually, Im not connected with the Area Music Teachers at all  just someone who edits many pages on many topics.  One point of confusion here is that the sort of page you made isnt really what user pages  pages for people who edit the wiki  are for.  Rather, the content you created was more appropriate for a public page.  (See, e.g., Sue Greenwald).  So, that page would and should be named Eve West Bessier, not Users/EveWestBessier.  A small point, but sometimes small points can be important.  As for the content of the page, perhaps welcome to the wiki/business owner this page would be helpful in understanding why some people think the content that you wrote needs to be less adlike. Users/CovertProfessor

20110913 13:01:14 nbsp Great feedback!  When I created my fknochenhauer account over a year ago, I fished for guidelines about what was acceptable use.  It wasnt selfevident.

Last week, when I looked at other Davisarea musicians for comparison to what Eve desired in her wiki, I simply followed what I saw in their wikis;  various images, links, performance calendars.  Overly promotional?  I think not, but anything is changeable, modifiable when reasonable decisions area made.  Shes a performing artist with a visual and audio story to tell.  It takes more than words to bring dimension to her background and service to the Davis community.

Deleting (nuking) someones creative effort seems contrary and counterproductive.  Ill gladly  modify, within the context of existing guidelines, content considered too promotional.   Just because this is my first wiki, which may seem overly promotional to you, it doesnt deserve the death sentence, does it?  Im being professional about this and demonstrating what results from a nice days effort.  But, now theres nothing to show for it.  Doesnt seem fair to me....or Eve.  Lets let commonsense prevail on this and nudge this in the right direction.  Fritz Users/fknochenhauer

20110913 13:11:32 nbsp I agree that the content should not have been deleted entirely, just moved to a differently named page, as JabberWokky has now done.  As for it being promotional, I think its sentences like the following that sound promotional: uniquely qualified to be a life coach and creative consultant. Her approach is highly creative, compassionate and tailored to the unique needs of each client.  But that is something that can be fixed. (Did you read the link that I gave you?  Here it is again:  Welcome to the wiki/business owner).  Users/CovertProfessor

20110913 13:19:47 nbsp No worries.  There is some legitimate concern about the whole IRS and noncommercial restrictions, but any vocal coach or UCD researcher pretty much should have a wiki entry about them.  Im thinking the direct link to the testimonials should probably go, as that leans a wee bit into the commercial promotion, whereas the link to her website (which presumably has the testimonials listed anyway) is more documentary in nature. Users/JabberWokky

20110913 13:23:05 nbsp Incidentally, I think its just a matter of one person saying youre doing it wrong! and deleting it.  There was already a discussion underway about how to rewrite it to be a little less commercial in nature (to comply with that pesky IRS restriction), so I think a few people took it as a given that the entry should be put back up.  Im just the one who grasped the nettle and started working on it.  I also did some fancy wiki layout to try and make it look nice. Its aesthetics, so I cant promise you or Eve will like it better, but it generally matches the rest of the wiki now.  Those are some cool photos, by the way! Users/JabberWokky

20110913 14:05:33 nbsp Theres a discussion going on Eve West Bessier/Talk about touching up the contents of the page.  I went ahead and took a stab at integrating information from the personal statement into the main entry (most of it was duplicated in the entry already), and reworked a couple of the more promotional bits. Users/TomGarberson

20110913 15:08:57 nbsp Now, who would respond to my post on WilliamLewis page w/o attribution with the Bullshit... paragraph as below?  Is this for real?  Is this aimed at me?  Come on, now.  Im missing something here.  This is only a wiki.  Who posted this insane rant?

20110913 11:59:43   BTW, re: users/evewestbessier (http://www.evewestbessier.com), the wiki page that I created and you deleted was a gift from me to Eve, who has been frustrated for years that she couldnt seem to create, edit and manage a personal wiki page of her own. You have stolen her surprise gift while she has been on vacation this week. I did the edits with her knowledge that I was creating a page on her behalf. If there is some violation of terms, lets compare with other musicians pages on the Davis Wiki. Eves just looked better than most.

Youre welcome to provide constructive feedback, link suggestions/guidelines, but restoring the page in its entirety putting your comments in the Comment box seems appropriate and the way to go. Lets work together on this, o.k.? Editing is fine. Deleting is not. —fknochenhauer

20110913 18:18:37 nbsp Please allow me to say that before this deletion drama for Users/EveWestBessier occured I noticed that Eve wasnt being a user, so I thought to rename the page to a people page Eve West Bessier.  That thought didnt occur to me until I was away from the computer, which is why I didnt rename the page right away, in case anyone was wondring.  Its similar to situations that have existed before where a user page gets renamed something other than a user page, for example, International Festival.  Besides the issue of whether a user is editing or not, to me what was being created on Eves user page looked like it belonged on what I call a people page;  not all editors may agree with this.  If Eve ever decides to do some editing she may recreate her user page.  Whatever happened to her previous editing attempts that you mentioned? Users/BruceHansen

20110913 18:30:59 nbsp Thanks, Bruce, Don, David, Evan, et al.  Eves page is now nice and tight, wellformatted and represents her value to the City of Davis and Sacramento Communities.  I did move the main graphic of her to the left so it faces toward the main body of text instead of her face and view running off the right side of the page.  Aesthetics, lookandfeel, etc.  Others (Dr. Andy Jones) have similar formatting.

Appreciate hanging with me/us on this.  After all these years, I know Eve and her community will greatly appreciate her wiki.  Keep it simple.  Peace & Joy.  Thanks once more. Users/fknochenhauer
   Peace & Joy???  Wow, now I know youre a socialist!  ;)  Users/WesP Wes
   No worries  as I said, I formatted it to a fairly common wiki layout, which doesnt mean the one true way.  Aesthetics are always bouncing around a bit because everybody has different opinions.  I personally like a bit of variety (take a look at Sunflowers), so Im happy to see a bit of a twist.  Im glad you hung with everybody, realizing that its a full pack of people, so you have all kinds of folks with different social attitudes.  Just like Davis.  Peace and Joy back at ya! Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20110913 22:58:25 nbsp There is no approval process here  its just the consensus of who is editing, and that consensus can change.  That being said, I too am a little curious about why hankim is editing the way he is.  My guess is that he is reacting to your being resistant to many of the links people have added, and so he is reacting by adding lots of them.  As JabberWokky said, lots of personalities here.  What might help is going away from the page for a little while.  Sometimes things can get hot and a cool off is helpful. Users/CovertProfessor

20110913 22:59:34 nbsp The reason why youre getting some resistance is you are removing perfectly good links and generally fiddling with the page to make it worse. Relax and take it easy. Users/WilliamLewis

20110913 23:20:54 nbsp Im done here.  Linking Eves SFSU English degree internally to a UC Davis English Dept. wiki page is incorrect/misleading.  So, I removed it until I could find a SFSU English Dept. link, but hankim reverted the page.  Eve also feels a sentence about living with her cat makes her vulnerable and indicates she lives alone.  This is a valid PERSONAL SAFETY concern so I removed this verbiage   Why is this hard to figure out?  Gnite, good luck and I really do hope people Chill Out on the unnecessary editing and linking.   Users/fknochenhauer

20110913 23:24:33 nbsp Wow.  This comment turned into a treatise.  Sorry.

Hey Fritz, have you read the Welcome to the Wiki page and/or the Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner?  One or both might clarify some things.

First, theres no approved version of the page.  People have many different opinions on page content.  Everyone edits to try to come up with a good result.  Sometimes there are disagreements over whats the right result.  The way to handle that is to explain why your version is preferable to the alternative, rather than to appeal to authority.

Second, interconnectivity is a big part of the wiki.  While its possible to go overboard, as a general rule the idea is that more linkage is good.  Links coming in, links going out.  Linking English on the page isnt saying that she went to the SFSU English program.  Its saying she studied Englishand, hey, look, heres info on English on the Davis Wiki!  Its not misleading.  Its connecting ideas within the Davis context.  If someone were looking for the SFSU English program theyd have to resort to Google, but theres nothing wrong with that.

People are also leery about deleting links, because the level of interconnectivity on the wiki is just so cool.  I can go from Eve West Bessier to reading about Cats in Davis to learning that Sir John Walter Chauntecleer Bangoo is the Korean word for fart.  From there I can head down the pilates road to the local Jazzercise program... which is horribly underlinked, and Im damn close to a dead end.  Thats a page that needs work.  And links.

So, collaborative editing and links are both good.

The third point is promotional language.  Part of the thing about the wiki is that its an informational resource for the community that tries to get the individual involved.  The general atmosphere here is one of inclusion.  Perspectives, opinions, jokes, etc.  While you may prefer, as a PR professional, to try to keep things clean and professional, thats not really a part of what happens on the wiki.  While a number of us try to keep things relatively civil and businessfriendly (not everyone, although thats a conversation for another time), sterility really isnt a part of it.  Quirkiness is a big part of what makes the wiki so great.  Paesanos isnt really a restaurant on a flatbed.  We all realize that.  Its a joke.

I guess the point there is to give your readers some credit.  The wiki is both a great font of information and a fun place to look around.  The people who use the wiki arent idiots (with a few Users/LoshJawson exceptions).  They can read.  They wont be deceived into thinking that someone who studied English at SFSU studied English at Davisbecause it says where she studied it.

Unfortunately, you kind of got the short end of the stick today.  A lot of the regulars around here have gotten kind of jaded.  There have been a number of particularly draining disputes on the wiki in the last few months, involving manipulation, abuse, legal threats, and so on.  Youve caught some of the fallout from that.  It used to be that most folks around here would give new users the benefit of the doubt.  Thered be some outreach, explaining wiki norms and giving the why underlying changes, reversions, etc.

Sadly, there have been some pretty abusive users recently who took advantage of the friendly atmosphere to try and get their way, get around legal restrictions or abuse wiki norms.  Some of the wiki regulars have gotten suspicious.  Among the other things that have come up in some of these disputes are appeals to authority (soandso said it was OK, so its done, stop changing the page!) and micromanagement of a page with an insistence on exercising exclusive control over its content.  Because both of those things were done so abusively recently, there can be a bit of a kneejerk reaction to them now.  As youve discovered, Im afraid.

Anyway, I hope youll continue to engage on the wiki and get a feel for the way things typically blunder along here.  Its a great resource and, most of the time, a fun one to work on.  I do recommend both trying to get a feel for the norms and relaxing a bit.  Taking it too seriously is generally a bad idea, both because many people will have different ideas and because there are those wholl mess with you if you take things too seriously.  It is The Interwebs, after all. Users/TomGarberson

20110920 22:17:38 nbsp Trees and a gorgeous blue sky are the things most often missed by metropolitan citizens.  Most dont even notice the lack of blue sky or nice, broad, shadegiving trees.  We have a wonderful opportunity to save a cityowned parking lot, turn it into something else and avoid a CONCRETE JUNGLE.  Why cant we have a small kiosk with a parking dude/dudette charging hourly parking rates at this cute lot?  Im not ingenious, but this makes so much sense if revenuegeneration is the goal.  If not, then have this parking lot THE PLACE for employees of businesses to park.  Give them some reason to park here instead of curbside, using spaces for valuable car drivers.  I understand that, at times, over 50% of surfacestreet parking spaces in the downtown area are used by employees.  Is this factual?  That seems like an easy deal to solve, doesnt it?  Keep the faith that, eventually, cardriven excursions will simply not be financially reasonable in favor of cargobikes and others pulling trailers, with racks, bags or other conveyances to haul purchases.  If I were a downtown businessperson, Id give a 5% discount to anyone who is a nonmotorized patron.  Dont ask me how, but Id do it.  If they have car keys inhand, they dont qualify.  Offer an incentive for nonmotorists, safe passage and favorable parking for bikes and youve got a winner.  Go to Amsterdam.  Youll get the idea very quickly. Users/fknochenhauer

20110922 21:57:23 nbsp As for the nonmotorized discount, I guess if I owned a shop downtown, Id give a 5% discount PLUS a buy 10 get 1 free deal to anyone who showed me a bike helmet, a stroller, scooter, Rollerblades, skateboard(?), parachute or other nonmotorized implement that had them arrive downtown without utilizing a parking space.  I also would give a free nonmotorized implement to my employees so they wouldnt drive to my work.  I dont see people in cars buying MORE than others, but I do see them causing more problems, costing hidden dollars and creating street redesigns where, if there were FEWER cars, it might be a safer and more pleasant downtown in which to shop.
