Describe Users/flamecrow here.

20100502 09:40:42 nbsp Hi flamecrow, and Welcome to the Wiki.  Please consider closing this account and making a new one under your RealName so you can establish an identity here.  While I can understand your frustration with the DPD interaction, its a lot more constructive to leave the ad hominem out.  Personally, I think theres enough genuine input there that it has a place, but I would encourage you to edit the comment (you can just double click on it) and refine it a little bit.  There are those who will probably object more strongly to the post and might simply delete it in its current form. Users/TomGarberson
