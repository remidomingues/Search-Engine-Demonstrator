#redirect Mass Posterings


## Mass Postering is accurate, but there is no way on Bobs brown earth that anybody is going to ever use the phrase in an entry.  Whereas everybody and their cybernetic uncle calls them fliers.  Hey, did you see the fliers for the party? Have you heard about this cool new band? I just saw one of their fliers!  And there are no weapons of mass postering in Iraq.

## Of course, people misspell it flyers all the time, but thats a different issue.
