Connecting the people, places and events that shape our communities. 
So much of the unique knowledge and experiences we acquire through years of living in a community gets spread only by word of mouth, or worse—just stays “locked up” in our heads. But this is great stuff, valuable expert knowledge that can benefit everyone! After all, when it comes to the communities where we live, we are all experts.

The LocalWiki project is an ambitious effort to create communityowned, living information repositories that will provide muchneeded context behind the people, places, and events that shape our communities. We have already proven it can work and provide tremendous benefits to a community. In 2004 we started the Davis Wiki, an experimental project to collect and share interesting information about the town of Davis, California, that soon became the worlds largest and most vibrant community wiki. Today, the residents of Davis use it for everything from learning about local news and local history to helping return lost pets to their owners.

With your help, we want to help as many communities as possible realize the full potential of such an amazing information resource. We have received a grant from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, as part of its Knight News Challenge, to develop the next generation of wiki software that is tailored to the needs of local communities. However, the software is only one major aspect of our project, which will require extensive community outreach, coordination, and education to ensure success. Thats where we need you!

Pledge today, choose a thankyou gift, and help us bring communityowned collaborative media to all of our communities. Your donation is taxdeductible and will be used to start more pilot communities and help them grow. Once several pilot communities become successful, they can start helping each other. Pledges can be made by visiting http://kck.st/a5vx43

Sign up at www.localwiki.org to get involved, receive updates on our progress, and suggest new pilot communities.

 Support the future of Davis Wiki 
Since 2004, Davis Wiki has brought us Davisites the little, enjoyable things about our community.  It puts information about community art and entertainment, city history, local politics, delicious food, and more at your fingertips.

The folks behind Davis Wiki are working on their most ambitious project: LocalWiki.  Just as they have provided a communityowned resource for Davis, they seek to expand other communities.  But as part of this project, Davis Wiki will receive many upgrades that will make it better than ever:
  WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get) editing to make it easier to contribute
  A new server for faster loading
  Dynamic maps of community resources
  A community calendar
  Support for video

While we received a substantial grant from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation as a winner of the Knight News Challenge, we still need your support to make our project a success.

Support Davis Wiki with a taxdeductible contribution today.  Visit {{{http://kck.st/a5vx43}}} to make a pledge to our project on Kickstarter  we wont take your donation until we reach our $25,000 goal!

As always, we welcome you to get involved with the Davis Wiki, and encourage you to contribute your knowledge and thoughts.  Thank you for your contributions of both money and knowledge to the Davis Wiki, and for helping continue to make Davis Wiki the best online community resource on the planet.

 Philips suggestions 


File(philip_flyer_long.pdf) and File(philip_flyer_long.odt) (you probably dont have the fonts use the PDF to print)

I think the right idea is to have both printed  print a few sheets of mini flyer and hand out to everyone.  The longer form flyer  well, I guess its not even really a flyer  can be handed out as a hey, more info! document.  Users/PhilipNeustrom
