20100219 20:18:27 nbsp Please dont wipe out the existing pages.  Theres about 40 or 50 people who have been contributing actively on that page, and expect it to be there, and many ideas for how to attract Google. Users/IDoNotExist

20100219 21:02:55 nbsp please stop doing that.  Seriously. Users/IDoNotExist

20100219 21:12:36 nbsp There.  Everybody happy now? Users/IDoNotExist

20100220 10:55:53 nbsp Look at the comment from last night... someone thinks its first comment on the issue.  Your additional page is just confusing people. Users/TomGarberson
  I agree that with Tom and others that we need fewer pages, and that we shouldnt hide the discussion in a Talk page where people wont know where it is.  But perhaps the Gigabit Ethernet page should redirect to the Google Fiber page, rather than the other way around, since Gigabit Ethernet isnt an accurate description..
   Thatd be fine with me.  Just so long as it gets down to one single page. tg
    I also agree that there should be one page, but that first one was very unreadable and didnt appeal to the target audience. If anything, that comment demonstrates that people who are casually surfing think that the new page seems more like an actual wiki article on the topic.

20100220 15:27:46 nbsp Please cut it out. You come on here and create duplicate pages and make it difficult for people to fix the mess you caused. Let JabberWokky finish what hes doing. I promise hes better at this than you. Users/WilliamLewis
