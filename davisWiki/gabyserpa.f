20090409 20:38:15 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. I restored the timestamp and signature for your comment on Grace Valley Christian Center. Each page maintains a http://daviswiki.org/Grace_Valley_Christian_Center?actioninfo history of changes, so removing those sort of things is pretty pointless. Users/JasonAller

20090410 08:54:30 nbsp Hi, I thought you made a useful comment on Grace Valley Christian Center, we have another page, Grace Valley Christian Center/Experiences Experiences with some other discussion about that topic. Feel free to add your comment again and as long as you understand youre not totally anonymous in what you write here if thats your real name, its fine with me if you dont want to put your name on the comment.

20090410 13:18:41 nbsp Hi, and welcome to the wiki.  Im sorry your first experiences here havent gone entirely smoothly.  I agree with Nick.  We (including you) are all equal editors here, and sometimes editors agree and sometimes they disagree.  But I think that Jason is ok with you putting your comment back without signing your name to it.  I thought you made some very good comments and would welcome you to come back and put them on the Grace Valley Christian Center/Experiences page.  As Nick said, you still wouldnt be fully anonymous  as you can see, I am pretty much anonymous here, though I know that if someone were determined enough they could figure out who I am.  I assume that most people arent that determined, though. Users/CovertProfessor

20090414 10:22:24 nbsp Thank you for http://daviswiki.org/Grace_Valley_Christian_Center/Experiences?actiondiff&version2111&version1110 sharing on the Grace Valley Christian Center GVCC page.  I understand the fear of declaring the truth.  After leaving GVCC I mailed an article on spiritual abuse out to everyone in the church directory.  Reverend P. G. Mathew Pastor Mathew wrote me a personal letter accusing me of trying to destroy Gods church and demanding that we meet with him and the elders.  By then we had the protection of the pastor at University Covenant Church and he advised us not to meet with them.  As Users/CliftonBurton Clif Burton points out, If you havent been in the compound, you cant relate to the fear...  Fear is a means of control.  Recovering From Spiritual Abuse Sharing our story here on the Davis Wiki has been a part of my healing.  You are not alone! Lord bless you!   Users/RichLindvall
