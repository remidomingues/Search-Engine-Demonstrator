Welcome to the Wiki Howdy, Mr. or Ms. Gager, and Welcome to the Wiki!   You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you (or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here).  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  You made quite a strong worded edit to the Tom Waltz entry, and I gave you a reply there that will hopefully clarify that the fairly nasty nickname is not an invention of the wiki editors, but an regrettably common term in use.  If you are sure about his height, but all means please correct it... the entire wiki  every single last word of it  was built by people like you working together to improve each entry.  If you see something incorrect in the future, rather than tossing personal insults at people, please work with everybody here... were all trying to document and provide a resource for Davis together.

Discussion about the editing of an entry usually goes into a talk page (see the icon at the top).  These are all conventions that People weve all worked out so everybody can edit together without (much) conflict, kind of like table manners.  A good basic rule of thumb is that adding more information is always good, while taking away information isnt... which often means adding a new opinion rather than deleting one you disagree with.  When signed comments are deleted, somebody usually comes along and restores them (to protect their opinion).  Its all pretty simple, but like any community, there are a handful of customs that it takes awhile to learn.  Thanks for correcting the entry, though... if you know anything else about the Davis Police Department, it would be great if you could contribute. Keep in mind that a large number of people from very different backgrounds all contribute, so adding your voice to theirs is a good thing.Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20080824 13:24:20 nbsp I can understand having a short fuse on an issue like that if youve been dealing with it your entire life. As to changing your name, youve pretty well established who you are here so I think that it is much less of an issue. There are several editors Users/JabberWokky included who edit under a name other than their own, but who have none the less established their identities and reputations here. Users/JasonAller

20080826 21:00:59 nbsp Gager, there is a hidden reference that invisibly draws people who search for the term to the page so they can educate instead of perpetuate, or something like that Users/StevenDaubert

20080826 21:25:48 nbsp So after ridding the wiki of the term are you going to tackle the other sites that use the term with specific reference to Davis? If so Id be interested to know how well that works out and if Davis Wiki was harder to work with or easier to work with than other sites. Users/JasonAller

20080826 22:24:09 nbsp best of luck convincing the wiki to remove it, several people have apparently championed this, and it make sense (ive seen jw phrase it eloquently) besides, this instance is left only to point people in the right direction. They search a term and find out someone has a name, etc.  Bring it up in the talk page, but frankly I dont see you winning over the hearts and minds this time, every other reference on the wiki has been removed. Users/StevenDaubert
{{{##}}} will comment something out on a page, make it invisible but you can see it when you edit. The reason its not working its magic right now is Ive escaped it by surrounding it with 3 { and }. Leaving the term commented out like that makes it so someone searches the term and gets the page Tom Waltz, then they get the chance to better inform themselves. Or so we would hope.
