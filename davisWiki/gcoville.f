Im Gilbert.

Ive been watching DavisWiki since I moved to Davis in early 2007.  6 years later, Ive finally decided to start editing.

I am the local moderator for Davis Freecycle.

Im into vintage computing, Linux and Mac OS X.

My longstanding goal has been to do something with the Lost Pets page.  What a disaster.


Welcome to the wiki, sort of!  Users/PhilipNeustrom

20130105 17:47:41 nbsp Welcome to the wiki. I already like the cut of your jib Users/StevenDaubert

20130106 20:22:06 nbsp Wow.  Amazing yeoman job on the Lost Pets page.  You can actually see whats going on now. Users/CovertProfessor
  Thanks.  I think now the page can stay sane with minimal ongoing effort.  My hope is that with a more consistent format, information on Lost Pets will be easier to find and easier to create.  Then eventually, maybe it will become the first place in Davis where folks go when they lose or find a pet.  I want to explore ways to make it even easier for new wiki users to add their entry.  Users/gcoville

20130107 13:15:58 nbsp Thanks for all your work on the Lost Pets page! Users/MeggoWaffle
  It has been bugging me for years.  Its definitely a difficult problem in that most people editing that page are new to daviswiki editing and probably distraught and in a hurry.  Providing instructions for them to get going is a delicate balance between being extremely detailed about what they need to do, yet not too verbose.  Well have to see how it works out.  I look forward to suggestions for more improvement.  Users/gcoville
   I have no idea how to go about this, but it might be even easier for people if there was a sort of form to fill in, like there is for the events board. Headline, location last seen, description, contact info, and link to a picture (so they dont have to figure out how to load, resize, etc). But looking at the event board it seems like you cant edit any entries, and they disappear once passed, so there would have to be a way to keep pets on until found (despite the date attached to the entry), and be able to remove them at will.

20130110 15:39:25 nbsp I want to echo what everyone else has said.  Thank you so much for all your great work on that page. Users/TomGarberson

20130110 21:12:30 nbsp most impressive.  Users/StevenDaubert

20130110 21:12:57 nbsp also DOS much? Users/StevenDaubert
   I never did use DOS much.  Most of my vintage computing interest ends in the early 80s.  I found (and still do find) the x86 and PC to be mostly uninteresting.  Users/gcoville
 Slightly before my time then. 7 inch floppy was the thing to do on my first computer that booted to ROTT, F15E microprose simulator, or DOS (from which you could launch windows 95 if you wanted some turbo tax) ~SD

20130113 13:00:39 nbsp Wiley.  That amused me. Users/JabberWokky
  There could be no other name!  Users/gcoville

20130114 01:24:21 nbsp Youre my Wiki hero these days. Good to see an active editor doing so much good stuff. Just wanted to say that.  Users/DonShor
  Thanks.  Im still getting uptospeed on this particular wikiculture.  In the meantime, theres plenty of straightforward stuff to do.  Users/gcoville

20130125 13:04:57 nbsp Hi, I didnt delete the defenderfer page because its mispelled, I deleted it because he already has a business page called good shepherd counseling or something and a user page.  Users/LoriOrf

20130224 10:03:16 nbsp Hope you dont mind... I took the liberty of cropping your awesome crop dusting photos to get rid of some of the lens crud and highlight the planes a little better! Users/CovertProfessor
  Thanks!  Theyre much more dramatic now. Users/gcoville

20130821 22:41:10 nbsp Google not only uses your login information to give you more relevant results, but location and other magical tracking methods as well. You might be getting the UC Davis incident since you are located in Davis. I on the other hand, even in incognito mode, get links to Amazon. Users/hankim

  Yes, I agree with Han here.  Using private browsing mode in SF the results dont appear, so its likely just because youre in that area while performing the search.   Users/PhilipNeustrom

 Ah, I see now.  My screenshot is particularly tailored to Davis internet users, and perhaps even to me.  Ill take it down. Users/gcoville

20131010 08:27:53 nbsp Ack! Someone deleted the Lost Pets page!!! Users/JenniferH

 Imagine a world where no pet ever went missing.  Ahh.  Oh well, it looks like Users/jefftolentino and Users/LizPhillips sorted it out.  Users/gcoville
