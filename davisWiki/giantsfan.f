What up Mr. England, welcome to the wiki, I would tell you to watch out for Jason Aller pointing out the importance of using your real name, and that next to the save changes button when you edit a page is the preview button, you can make several small changes without cluttering recent changes. Welcome to the wiki! Its always nice to see people who represent business get in touch with the community! Switching gears now but I recently had the pleasure of going to a luxo box when the As played at giants, It was big pimpin spending Gs for sure, and to top if off the As crushed em!

have a great day, and if you have any questions about the wiki dont hesitate to ask.  Users/StevenDaubert
post script I have an extra 50 year commemorative bandana that I got for being one of the first 10,000 or whatnot, just say the word and its yours! My dad listened to the As when I was a kid, so thats why Im not really a giants fan... But as long as its Bay Area its all legit in my book.
