Jen is wonderful and helps me better understand my skin issues. I try and see her on a monthly basis and she is very professional and does not push products. Shes been very flexible with scheduling and I cannot say enough about her services! She is careful and addresses specific concerns and my skin has never looked better!! Users/Llonianderes

Portland Oregon ( a natural and organic Mecca)  and luck out is an understatement! Jenn is SO great at what he does and I have never had such excellent customer service. Professional, clean, green, and so relaxing  my waxing experiences here have been like dreamy spa heaven! She is so nice and meticulous and you can tell she loves what she does! I am totally thrilled to have such a great place to go for natural waxing and facials. I highly recommend this place!! Users/Freedomrainbow

20121205 08:42:48 nbsp Jen has the fun job of waxing my legs every two weeks... I feel blessed to know her (for so long!)and to have a place i can go relax, wax and laugh w her. Its a treat! Her location is easy, with great parking in back and she is the best in town at what she does. I have had the pleasure of a few GGG facials as well, this is the ultimate treat... treat yourself, or buy a gift cert. for a friend. You will not regret... go get blissed. I love GGG and Jen, big fan. Users/erindunning
