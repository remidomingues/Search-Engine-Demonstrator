20120207 22:40:26 nbsp Thank you very much for your reply and for reviewing the comments.  I apologize, but I just replied on the ComfortSuites/Talk page.

I use daviswiki on a daily basis for personal and business and find it an invaluable resource.  I recognize a few of your user names and now I know why this site isnt overrun by spam.

Thanks again,

20120208 07:34:48 nbsp Just so you know, the accusations against Friendly Cab by Josh Lawson about DUIs, drug abuse, lack of insurance, etc. appear to have been completely made up.  Lawson more or less admitted that it was all stories, and Art, the owner of the cab company, asked me to look over some insurance and DMV records.  From those documents, it was pretty clear that the accusations from Lawson were false. Users/TomGarberson
