20100113 22:45:53 nbsp Hey  I saw you uploaded some images, but they were named with .aspx extensions.  They need to end in .jpg for them to work correctly.  I downloaded, renamed them and am about to upload them with the correct name so they can go in.  If you need help with future ones, just ask. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
