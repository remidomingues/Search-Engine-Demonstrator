20081117 22:01:02 nbsp  Welcome to the Wiki. Please consider the importance of using your RealName. Isnt the road in the picture you added to Putah Creek County Road 98 instead of Old Davis Road? Users/JasonAller

20081117 22:14:29 nbsp Oh, perhaps. Weve never seen any sign there but the other picture on the Putah Creek page looked very familiar so I thought it might be it... Does County Road 98 go over Putah Creek on a bridge that has graffiti on its underside and a wellused bike path?  Users/gurglemeow

20081117 22:16:48 nbsp Just south of the campus landfill and the primate center? Users/JasonAller

20081118 14:05:49 nbsp Not sure, have never seen either of those things... Its southwestish from the DANR buildings and perhaps a ~10 minute bike ride west from the University Airport. (Im really bad with directions though) Users/gurglemeow
  Yup, that would be County Road 98. Users/JasonAller

20081118 21:18:58 nbsp Thanks! I fixed the title on the Putah Creek page. Users/gurglemeow

20081124 21:35:38 nbsp Your photovisions and wikiclickies are quite impressive! Users/IDoNotExist

20081124 21:45:47 nbsp What do you think of the UC Davis Principles Of Community? Users/JasonAller

20081124 22:03:26 nbsp Thanks, o nonexistent one! JasonAller  I do not go to or plan to go to UCD but those principles seem quite admirable, if they are upheld. It seems like the sort of the thing the average student wouldnt actually know and/or follow, though, even IF they received pamphlets saying so. Why do you ask? Are you going to use it against me in an argument supporting the right to bear arms? (I just discovered the Students for Concealed Carry on Campus SCCC page and now Im wary, heh...) Users/gurglemeow
  The campus version gets more play, but there is also Principles of One Community. Im not going to use it against you, but the question was asked in response to http://daviswiki.org/Students_for_Concealed_Carry_on_Campus?actiondiff&version2227&version1226 your comment. I find the topic revealing, but largely unproductive to discuss in a setting like the wiki. The only time Ive seen people of differing viewpoints make progress on the issue is either one on one, or in a small group. The same can be said of other personal choice issues. However this one issue does serve as a very valuable touchstone into how people view themselves. Users/JasonAller
     Ah I see, yes I agree. I know my comment didnt add anything to the page and I expected/wont mind if it gets deleted. But I could see that an argument had already been started and for some reason couldnt help expressing my sadness on the whole business. I think DavisWiki should have a forum, though, wherein pages could link to their specific forum rooms, and discussions on the forums would generally be kept away from the main page unless they were informative, unbiased truths, or in the case of businesses, useful, legitimate reviews. (Wait... IS there a forum? Must explore more) Users/gurglemeow
     SCCC members are not expected to stand by and take insults. That said, I fail to find anything offensive in that comment and see no reason to delete it. And yes, I am still liberal enough to recognize that it is a sad business. Unfortunately, its the world we live in, and I feel it would be unproductive at best to ignore it. As for a forum, JabberWocky just created a discussion page related to SCCC, should be under the recent changes tab. Users/BrendanChan
      Gurgle Meow: I think your forum idea is a good one.  For now, it seems like the Talk pages try to serve that purpose, but a forum attached to each wiki entry would be a logical next step in the addition of features to this type of wiki.Users/TheAmazingLarry
      Excellent! I personally would have no idea how to go about creating an interlocked forum, but I hope someone does. :) Users/gurglemeow

20101020 09:15:50 nbsp I do not know what Dr. Trans office policy is but it would be very unusual for you to be charged for a repair on dental work that was just completed.  All dentists and specialists I work with will not charge for repairs or touch ups if the work was done recently.  You can also call his office to verify that you would not be charged.

20120321 10:36:12 nbsp Ooh... you want to scan that menu and upload it? Users/TomGarberson

20120321 14:57:12 nbsp Tom, I dont have a scanner but I took pictures of the menu. Just heading out the door now but Ill put them up another day. :) Users/gurglemeow
