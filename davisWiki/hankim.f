You may find him trying to get the wiki:campbell Front Page Campbell Wiki up and running. Hes also always in the mood for Burgers and Brew. He moved back towiki:campbell Front Page Campbell after graduating and then San Francisco and doesnt really check this Wiki as often anymore. If you need to get in contact with him for some reason, you can probably bother a Wiki Gnome and have them contact him.

Although Han is usually a shutin who Front Page lurks http://forum.bodybuilding.com/forumdisplay.php?f19  around http://www.4chan.org on wiki:Campbell the http://www.1up.com/boards/forums/show/32116.page internets, you might have caught him lurking in real life at the following locations:
  Droms Comics and Cards  Either http://www.starcitygames.com/magic/fundamentals/12549_Learning_How_To_Draft.html drafting, playing http://www.dragonhighlander.net/rules.php Elder Dragon Highlander, picking up his http://img269.imageshack.us/img269/9593/batmandawg.jpg comics, or eating lunch.

  Activities and Recreation Center  Usually lifting. Hey, he might not agree with how it is run, but he is still paying for it.
  XCoffee House  He might http://www.ucdbs.com/asucdfees disagree with the ASUCD on almost everything, but tuna salad on a bagel here costs only a few dimes more than it would if he made it himself.X Bagels here are sort of disgusting, they fall apart and leave a weird aftertaste in your mouth.
  XTrolling ASUCD campaigners and CalPIRG solicitors at the Memorial UnionX (since getting a job, Han prefers to make money rather than futilely fight those in the ASUCD Senate Office Ivory Tower).
