If the page has a comment box, just type it in there, if the page doesnt have a comment box you can add one by editing the page and adding {{{Comments}}} which will put a comment box on the page. If the page doesnt exist yet you can create the page by searching for the name of the business and opting to create a page for it and using the restaurant template. Users/JasonAller
