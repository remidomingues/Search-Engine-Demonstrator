A poor soul hoping to relocate to Davis and desperately trying to learn all about it before then. In particular, Im trying to figure out:
  Where to get an affordable (on a graduate student budget) 2bedroom place to live that allows 2 15lb dogs and an infant
  Whether I can manage to Carfree in Davis not buy a car if I plan to go to Stockton regularly to visit my family and UCDMC Bus Line to Sacramento daily to study at School of Medicine UCD Medical School
  Where I can get the best Mexican Food tacos in the area
  Where the best grocery story around is. We love to cook and use esoteric ingredients like quinoa and saffron, but would be fine with a place that has affordable goodquality produce (we can get random spices and things in bulk elsewhere).


20090322 22:56:03 nbsp Affordable Housing in Davis is sort of relative; if youre from the Davis Midwest Connection Midwest and used to those housing prices, anything in California will come as a shock.  To get to Stockton via public transit, you can take almost any Amtrak train from Davis to Sacramento (the http://www.amtrak.com/timetable/oct08/W34.pdf Capitol Corridor runs quite frequently), and then take the http://www.amtrak.com/timetable/oct08/W33.pdf San Joaquins to Stockton. To get to the UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento, you can take the UCDMC Bus Line direct from the UCD campus.  As for tacos and grocery store, I think peoples preferences are based mostly on personal taste, but youll find lots of different opinions on the Wiki.  Welcome! Users/MaryLieth

20090322 23:03:21 nbsp If you tell us what qualities you like in a grocery store, it will be easier to recommend one.  Users/CovertProfessor

20090322 23:36:13 nbsp I wonder if you mean to study at the UCD medical school.  The UCSD one is in Southern California, and would be quite a commute.

As it sounds like you are a student, you might want to check out Orchard Park or Solano Park.  As a grad student with kids, you can get into grad student campus family housing, which is (relatively) inexpensive. Users/IDoNotExist

  20090421 nbsp I did indeed mean UCD, of course. Duly corrected. Orchard and Solano Parks sound great, except they dont allow dogs. I had no idea that finding a dogfriendly place was so difficult!  Users/harvardslacker

20090323 04:10:28 nbsp Its generally a good idea to call about things like the dogs at University Court, because the wiki can be more accurate than their website.  Its often a case where somebody who has a dog and is living there edited that page.  The wiki is easy to update; some of those company websites are based on stock templates and never updated to match reality.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

  20090421 nbsp The wiki says University Court doesnt allow dogs. Im hoping that theres some place that unofficially allows dogs even though theyre officially prohibited, which is the case with my current apartment in Columbia Univ. housing in New York. So far, though, I havent seen any sign of that in the oncampus Davis apartment complexes. Users/harvardslacker

20090323 04:18:58 nbsp Incidentally, I used to do a weekly Stockton/Davis trip by car.  Even by car, its doable, but you really need to want to do it.  I also used to do a daily Sacto/Davis trip for awhile, from well on the other end of Sacramento.  Thats really easy and enjoyable, both by car and by rail, although as Mary notes, theres a bus line that takes you right there, whereas the rail puts you on the opposite end of downtown from the UCDMC.

20090602 14:33:31 nbsp What exactly are you looking to Fact Check?  That tag is often use in humor as a parody of Wikipedia, and I wasnt sure if you were using it seriously or not. Users/JabberWokky
  Ah, I didnt realize that. Im new to the Davis Wiki and am confused by the proliferation of contradictory comments that arent subsequently clarified and pared down... I think I put that beneath something very random and minor like how spaces at the Farmers Market are assigned... Users/harvardslacker

20090602 17:19:32 nbsp Hi, If youre interested in housing that allows dogs: check out the Davis Affordable Housing link and get on the waiting list ASAP. Im pretty sure a few of those places accept dogs.If youre able to though, look into renting a duplex and then youll have happy kids and dog b/c you would have a yard. As for grocery stores, depends on what kind of person you are. If I had the money, as in enough not to worry about how much I spend every week, I would go to the Nugget. There are also some decent rentals in that area behind Nugget...  Users/jsbmeb

20090602 18:25:37 nbsp I think the reason the fact check thing can be used satirically here is because pretty much everyone has the same ability to check facts. The topics are not so diverse here as on WikiPedia or hard to look at, so feel free to find out how things are yourself and update the wiki. In this particular situation you might want to contact Randii MacNear, who runs the market. Thanks! Users/NickSchmalenberger
