20080513 19:54:50 nbsp I can only offer opinion on your recent request about archiving a recent comment that was discussing events from a while ago. Id have to say that Id side on retaining it as archiving is less about the content of the comments and more about when they were left. In this particular instance the commenter even makes mention of the fact that they are discussing something that happened prior to a change in management. You might try asking the Wiki Community, maybe there will be a consensus that is different. Users/JasonAller
