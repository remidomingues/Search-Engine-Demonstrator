Havanese is a husband and wife Graduate Students gradstudent pair.  We are long time voyeurs on daviswiki but only recently created a profile.

20071218 09:58:34 nbsp Saw your note on the Planet Beach Tanning entry... you can change the name of any entry by clicking Edit and then (down at the bottom, next to the Save and Preview buttons), click the Rename button.  In general, most entries are named after the full name of the business or group (not the full legal name with Inc, or whatever... just the full formal name).  In cases where its almost always referred to by a shorter name (The Aggie is what everybody calls The California Aggie newspaper), a redirect is often placed in the shorter form. Users/JabberWokky
