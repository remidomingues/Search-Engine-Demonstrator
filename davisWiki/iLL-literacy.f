iLLliteracy is a spoken word collective performance group, which used to be on the UCD campus.
Now, the offcampus group, started by Adriel Luis and Ruby VeridianoChing, is based in the San Francisco Bay area and tours all across the country.
They address pertinent topics including Race & Ethnicity race, sex and identity.
iLLliteracy also started to publish an independent art magazine called Phlegm.

Many of the remaining iLLiteracy poets still on the Davis campus, have created a group called SickSpits.


The site shows the new developments of the group after it left the Davis campus.
