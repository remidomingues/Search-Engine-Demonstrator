20081022 14:41:13 nbsp We have since started taking our dog to 29 Palms Pet Resort.  Its kind of in between Davis and Woodland.  We have left our dog here a couple times and were satisfied with the quality of care she got there.  Our dog is older so we always ask that she is kenneled in the seniors section at 29 Palms.  We did visit the kennel before we decided to leave her there, along with 3 other kennels in the Davis/Woodland area, and we liked that one the best.  Good luck!   Users/recoveringPhD

20090824 06:13:20 nbsp You wrote a really rude comment to me on the review page for a coffeehouse called Espresso Metropolitan in Sacramento. In all the world, I will never understand why some people seem to get off on being mean for no reason, as you were in your post to me.  If I gave a bad review to another coffeehouse or cafe, it was because that was my HONEST opinion on that particular business. I dont have any special interest in Espresso Metropolitan other than that I have been a longtime customer there; I have given great reviews to Butch N Nellies coffeehouse/cafe, but dont have  any special interest in that place, either. I believe, however, that they deserve an excellent review.  A cafe called The Coffee Garden is another one I really like.  I have not found very many cafes in Sac that impress me, and I have every right to post my opinion without being attacked by a stranger for doing so.  It sounds to me like YOU have a special interest in a certain cafe, since you were so defensive about the review I gave to it.   Users/SisterRags
