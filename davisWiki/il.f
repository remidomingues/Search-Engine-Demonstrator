20080508 09:28:12 nbsp Hey, I dont know about publicity this year, but in the past everyone knew about the coop party during WEF..?  I think there were even posters up around advertising the bands?  Maybe, if its a problem, the reference to the coop could be removed and the pictures / rest of text remain? (Every year theres a big party accompanying WEF..?) Users/PhilipNeustrom
