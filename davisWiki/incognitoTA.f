20071103 04:56:11 nbsp Thank you so much for your comment on the RFSA page!!! Youre so right about it being next to impossible to trust again.  How great that youve made contact there at UCC!  The worst thing is when people dont give Jesus a second chance because theyve been abused by a wolf in sheeps clothing.  I love the account in John 9 where Jesus heals the man born blind, then the young man is abused by the church leaders, thrown out, and then Jesus comes to him.  I can relate to that fellow.  Im him!  May the Lord continue to heal youand to use you in the healing of others who have undergone similar abuse! (2 Cor. 1:34.) Users/RichLindvall
