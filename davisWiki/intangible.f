20070809 09:43:06 nbsp Hi, I just saw your comment on the Primary Concepts page, and that you got a tatoo from Kai.  Im doing a profile for The California Aggie about Kai and her tatoo work.  It would be awesome if I could ask you a few questions about it.  Please email me if so: Mailto(krberrey AT ucdavis DOT edu).  Thanks, and I hope you have a great day!!
