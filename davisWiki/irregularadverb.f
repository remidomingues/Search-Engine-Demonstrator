Your comment on Privy Computer Diagnostics kicked off a little discussion because you posted it from the same IP address as Users/PKS. It gave the appearance that PKS might have created this account in order to post a positive comment about his business. You can undo that appearance by making positive edits to the wiki which can take the form of reviews of other business, creating pages, uploading photos, answering other peoples questions, or just adding information about Davis  especially the little, enjoyable things.
