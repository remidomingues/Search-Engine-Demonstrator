20081112 15:21:15 nbsp Hey, itayneta... you can mark a business as being closed by adding {{{Include(Departed Business)}}} to the top of the entry.  Or, if it is not a business (like a group or event that no longer exists), you can use {{{Include(NoLongerExists)}}}.  That adds the nice big notice seen at Futon Emporium now.  Also, if you know anything about the business, now is the time to add it to preserve any history you happen to remember. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
