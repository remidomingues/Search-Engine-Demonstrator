I just moved to the area from So Cal in the middle of August; YEAH, HOT!! I brought my wife, 3 kids, 2 dogs and a pet lizard. We love the Davis community and all it has to offer.

I AM A TRUE BELIVER IN THE DAVIS WIKI. IT’S GREAT. YOU NEED FOOD, TYPE IN FOOD. ANYTYING YOU NEED IT’S FASTER AND MORE RELIABLE THAN GOOGLE. The comments are what make the wiki so great, so everyone should add their two cents.

See the page I created.
