Howdy, Mr. or Ms. Tang!  I renamed the entry about the event to From Spoke to Sprocket, as it probably isnt the only bike related exhibition in the past and future of Davis.  :)   Seriously, though... I added a bunch of links out from the entry, but it would probably be a good idea to link to the entry from the various bike and art related entries.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
