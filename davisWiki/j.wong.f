20100719 01:28:27 nbsp Hello, Ms. or Mr. Wong and Welcome to the Wiki.  As far as I am aware, yes anyone can start a fraternity in the sense that any two male individuals can share a brotherhood of sorts.  Most classically, this is through some sort of trust building exercise.  Your comment about Psi Chi Omega being composed of homesexuals is not appreciated.  Many residents of Davis are Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Resource Center LGBT and would probably take offense at being likened to some fraternity http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?termbro Bros.  You may take the time to introduce yourself and build an Identity if you would like to be a constructive member of the community Users/MasonMurray

20100719 09:51:44 nbsp I deleted your comment.  I hope you come back to edit the wiki in a way that does not involve making personal attacks on people. Users/CovertProfessor
