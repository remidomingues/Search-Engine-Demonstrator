Hi Janette, welcome to the wiki. Do you know anything else about Strands? I know there are a few comments on the Tangles entry, but your note says that it isnt connected to Tangles. Could you possibly update the Strands entry with new information?

A few other notes, since youre new: we generally try to keep departed business entries around, even though the businesses themselves arent here any longer. So I brought the Tangles entry back to life (and also gave Strands its own entry) and included a note indicating its gone. Also, its not good to leave an entry completely blank, like you http://daviswiki.org/Users/KaraSmith?actiondiff&version24&version13 did to Users/KaraSmith Kara Smiths entry. If she doesnt work there anymore, it would be better to leave a note indicating otherwise, with your signature so people know that you were the one leaving the note.

Feel free to ask me or other editors any other questions you have! Most of us are pretty friendly :) And I encourage you to keep editing other entries! Again, welcome to the wiki!  Users/ElleWeber
