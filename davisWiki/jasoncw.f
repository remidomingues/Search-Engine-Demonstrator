20100528 04:22:47 nbsp Hi Jason, by your post on Ducks, its very clear that you feel strongly about them. Wheres the policy that says the University doesnt care about ducks?  Users/jsbmeb

20100528 07:52:53 nbsp I would phrase it to say that ducks love bread... which is a horrible thing, as it leads to their death.  Dogs also love antifreeze and will contentedly lap it up, leading to their demise.  The love is their reaction, which, in this case, leads to a rather horrible end result.  Saying they hate bread implies they will ignore or avoid it if you toss some their way. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
  I agree.  If the ducks hated bread, they wouldnt eat it.  Ducks love bread like humans love fatty, sugary foods.  In both cases, the foods we love are bad for us. Users/CovertProfessor

20110601 06:19:05 nbsp Whoa. That comment I made was like a year ago almost exactly.
So in response, we are essentially talking about the same thing? The arboretum is maintained by UCD and its on University property. The people who take care of it are employed by the UCD Grouds department and the UCD Arboretum is the non profit that takes care of admin end and donations, etc.  Users/jsbmeb

20110601 07:26:38 nbsp Im not the individual who used the term hate.  More importantly, youve gone way overboard in hyper analyzing the language here.  I just didnt want an overly simplistic wording that lead people to feed the ducks bread.  The philosophical argument is neat, but for two things: one, Im not the one who invoked the term hate (or, the implied love).  Two, I only care about the practical wording of content on the wiki so that it conveys the correct overall meaning.  Quite frankly, I think you would be horrified if we actually got into a discussion about animal motivations, but then, I have very little anthropomorphic projection upon our furry and feathered friends (I say that with a wink).  But either of our views has very little to do with the practical wording of the content in question. Users/JabberWokky

20110601 09:34:04 nbsp sorry, just one more thing I thought of... I also have never seen dead ducks. but if I did, it most likely would be because of predators or the fact that they walk in the roads. Most people, including me, slow down and have been known to wait for a long time sometimes for the ducks to get out of the road. I believe the university doesnt get involved in the duck issue is because they are considered wild and its the natural course of things that they die sometimes, especially whe theyreia more urban environment. As far as over population, I dont know about it and dont know why Im responding more to this anyway, so ill stop before i get ahead of myself. Users/jsbmeb

20110601 09:39:43 nbsp I dont know why youre quibbling about this  you and I agree that the ducks shouldnt be given bread.  It would be nice if we (ducks and humans) hated the things that were bad for us, but unfortunately, we dont.   Users/CovertProfessor

20110601 10:55:31 nbsp Hey Jason, I get your point but I agree with JW saying youre overanalyzing the word.  Bread is bad for ducks, but the usage of the word hate seems odd to me.

Its like saying that kids hate sugar and candy.  They eat it due to instinct (humans evolved to crave sugar and fats), not love.  Kids hate candy because (a) they can choke on it if theyre young and die, (b) it affects their digestion and they get sick or sugar rushes, (c) its unhealthy and it causes weight gain, as well as increasing risk of diabetes and later on heart problems, (d) it can affect their energy levels and make them more likely to lose at dodgeball.

Youre giving reasons why they should hate it, and I think everyone agrees with you.  Ducks shouldnt be given bread.  Neither should kids be given tons of candy and soda from a young age (child obesity just continues on to worse things as they age...).  However, I dont think hate is the appropriate word in the context it was being used.  As JW said, the more important context is the practical wording that is commonly used in everyday discussion.  I think most people, if you told them kids hate sugar and candy would think youre crazy.  If you said they generally crave it and go for it instinctively but its bad for them and they shouldnt...closer to the mark. Not the best analogy of course, but just a quick comparison on word play.

This posting was not meant unkindly.  Users/EdWins

20111213 08:15:37 nbsp Ok...I would just like to say, I have no idea why you want to keep this going. I dont even know what your point is. It is and has been a dead issue for me. So this is the last response I will make about this. Have a great day :) Users/jsbmeb
