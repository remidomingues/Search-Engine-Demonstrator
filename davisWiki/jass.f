20100207 14:42:50 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. I noticed the comment you left for Daubert about Aggie Liquor. What did you mean by didnt get it approved by the owner? Daubert, you and the rest of us are all editors here on the wiki and the wiki is only as accurate and good as we make it together. No one owns any of the pages other than their userpage, and that is still open to other people leaving comments and communications. Read the Welcome to the Wiki page and the pages linked from there, they might help clear up a few things about what Davis Wiki is and is not. Users/JasonAller
