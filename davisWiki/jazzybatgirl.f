20081020 22:59:59 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy Jazzy.  Should the Parks & Community Services Department entry be renamed?  You can rename it if you know the new title by clicking the Rename button in the editor, or Id be happy to... I just am not sure what the new official name is.  I was also hoping that if you knew anything about the split (when it happened, who was involved, etc), you could add a little information about it to the entry so we can have a historical record of the department.
