When I first heard about DOSiRAK opening, I was excited that I might be able to just bike a few blocks to get some Korean food that I have recently been constantly in the mood for. Then I saw  the very poorly covered up Sockpuppets sock puppeting on the page (the comments looked suspicious even before I checked the IP addresses) and it turned me off from ever wanting to try out your place (if you are indeed affiliated with the restaurant, also please read the Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner page). If you are not affiliated with the restaurant, good job ruining the business reputation and you got me. Users/hankim
