Hello,

Every apartment at Stonegate village that isnt remodeled gets remodeled when the tenants move out. New texture, paint, carpet, cabinets, etc. They do a crazy amount of work in the summer to each of the units, each one is being brought up to the new remodel color scheme, the old cabinets are dark, the new are tan.
