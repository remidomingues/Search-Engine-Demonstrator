20080621 13:58:31 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy, Mr. or Ms. Clay, and Welcome to the Wiki!   My names Evan, pleased to meet you!   The Hoffmann Automotive entry has 18 comments, only five of which are negative.  I dont know if Id call that a bad batting average with the general public.  :)  At least two of them were just complaining about price, and I know I always feel lousy at the price of car repair anywhere.  Regardless, Im glad you spoke up with your take on them.  Once again, welcome to the wiki. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
