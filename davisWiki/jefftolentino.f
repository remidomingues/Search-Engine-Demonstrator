 Hello my name is Jeff 



Hi Ian Tillman!

 Pictures 
I enjoy taking pictures. Photography is cool.

Here are some pictures Ive taken:
 
 
You can see more stuff on my http://www.flickr.com/photos/62715248@N00/ flickr account.
 
I also do the Random Camera project, which includes silly pictures like these:
 
I also like to make photograms with instant film. Here are some polagrams Ive made:

Is your brother James Tolentino? If so, I went to school with him. Users/JamesSchwab

Yes, James is my brother. Hes doing graphic design in Venice Beach. He also enlightened me on bacon dogs. Users/JeffTolentino


Nice watermelon picture!
Protip: preview is your friend if you want to make a series of edits on a page Users/StevenDaubert


hmmmm, did some fooling around and seems to work if I enter the time as 4:00PM (6 and a half hours later). Shows 4:00PM to when im logged in, and 9:30AM when im logged out. Noticed different times on other events too.  from the Events Board/Talk page. What is your time zone set to in your user settings (under your name in the upper right)? Users/PhilipNeustrom

20070825 15:33:40 nbsp Thanks for the comment bar, philip. Ive been meaning to do that. :) Users/jefftolentino

20070903 06:43:12 nbsp Great picture of Richards bike tunnel Users/EdHenn

20070904 18:27:58 nbsp Thanks for the good editing. Sometimes {{{Include(PhotoRequest)}}} are left on a page to get a noncopyrighted picture or to get a better picture. Users/JasonAller

20070905 00:29:50 nbsp Heh, I didnt connect the you from this page and the you from the bike rides until just now. Ive checked on your page before because Ive wondered if youre related to a Leto Tolentino, who also lives in Davis and went to high school with my mom. Are you? Users/ElisaHough

20070905 11:52:56 nbsp Yes, my mom too. She also tells me that you came to my first birthday party. Users/ElisaHough

20070912 09:42:39 nbsp Jeff thank you for helping I somehow erased the Events Board and had no idea how to undo this!! Users/MaryBurke

20070918 22:39:15 nbsp Hey, Jeff. Congratulations on such a cool mystery picture. I especially like the metal milk box because its a relic from Daviss earlier years. Users/robinlaughlin

20070919 15:40:28 nbsp Random Page is definitely the way to avoid Recent Changes braindeath! Users/PhilipNeustrom

20070921 16:59:20 nbsp When I went to Sly Park, my buddy and I built the best shelter of anybody, but we didnt get to sleep in it. Did you graduate from DHS? Maybe you should add yourself to Graduates of the Davis Joint Unified School District. Users/NickSchmalenberger

20070926 00:04:50 nbsp Full moon ride tonight at 9 pm, meet in Central Park! Maybe Ill bring pictures of us as kids. Users/ElisaHough

20070926 19:34:31 nbsp Not sure if you got a real world distraction, but I just quickly tossed those images you uploaded into Bike Bridges. Users/JabberWokky

20070926 20:14:51 nbsp Fantastic writing on the Bridges. That was a fun read. Users/JabberWokky

20070926 21:41:19 nbsp Awesome contributions! BTW, I remember your brother from DHS and (I think) Holmes... Users/Graham.Freeman

20070928 23:47:31 nbsp nice pics on the Critical Mass page. and i like th epics on this user page. since you like to solve math problems, can u prove that .999 repeating  1? Users/JessicaRockwell

20070928 23:57:44 nbsp but theres a mathematical proof. shall i tell you or have you work it out? Users/JessicaRockwell

20070930 15:45:04 nbsp I love your polaroid mystery pictures! Users/PhilipNeustrom

20071001 01:01:50 nbsp thanks for posting the pics of mass. Users/PxlAted

20071007 17:18:25 nbsp good mystery picture, Ive got a photo of it as well. Users/JasonAller

20071023 23:52:41 nbsp Im not gonna let some n00b get away with sanitizing an entry. I have little tolerance for this crap in general, actually. I figure if I keep their stuff from being up too long and act quickly, theyll find that it isnt worth their time to trash the wiki and move on. Provides a disincentive to repeat the behavior in the future. Seems to work, with the notable exception of Steve Ostrowski who never got the cluestick. Users/WilliamLewis

20071025 00:15:59 nbsp Hey, Thanks. I did want a better representation of the unit. It was my overall goal. Honestly I am new on here... I mean really its a public posting site, not a video game or anything. I really didnt want that senseless editing war, but if someone really has the time/energy to waste on trying so badly to get rid of newcomer edits I just felt like playing along with it since I was bored at home anyways. haha.

Anyways, im happy somebody understands the idea of treating newcomers well. ) Users/ThUn

20080103 12:31:23 nbsp Nice Featured Page! Users/JabberWokky

20080329 14:55:57 nbsp Hi Jeff! I just came across a comment you left re Zocolos in Sac. Finally, someone who agrees that its nothing more than a noisy meat market. I met up with some friends there and that is exactly what I thought. When I shared this with them they got all, How DARE you!! Users/CurlyGirl26

20080330 14:06:36 nbsp Last time I was at Zocolos, I was just angry. To avoid the blowhardy Zocolos crowd, I now go to Tres Hermanas or Ernestos. Both have good Mexi food; less douchebags.

Diet Coke, I know: Lame. I got addicted to it while in college trying to avoid the Freshmen 50 or whatever. I know its totally gross, but. . .I love it! Its weird that I even drink it because I dont have to worry about calories or watching my weight and all I eat is crap, anyway. Im trying to quit, though. Users/CurlyGirl26

20080819 19:58:13 nbsp Good guess, Jeff! I never would have known that the photo was taken at Crepeville had I not been there. Users/CurlyGirl26

20081010 07:05:44 nbsp Ok, so google maps approximates the distance from Covell to the dead end at about .17 km. Lets say youre riding on a 26x1.5 tire (around 40559), which should have a circumference of around 201cm (we could do the rollout test for better accuracy here). That gives us 84.6 tire revolutions to reach the wall. In the unreasonable 52/11, thats almost 18 pedal revolutions. A more reasonable gear of 42/20 gives 40 pedals. You said 45 which is pretty close. A gear of 42/23 (a bit low maybe, but way more reasonable than 52/11) gives 46 pedals. Id say you nailed it.

Additional bonus points for revealing the little Montessori school without a wiki page behind the wall at the end of the Green Meadows greenbelt! That has to be a high score or something. Users/EdHenn

20081016 05:05:37 nbsp So you grew up in Davis? Im wondering if youre related to a Gina I went to school with. Users/EdHenn

20081016 22:57:49 nbsp Dont think Ive seen her since dhs... say hi for me! Users/EdHenn

20081225 11:23:17 nbsp Merry Xmas everybody! Users/jefftolentino

20090512 19:11:55 nbsp I like the kiss. Thats a nice one. Users/JabberWokky

20090513 22:32:24 nbsp hi Jeff! nice photos on your page. its true, i am a traitor. Users/IrinaChakraborty

20100316 00:04:19 nbsp Okay... let me just open the envelope... Aaaaand... the award for best new entry so far in 2010 goes to... Jeff Tolentino! For his work, Inanimate Objects with Amusing Faces! Users/JabberWokky

20100328 10:10:05 nbsp Thanks! Users/WesHardaker

20100402 23:53:34 nbsp Thank you! Users/IDoNotExist

20100511 07:01:51 nbsp Hey, how is my suggestion not do nothing, other than tools? It is intended to be such, and if its being misinterpreted, Id like to fix that. Zero changes on the content and people side, only adding more ways to make the record of changes more open and easy to read. Right now there are a limited set of people who know how and have time to track down the information that is available scattered across several pages. Users/JabberWokky

20100511 07:03:58 nbsp Ennui is a great entry! Users/JabberWokky

20100511 08:13:28 nbsp 6 is do nothing but one specific change. 7 is do nothing to peoples rights to edit the wiki (including making sure everybody appears the same when editing), and allows for unspecified informational changes (the ones I list are tools I have and Jason had, so its flattening the inequity there), but draws a clear line: all editors from first uncertain edit to burnt out gnome will remain equal when it comes to the actual content. No flagging within content, no rights given or taken due to any automated metric. What Bob can do, Connie can do. 8 is do nothing, including not opening up records so that they are easier to read (which creates inequity in what people can be aware of). 7 is an effort to share opportunity more evenly and explicitly draw a line to protect equal rights to content. Users/JabberWokky

20100511 08:42:44 nbsp Well, there are going to be a bunch of changes, so do nothing is really keep the interface as similar as possible to what we have now. Users/JabberWokky

20100616 14:09:22 nbsp http://vimeo.com/12555175 is the video. The time lapse section might be cut out and added to the wiki. Users/JasonAller
 Yeah, you can see it at its home on http://localwiki.org/ Daubert
  That IS awesome! Users/jefftolentino

20100708 11:57:04 nbsp haha thx, ive been going thru pages with the spellchecker on firefox and just correcting what catches my eye. Users/JoePomidor

20100720 08:25:32 nbsp Explore is huge and very little should be added to it... and that was a great addition, in my opinion! Users/JabberWokky

20100730 10:08:59 nbsp Hi Jeff, Send me an email re: City Commissions and lets see if we can find a time to talk. kemblepope at gmail dot com Users/KemblePope

20100810 21:29:00 nbsp A noble effort with XYZ. I hope it gets through. Users/TomGarberson

20100831 19:40:53 nbsp Thats awesome, thank you so much, Jeff! Users/TomGarberson

20110411 21:55:49 nbsp Hi Jeff, thoroughly enjoyed the Random Camera @ the MU! Thanks! Users/ForestNeelGrant

20110518 12:22:47 nbsp Anybody who creates a Talk page off a Talk page is a dork. Wait...
 Users/JabberWokky

20110518 12:22:58 nbsp Jeff, Jeff, Jeff. Its spelled Monticello. Come on now! Users/TomGarberson

20110525 15:25:32 nbsp Yeah. Not cool. Users/TomGarberson

20110827 19:20:49 nbsp As stupid as it may sound, I think the core wiki greatness is in the kind of stuff just created about the carpet cleaning. Users/JabberWokky
  Doesnt sound stupid to me at all. I agree completely. cp

20110914 02:39:16 nbsp The LoshJawson account is not JoshLawson and has nothing to do with Josh himself. Its a parody account that somebody else is using. On the other point, a few people have emailed or IMed me about banning William this evening, and at least one person hinted at it on the wiki. I think youre the first, however, to mention it openly on the wiki. Most seem to feel hes crossed some kind of line in their mind, but that a ban proposal probably wont go anywhere. I dont know what that means, but I figured youd at least like to know youre not alone in being concerned about the treatment of new editors. I even got an Ive been doing this for x years, and am an expert in internet blah blah, and you should ban WilliamLewis email out of the blue. (It was polite, Im not trying to mock the email or its intent). I get the idea sometimes that theres a silent audience that watches the active editors: Ive sometimes gotten calls from people (usually business owners) who know all kinds of odd details about wiki culture but Ive never seen edit or speak up. Users/JabberWokky

20110919 01:22:41 nbsp new owner so you never know! Users/StevenDaubert

20110923 11:50:20 nbsp while I understand the need to inject your flair into that article, the city has its own term which Scott used correctly. Thanks Users/StevenDaubert

20110923 14:06:43 nbsp its my fault for giving him the image that has Davis statistics on it, they delineate between Sewer and Water manholes Users/StevenDaubert

20110930 09:55:25 nbsp Jeff, the discussion has been dead for two weeks. Unless you have something else to add, the discussion should be deleted. Users/WilliamLewis

20110930 11:05:31 nbsp Again, you are restoring a dead proposal. Unless you want to continue discussing why I need to be banned, the proposal should be closed. Users/WilliamLewis

20111001 16:14:51 nbsp Me, too. (Of course Id say that!) Really, discussion over content is disheartening enough. Policy is worse (the ban page would fit in there). Metapolicy (how should we deal with the pages dealing with proposed policy) is even worse. The antidote for me? Go out and take some pictures. The wiki always needs more. One more reason I need to move back to Davis... Users/WilliamLewis

20111121 17:39:51 nbsp That Katehi is more dangerous to the campus community than her alleged health and safety issues is not an opinion. Its a fact. There would have been no hospitalized students if she had not sent in the police. Some people feel are weaselwords that should not be applied to facts.  Users/WilliamLewis

20111121 17:40:57 nbsp I agree with WL on this one. Users/CovertProfessor

20111121 17:48:34 nbsp Not trying to downplay her actions here, but I think it serves the movement better to be objective in our editing here.  Trying to be an adult.    Users/jefftolentino
 I contend I am being objective here. Just because something is bitingly critical doesnt mean it isnt true and unbiased.  As for what serves the movement better or not, I could not care less. I despise the occupy movement. Capitalism is great, class warfare is Marxist bullshit, and income inequality is not a problem.... a low standard of living across society is. And those are subjective opinions. What isnt is that the universitys response has been inept, harmful to students, and has only added fuel to the fire they were trying to extinguish. That should be expressed as clearly as possible to the world.Users/WilliamLewis

20111121 17:57:07 nbsp I believe adults often express strong opinions, especially ones that they can back up with sound reasons, as WL did. Users/CovertProfessor

20111121 18:08:27 nbsp Actually, I agree with Williams message here.  Just trying to remove some of the more absolute language.  I think it makes the statement stronger. Users/jefftolentino

20111121 18:13:21 nbsp We miss you. Dont you think its about time to officially rejoin the Davis Wiki community? Forgive us, please. Its the adult thing to do. ;) Users/ScottMeehleib

20111121 18:14:49 nbsp Ive missed you too. Ive been working on the treatment plant articles. I will upload eventually. Users/jefftolentino
 As in waste water treatment? This sounds strangely fascinating. <3  Users/WilliamLewis
  Probably not so much, but it should improve whats there currently.  I really have missed this place.  Users/jefftolentino

20111121 21:15:45 nbsp 90% of my editing is done on an iPhone. Sucks indeed.  Users/ScottMeehleib

20111206 10:42:49 nbsp That seems to get into the whole NPOV issue... besides which, Jeff Wood doesnt seem to disagree with the use of casually.  I guess Im opposed to deleting a description just because someone doesnt like it.  If its actually inaccurate, sure.  If theres a difference of opinion, both opinions can be represented on the page.  If its just that someone doesnt like it... well, Id say tough patooties. Users/TomGarberson

20111206 14:12:59 nbsp I honestly want to know how http://daviswiki.org/November_18%2C_2011_UC_Davis_Police_Response_to_Occupy_UC_Davis?actiondiff&version2610&version1609 this edit is offensive and me making it was in any way uncivil.  Users/WilliamLewis
  It pains me that youre a board member, William.  Grow up.  JT
   In response to this comment not taking my query seriously and insulting me instead, I http://daviswiki.org/Users/jefftolentino?actiondiff&version2144&version1143 deleted this thread with the edit comment, I wanted an answer, not an insult. sigh. Jeff http://daviswiki.org/Users/jefftolentino?actiondiff&version2145&version1144 restored the thread with the edit comment If you want to seriously discuss, say so. Dont delete. We all have opinions :) If you insist on having this discussion, please answer my original question and drop the insults. How was http://daviswiki.org/November_18%2C_2011_UC_Davis_Police_Response_to_Occupy_UC_Davis?actiondiff&version2610&version1609 this edit offensive? How was making it in any way uncivil?  Users/WilliamLewis

    Dont know what to tell you William.  Publically accusing a police officer of throwing gasoline on innocent protesters is pretty inflammatory (no pun intended).  This may be YOUR opinion, but to me its immature and unbecoming of someone who represents and makes organizational decisions for Daviswiki.  That is my opinion, William, but you are free to restore your edit to the protest page if you feel it is the right one to make.  JT
     I will gently and respectfully suggest to you that you misread it.  Tom and I were wondering why you were so upset.  It does not say at all what you read it to mean.  jw
     For what its worth, I took the throws gasoline onto the Occupy UC Davis movement phrase as nonliteral, as in throwing gasoline on the fire.  If viewed in that light (also no pun intended), Id also say its a fairly accurate statement, in that it brought bajillions of people out and turned Occupy UCD into a major international news story.  If interpreted literally, it seems more just... weird... than uncivil. Users/TomGarberson
       As an idiomatic phrase, it is pretty common.  Even more common is the related adding fuel to the fire.  Both simply mean to inflame and increase an already dramatic situation, which is what the pepper spraying did. jw
     So you honestly thought I was talking about literal gasoline and not the cliché http://www.clichesite.com/content.asp?whichtip+2987 throwing gasoline on the fire? I thought that was a commonly understood phrase. The pepper spray has caused the tents to grow in number, three police officers to be suspended, spawned five investigations, and brought http://publiclaboratory.org/notes/micheletobias/11212011/occupyucdavisnov212011 thousands to the quad. The loss of respect the department has suffered is profound. Most importantly, the administration is politically unable to use any police force to clear the quad, their original objective.
    As for the Wiki Spot board, I dont speak for the board on here unless otherwise stated. Users/WilliamLewis
       Wow, well that was definitely a poor edit then, especially in light of the recent discussion.  Ambiguous and way too easy to take literally.  The dude is squirting liquid all over people!  It should have at least been thought through a little more.  JT
       I got it. Did anybody else take it literally besides Jeff? M
         I dont think anyone could plausibly be misled.  The very next words on the page are UCD Police Pepper Spray Seated Protesters as the first line in the TOC, which is repeated again in huge lettering down in the first header.  The phrase pepper spray (or spraying, or sprayed, etc.) is repeated 10 more times in that first section of the narrative.  Nowhere is it claimed that gasoline was used on protesters.  At worst, the caption claimed that an officer sprayed a movement with gasoline.  And in that case, its nonsensical, but theres hardly a risk of misleading anyone about what happened. TG
          I think it was clear, but I think there might be a better place to note that the pepper spraying poured gasoline on the Occupy UC Davis movement  and the Occupy movement more generally, I think.   Users/CovertProfessor
           I dont know what to tell you guys.  I know that gasoline was not really thrown on anyone, but there was a lot of loose language tossed around this morning, (I remember a couple jokes about pepperspraying each other over bad edits for instance).  To me it came off as an inappropriate joke edit in the midst of a serious discussion about subjective language on the protest page.  The timing and language could have been thought out a little better.  Ill concede however, if read in the way William has explained it, it is not offensive.  Still its sometimes hard to tell when people are being facetious or not.  There was a lot of pointed and snippy language today, and nobody is going to interpret every edit the same way.  Ive definitely said things which have been called offensive, which I thought were fine.  In any event; William, Im sorry I misunderstood your edit.  The way you intended it was not offensive, I just didnt understand it correctly.

20111207 15:51:44 nbsp Well said.  Thank you.   Users/JabberWokky

20111207 17:03:36 nbsp Just a heads up to everybody.  Im stepping back again now.  I made my statements and I want to let it go for a while myself.  If it not the end of it, so be it.  I can give it another try later.  Thanks, JW, for the nod.  In light of my own bad edits, I want to fix things up again. Users/jefftolentino

20111207 18:07:26 nbsp I didnt see your post until after mine. Dont worry I am going to pull back for now and just let the mmen handle it at meggos suggestion Users/OliviaY

20111208 20:23:21 nbsp My question was whether he meant to delete his comment or not. I believe that is separate from trying to start the conversation up again. Users/MeggoWaffle

20111209 11:14:45 nbsp Yes, I think he should restore it if he didnt mean to delete it. Now, dont take this next part personally. I understand you think you are trying to keep the peace, but honestly, and maybe you dont realize this, it appears as though you are trying to assert authority. Both of your messages have been the equivalent of well you have every RIGHT to wear that dress, but it makes you look really fat. Maybe he agreed with your post and thats why he deleted it, or maybe he just accidentally did so after the edit conflict. I think hes capable of making the decision on whether to restore his comment without you hinting about how much damage it would do. Users/MeggoWaffle

20111209 18:34:19 nbsp Eh?  How did you get to sacwiki during the downtime?  They are on the same server... Users/JabberWokky

20111209 19:01:02 nbsp Ah! Users/JabberWokky

20111211 20:08:33 nbsp Hey jeff the sac test url wasnt supposed to be really passed around yet.  The edits made to the site, until the import is finalized, are thrown out every time I do a reimport.  But dont worry  I saved that crazy map trace you did of the Sac region on my computer :) Users/PhilipNeustrom

20111212 08:37:06 nbsp Hey, Jeff  the test version was just replaced with a new test version. He emailed me:
The only known problem with this import is the All Pages tab crashes right now.  Aside from that everything should be good.  The user information, includes and redirects should all be working now.  Take a good look around and let me know if you spot any problems with the import!

(and just to reiterate, dont put anything even sort of important on the test site.  Ill blow away the import when I do another import. All important stuff should still go on http://sacwiki.org/ up until the point we do the final import and switchover) Users/NicholasBarry
  Take a look at the notice I put up on the front page of the https://sacramento.localwiki.org test site.

20111212 11:35:37 nbsp Cool. You should comment on the Wiki Gatherings page about your interest! Users/NicholasBarry

20111212 14:08:03 nbsp Hey, FYI, you can indent bullets in Localwiki. You just have to use the Indent button in the toolbar. Users/NicholasBarry
  I also think it would be cool to be able to indent using the TAB key. Ive added that to the feature requests already  probably not everyone will think to look for the indent button.
   Thank you!  Lovin the new format, but yeah still trying to figure out some of the details.  Definitely better than the old markup schemes though.  Users/jefftolentino

20111217 16:27:29 nbsp Sure thing. I hope I didnt hurt your feelings  I know you mean well. Users/MeggoWaffle

20111221 10:19:55 nbsp Jeff, thanks for all the great map edits on the new Sacwiki! (Isnt the map fun to play with?) Users/NicholasBarry
  Definitely! The mapping alone makes the whole localwiki upgrade worthwhile! JT

20111224 17:33:20 nbsp I dont mind addressing the issue of opening up the wiki to underrepresented groups, but Im thinking that that particular entry is somewhat poisoned with antagonistic stances.  Im not being down on the participants, but I think the mood or tone in that particular space isnt ideal for a productive discussion about issues.  Gender issues is one reason I support pseudonyms, preferably ones somebody can relate to.  My personal concern is the lack of older Davisites (above 60), as they are drastically underrepresented.  Im sure there are several other groups as well as those two.  I did try to work with a couple of the homeless to get their views.  I used to talk to George Swazo now and then about the wiki and Davis. Users/JabberWokky

20111226 04:31:55 nbsp my words exactly, but I was slightly more vitriolic so I backed off Users/StevenDaubert

20111226 06:49:22 nbsp I figured Id help him prove his point.  Amusingly, I would really like some good, solid antiOccupy viewpoints represented on the wiki.  Whatever that was, was not that. Users/JabberWokky

20111226 19:29:59 nbsp And now well see just how well the wikis messaging system works, if at all... Users/CovertProfessor

20111226 19:39:35 nbsp Oh, I was upset with some of the recent conversation about (not at you).  I couldnt believe some people were saying the things that they were saying.  I suppose I should put it back.

But then again, I could ask you when your page is coming back.  It was always such a nice page.

20111226 22:50:30 nbsp Thanks for your kind comments about my page.  Im behind on some of my restaurant reviews, but hopefully I will get to them soon.  As for the Sac Wiki, I see the appeal, but I wouldnt be much help since I dont actually know all that much about the city.  I just wanted to create a page for the ice cream place Id heard about, but when I tried to edit the table I was getting a link that I couldnt delete, and had no way of telling if it was linking the way it should or not (it was for the address, so perhaps this relates to the cool mapping feature you mention).  Of course, I could have RTFM, but Ive never been very good about doing that. With the Davis Wiki, I could just click Edit and see how it was done.  Its pretty rare that I actually had to consult a help page.  And there is nothing worse than fighting wysiwyg, trying to figure out how to get it to do what you want it to do, when a clear and unambiguous code will specify exactly what should be done.

20120104 20:14:48 nbsp No Jeff, theyre not the same group.  The Quakers, the Friends and The American Friends Service Committee  theyre closely related.  These Friends are pacifists and it wouldnt be surprising to find some of them participating in the peaceful Friends of the West Pond activities.  Theres an idea on the Davis Wiki that things can be linked so the surfer, so to speak, will go all over the place.  I dont know if theres an appropriate place on the page for the Friends from the Davis Friends Meeting since the surfer is probably expecting that Friends are for the West Pond.  Perhaps there could be a comment to distinguish a link to the Quaker Friends. Users/BruceHansen

20120104 21:52:55 nbsp  I agree with your observation that the crosslink lacked relation and was difficult to understand.  Bruce is big on word play  they both have the word friend in the title.   I think the page content makes it pretty clear that one group is focused on a pond. Users/EdWins

20120104 22:32:56 nbsp Im OK with whimsical linking, but this one was potentially confusing (from one group to another, perhaps falsely implying that the groups were connected) and so I deleted the link.  I think the whimsical links work well only if its obvious that they are just for fun. Users/CovertProfessor
   I love whimsical links, but yeah  the idea is to promote discovery, not imply incorrect assertions.  I have, while editing, made links and changed or undone them specifically because I was worried they implied something unintended. jw

20120106 16:37:02 nbsp Hey, interested in getting together for a Davis edit party to play around with the new Sacwiki code? Not that its anything new for you, since youve been working with it for a while now, but it could be fun to get together with some other editors.

20120223 21:06:09 nbsp Id personally like more deleting and reworking of comments into cohesive prose that respects and collects the combined views, but thats just me. The bit that boggled me in his comment wasnt about deleting  it was (paraphrasing) I am going to tag all your uses of the word delete anywhere on the wiki with a disclaimer that it does not match my personal meaning of the word.

And on a side topic, I supported the Ban William page because its important for people to voice problems and point back to them when they reoccur.  So watch it with blanket you guys statements...  I may just have to start posting disclaimers on all your edits.  Big pink ones.  With bold and all caps.  And blinking.  Fuzzy, if I can manage that somehow. Users/JabberWokky
 Sorry, sir, not you. JT
  I wouldnt mind more reworking of comments, too.  And so, in my original query to EW, I asked if he was going to do this.  At first he seemed to suggest that he didnt feel comfortable doing that and the moving comments was only temporary.  But then later he admitted that he thought the other comments were irrelevant and so he XdeletedX Edgared them.  As for the deletion of the BW page, one thing that you can say is that it was supported by a community process, however imperfect those are.  Id also point out that there were important differences between that case and this one, but I doubt that you really want to start that whole discussion again (do you?)   Users/CovertProfessor

20120224 07:49:52 nbsp Ok, I wont rehash then, either. Ill just say that Im glad you came back to edit the wiki, as imperfect as the collaboration can be sometimes. Users/CovertProfessor

20120224 08:20:24 nbsp I hope you dont mind my saying so, but it seems clear youre not entirely cool with it.  It seems like youre still bitter or upset about it, given that you make some digs about it pretty regularly.  I keep my mouth shut because I dont want it to blow up again, but its frankly a bit frustrating to feel like Im being demonized for it, along with some other editors, every time a new controversy comes up.

20120224 09:52:11 nbsp By not naming names you mean youre just being passive aggressive about it.  Well, theres nothing I can do to stop you.

But if youre trolling and just want to provoke a reaction, keep up the good work.  Each time you do it its a little more frustrating than the last, feeling like Im being insulted without responding (obviously, since I am responding). Users/TomGarberson

20120224 10:44:14 nbsp Youre wrong about why the Ban William Lewis page was deleted.  In your mind, obviously I, CP, and others were motivated by censoring your opinion about William.  If that were in fact the case, yes, it would be hypocritical to object to EWs removal of others opinions from the page.  But its not the case.  It was a failed ban proposal.  It was deleted because it was a failed ban proposal. Users/TomGarberson

20120224 11:41:14 nbsp http://daviswiki.org/ban_josh_lawson?actioninfo Ban Josh Lawson.  Deleted 6 months before the Ban William Lewis proposal, after it became clear the proposal had failed.  There was some important stuff on that page about people using the wiki to try to harm others, but the ban proposal (the topic of the page) failed.  JW proposed deletion and I deleted it, because it needed to be cleaned up.  If we need to revisit the issue, itll take about 30 seconds to restore the page.  Just like Williams ban page.

Youre ascribing sinister motives to something that wasnt sinister.  You obviously think Im lying when I tell you what my motive was.  Thats why I find it insulting.  If you want to go on being an ass about it, like I said, theres nothing I can do to stop you.  But I want to make sure youre aware that you are being an ass about it.

If theres a conversation that needs to be had about board members, tone, or dealing with new users, lets have that conversation.  But thats a different matter and a different page. Users/TomGarberson

20120224 13:24:25 nbsp Come on, man.  Dont play that game.  Youve been calling everyone who disagreed with you on the BW page hypocrites and, implicitly, liars for months.  If youre offended by the word ass Ill remove it.  My point was that you need to look at what youre doing.

Im tired of the passive aggressive shenanigans.  If you think theres an important issue, lets deal with the important issue and clear the air.  You obviously have a great deal of animosity towards your fellow editors here, and its poisoning virtually every conversation you enter.

20120224 16:04:39 nbsp My contribution to the BWL event was mainly to express why I thought that WL should not be banned (at the time, you said you liked my comment) and then to vote that the page should be deleted once it seemed as though the ban proposal had failed.  I note that you were the one to finally delete the page, so I find it a bit puzzling that you are still harboring resentment after all of this time.  I also think that rules can have exceptions.  Dont you?  For example, I think comments calling someone a derogatory name should be deleted, and I have consistently supported that exception to the rule.  I thought that the BWL page was another exception.  You disagreed.  We could continue to talk about whether it ought to have been an exception or not, but saying that rules have exceptions (especially when the rules are constantly evolving in light of community discussion) is not inconsistent. Users/CovertProfessor

20120224 16:47:39 nbsp Better to say that, then, than to rehash old wounds and accuse people of being inconsistent.  I almost noted the exceptions myself in my original comment to him, but at some point my parentheticals get out of hand, i.e., I was just trying to keep things simple.  I cant think of any analogous case where the wiki went along with deleting comments off of a page simply because someone else found them to be unimportant and irrelevant.

Just watched that episode.  Seemed relevant. Users/TomGarberson

20120315 20:51:00 nbsp You didnt make any point at all but thank you for deleting the page. Lets move on... Users/PeterBoulay

20120315 20:59:46 nbsp Correct me if I am wrong, but I dont think youve edited the wiki since you proposed banning WL the last time.  I dont think its right for you to complain about the way other editors handle things if youre not even going to attempt to help yourself.  Its very easy to sit on the sidelines and criticize, but a lot harder to actually get your hands dirty and try to deal with a situation as best as you see fit.  Youre saying we should try backoff editing, which can be a good solution in many cases, but when all you do is backoff and never edit, youre not really contributing at all, right?  I guess what I am saying is that I would like to see you help out when there is a problem, not just criticize about the ways that others have done so.

In this case, I think the reverts were warranted.  This isnt just a problem that came up today, but one that has been cropping up for months, so backoff editing wouldnt help, but would just delay the problem.  I made one revert myself as a way of backing up TG, to let sritern know that TG was not being a dictator and that sriterns actions on the wiki over these many months were not acceptable to many editors.  I still think that was the right thing to do and not a useless action.

 Users/CovertProfessor

20120315 22:07:51 nbsp Was bringing up the WL ban again constructive?  Was criticizing other editors constructive?  It doesnt seem so to me.  Constructive might have been to try talking with sritern yourself.  I think then you might be in a better position to judge whether things were mishandled.  Seriously, things look different when youre actually trying to work things out and youve not made any progress.  I cant commit to changing my awful ways (my one revert??) because again, I think that was the right thing to do at the right time, for the reason I stated above. Users/CovertProfessor

20120315 22:14:46 nbsp Jeff, is there something we can do that would help you get over your animosity?  You say you want to see constructive editing from other users, but what youre doing is the exact opposite. Youre trying to tear down the people youre pissed off at.  Youre trying over and over and over again.  Youre semicovering it up with the passiveaggressiveness, but believe me, its not fooling anyone.

If youre not willing to work this out, just stop.  Seriously.  Stop.  Youve done more to damage the tone and atmosphere of the wiki than any single other editor in the past 6 months or so, and youre still doing it.  Unless you can set aside your animosity, by far the most constructive way you can contribute to the wiki is to stop editing.  That would be a shame, because you used to be a good editor.  But youve been shitting all over the wiki for months and it really, truly needs to stop. Users/TomGarberson

  Tom, I kind of think youre being a bit unfair.  Im trying to address a few things that I think were problems today.  There was no good that came out of reverting 15 times in a row, honestly.  It was childish on both sides.  I do think that WL can be an overly harsh editor, and yeah I honestly believe that aspect of his editing deteriorates DW.  I thought I was very patient about it though, seriously waiting a number of years before ever deciding to say anything about it (and to be fair the last time this came up, I did concede that things seemed to have improved).  On top of that, any discussion of it has largely been removed from DW.  Ill agree, seeing it go really rubbed me the wrong way, especially after I thought Id been pretty fair about it.  Regardless, I simply wanted to point out tonight that Im seeing the pattern of bad editing continue again.  Im not being passive aggressive about it.  In fact, Ive been very open tonight that, in my opinion, the edit war this afternoon was a lot of poor editing, from all sides.  If thats destructive to say, Im sorry.  I feel like it needed to be noted though.  Also, I think the backoff editing approach is a positive one and noted that as well.  Ive forgotten it myself, but its a good one.  Ill honor it now, in fact.  You can get the last word in tonight if you like.  Before I go though, Im sorry about your job.  That really sucks.  Even with all the back and forth between you and I, I really hope you find something again soon.  Im saying that sincerely, sir.  Best of luck.  JT
  Thanks, Jeff.  I appreciate the sentiment.  But dont you see what youre doing here, over and over and over again?  You go on the attack, then when you get called on it, you seem to get hurt and offended.  You conclude the episode with magnanimous gestures and a friendly signoff.  Ordinarily, Id say that all is well, the issue is resolved.  But you just keep doing it over and over again.  Attack, withdrawal, magnanimity.  Go quiet for a few weeks.  Attack, withdraw, magnanimity.  And every time, you sign off in a way where you explicitly try to be the bigger man, and make anyone whos frustrated with this pattern look bad.  I honestly have no idea whether you truly dont realize what youre doing and are stuck in this nasty cycle or whether youre playing some kind of game.  Either way, as I expressed last night and the previous time we had this conversation, youre doing more to damage the wiki than any other editor has in recent months.  It needs to stop.  If theres something I can do to help you with your anger, lets figure out what that is.  If theres something others can do, lets talk to them.  But this isnt sustainable.  It needs to stop. TG

20120403 17:51:18 nbsp Jeff, Brent was attempting to be funny (I think) whereas I was not. Your hilarious comment makes no sense. I dont believe anyone here wishes to engage with your negativity, so please either contribute to the wiki or go back to lurking. Users/MeggoWaffle
  Im not going to post a LMGTFY link as you did with BL, MW, but if you still dont see what I thought was hilarious, its that I thought your statement about BL had an element of hypocrisy to it, thats all.  Maybe you dont think that was funny, but I still found it pretty amusing.  And regarding negativity, when did calling somebody out on a potentially racial or sexist comment become a bad thing?  JT
  My question exactly. When did pointing out someones exercise of white privilege become a bad thing? Oh right, apparently thats reverse racism. Anyway, you arent worth my time. Have a nice day. M
    Well, thanks for brushing off legitimate concerns then, I guess.  Have a nice day too.  JT
    Nope, I just dont have time to teach Privilege 101 to people who dont want to hear about it. For those who are interested, they can follow my link on Brents user page. M
      I dont really appreciate your assumption there, MW. You have no idea of who I am or what my experiences with privilege are. My family has faced is own set of prejudices with regard to interracial marriage and skin color. Ive been profiled dozens of times, by all types of people, from complete strangers, to teachers, to police officers. Nor, has my life been a free pass. I worked for many years at minimum wage jobs, riding the bus to work, because I didnt have a car. I spent 5 years in community college, so I could save money and work while in school. Three of those years I worked at two of the Los Rios CC learning centers, helping ESL students with English, (a free service to all students, and another minimum wage job for me). I did eventually transfer and finished an engineering program here in Davis, but I paid for it myself, (actually, Im still paying for it). My parents didnt give me any money, and I didnt get any scholarships because I was halfwhite or male. Rather, I worked extremely hard and went into fairly substantial debt to get here. Honestly, I resent the fact that youd assume I need a lecture from you on privilege, but what bothers me even more, is that youre doing so by making full on generalizations about other people based on race and gender, and casting about your sarcasm with your Let Me Google That For You link.  In my opinion, youre out of line here.  Please stop posting to my page. JT
      I appreciate your experiences with oppression, but Ill reiterate that we are all privileged in various ways and most of these ways are invisible  just because you have been discriminated against doesnt mean you dont experience privilege, just as I receive certain unearned benefits based on other aspects of my identity despite being a woman living in a patriarchal society. And youre right, its not my job to educate you. Thus the LMGTFY link, which was for Brent, who actually asked for an explanation of the phrase. Nobody asked you to click it, did they? Not once did I lecture at you I simply defended myself against your accusations. And in case you havent noticed, I have tried to stop posting on your page several times now and you continually try to goad me back into responding by asking questions and then implying that I am brushing you off when I try to disengage. So, go ahead, get your last dig in. Youll get your wish but it was my wish first. Peace. Megan

20120406 09:57:42 nbsp I didnt want to get involved with this wiki fray, but from an outside perspective (note I havent edited on it at all on the topic matter).  I dont think MWs comment came across tactful (I personally had never heard of check your privileged til I saw the google link), I can see the bigger picture concern.   If there were a group called  Enslave the Regents protesting and trying to rein in the Regents of the UC, some people might take issue with the name.  I guess what I saw was (from a zoomed out view).
Person1:  The name is messed up, shouldnt invoke slavery.
Person2: Chill out, who cares its just a word.
Person1: Dude, check out history.
Person2: (joke about wiki page history)
Person1: Not funny, coming from a guy whose race hasnt been enslaved.
Person2: Dont bring my race into this.  <delete convo thread>

Ive been reading the back and forth between BL and CP, among others.

Personally, I think BL was a bit overly glib at first.  I didnt know what check your privilege meant either, so I can understand that.  And I think MW was offended a bit quick, but the issue clearly hits closer to her home than mine, so I can understand that.

I dont actually see it as a racist attack, in the sense of the zoomed out view. Honestly, I lean more towards CPs rational point on BLs page about the issue. However, CP wasnt involved in the original thread.  I think both BL and MW are at fault, and not for their standpoints but at their failure in communication. And hey, as others have noted, the wiki tends to be a poor communication medium for debate.

Overall, I am saddened by the back and forth, but I dont want to quibble over who was at fault or initiated it.  It doesnt really matter.   Users/EdWins

  Yeah, really I think this got a bit over discussed.  The original string was a lot of attacking on both sides, and I really didnt like that meggos comment about being white and male was reverted after its first deletion.  I didnt really think it did much good on the page.  I was happy to see it go the second time and I thought there was a pretty good effort to rewrite it fairly.  The check your privileges term was also new to me, btw.  The talk page did let MW additional address some issues that she wanted resolved, but I know the continued discussion was wearing on people too.  I wish it could have been nicer, but yeah, it is what it is.  As far as the accusations about MW being a racist go, I just left a comment with CP about my thoughts on that.  I dont really feel comfortable calling her a racist.  I do think she stereotyped BL and I do feel like she was making generalizations about him, but the racist label, to me was extreme, and I made an effort to avoid that.  JT
   Umm, no you didnt  see my reply to you on my page.  Feel free to retract your previous statements at any point.  cp
    Youre really nit picking here, CP.  Fine, I supported BL, who was pretty mad about being stereotyped.  He did say she made a racist statement. Cool.  I still dont feel comfortable with the term myself, but I understand BL being upset, and I understand BL seeing some validity in the use of the word racist.  JT
     Not at all.  See reply on my page.  cp

20120406 10:03:39 nbsp I guess the word occupy has less known, or maybe less publicized, connotations than slavery or enslavement.  News has been full of uproar over the last few months over usage of that.  http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/03/20/georgiaparentsupsetovernewcasemathhomeworkreferencingslavery/ in homework, for example.  contained an extracredit question that read, A plantation owner had 100 slaves. If threefifths of them are counted for representation, how many slaves will be counted?  I suppose my summarized conversation above can be repeated for this one, just swap a few words around.  If someone were to comment people need to chill and its just a word in a math problem, other people might be upset.  Especially of those from different backgrounds, and I dont see (in such a context) a person as being racist for pointing that out.
However, I stand by my comment of 30 seconds ago, I think both people could have, and should have, communicated better.  Users/EdWins
   That pretty much sums it up in my view.  I think a major contributing factor is that they were also communicating with terms that had very different meanings to each of them and from very different mindsets and philosophical views that caused things to become inflamed very quickly.  jw

20120605 11:41:44 nbsp Hi Jeff. I dont have time right now to look into the history, but why is a page about the J Street Coop, a single building on a single lot, called Coops (plural) after Angels request? If the page was a metapage about the houses across the street  that is, a different page than it has been for years  the idea would make sense. But this remains a page about 234 J Street. Please enlighten me, or (weeks from now) Ill have the time to undo your renaming. (And thanks in advance for a response.) Users/DougWalter
  Thank you again. Now that I know, Ill keep the page, strip the content and post it to J Street Coop and (using my semiaccurate and historical knowledge of the corner) make a new page that talks about the two housing coops in three buildings at J and Third. Do not hold your breath waiting; unfortunately, there are a few thing in the way of my editing. Users/DougWalter

20120606 14:53:51 nbsp Quite frankly, Im really upset at this assumption it has ever or will ever be treated causally, as I agonize over the ethics involved in each decision, and always aim for the maximally open presentation while trying to retain individual privacy for things like mental health issues or Social Security information.  It is a very rarely used tool, and is always disclosed to the community when used.

It is not a joking matter to me.  It is profoundly serious issue of community and ethics. Users/JabberWokky
  Sorry, I seriously thought you were kidding. JT
    No worries.  I want to make it clear its a serious issue, and it has not been used flippantly (other than one time by mistake, and I fessed up immediately).  I would need strong consensus from a wide spectrum of the current active community before Id feel comfortable doing any sort of routine memoryholing.  Succinctly, it removes accountability, and is thus really quite dangerous.  Its also the right tool for the job, occasionally.  To be fair, there are ways around it, in terms of watching the changelog news feed and such.  If it were ever being abused, I think it would be caught by the more observant/analretentive folks.  Ive gotten IMs from William, shocked that I memoryholed something, but it turned out to be a software hiccup, and the changes feed was showing something that hadnt appeared on the wiki itself yet (or some such oddity that pops up now and then).  I think once it was Philip, who later noted it.   So there are those who watch the watchers... and they are suitably loudFootnote(Did I mention William was one of the people?) and idealistic.  And again: this applies to Davis Wiki only.  wikispot.org has stuff memoryholed all the time because they are a hub of foul spam and abuse, and arent a real world community in the same way DW is.   jw

20120615 12:23:38 nbsp I tend to agree with you re: letting things fizzle out.  However, the wiki is as consistent as the people who comprise it: pretty much zero consistency.  Nothing wrong with that, as it matches the people of Davis.  It does, however, make it laughable that the wiki does things, as if it were some monolithic entity or group walking in lockstep.

20130227 15:47:21 nbsp Just an observation: in the last year or so, you seem to have time to criticize other editors, but rarely time to contribute productively to the wiki.  That sticks in my craw.  I wouldnt mind the criticism if it was coupled with more productive edits. Users/CovertProfessor
  CP, you criticize people all the time!  Plus you asked for a input on the matter.  Do you just want me to make input that you agree with? JT
    Ill agree with CP here. We rarely see editing from you but you seem to like to raz people. Make a few more edits and I dont think thisd be an issue. Users/PeteB
      Let me repeat what I said.  Its not your criticism that I mind.  Its that we rarely see anything else from you.  Id like to see the productive edits and then please go ahead and criticize away.  cp
       Ok. I find it a little frustrating that I actually did engage the editor and you still made these comments.  I also thought my original suggestion on the Steven Kui Talk page was a constructive contribution, even if you didnt agree with it.  Steven should have been engaged.  An open dialog should be encouraged.  I wasnt trying to criticize anyone, I just wanted him to have a fair say in the matter. As far as editing goes, yes, I find editing the wiki to be a little less enjoyable now, and dont edit like I used to.  These kinds of interactions ruin it for me actually.  Still, if you check my edit history, I think youll find some constructive edits in there.  Anyway, these are my feelings.  You dont have to agree with me. (Note: I edited my original comment.  Arguing over this is counterproductive.)  JT

           Thanks Pete.  I did say I was working, and that should have been respected.  I cant always drop everything for an edit.  Second, I did engage the editor even after saying I was busy, and I still got a pointed comment about not contributing constructively.  Lastly, I dont really appreciate the implication that all I do is criticize people.  My edit history is there for everyone to see, and theres lots of stuff Ive added that is good.  I know some people have their issues with me, but I still try to do what I think is right.  JT

First, it didnt bother me that you disagreed with the suggestion that we limit the number of pictures on a page.  Im not 100% sold on the idea myself.  What bothered me was your accusation that we were trying to punish him or that he was getting steamrolled.  We were in the process of discussing what to do.  All you had to do was to state your opinion and your reasons; it was not necessary to make accusations of other editors while doing so.  Second, by reaching out to him, I assumed you meant inviting him to discuss on the Talk page.  If you did that, you must have done it by phone, because I dont see where you did it on the wiki.  You had time to make all of these edits today, but no time to create his user page (which PeteB did) and invite him to the Talk page, which would have taken all of two minutes.  The fact that you werent in favor of the proposal made you the best person to do it (in addition to the fact that it was your suggestion) because hed see an invitation from someone who was on his side.  And yes, it was a constructive suggestion to reach out to him.  I said that right away.  Third and finally, I never said that all you do is criticize people.  Ill just repeat again what I did in fact say: ...in the last year or so, you seem to have time to criticize other editors, but rarely note this is different from never time to contribute productively to the wiki.

Ok, one last thing.  I also find these conversations draining and offputting.  We all do.  But note that productive edits usually dont lead to them.  So, conversations like this should not put you off from productive edits.  Or, to put the point another way, and say what Im really trying to say:  Jeff, I value your productive edits.  Id like to see more of them. Users/CovertProfessor

  Thanks for the response, CP.  Just to answer your point about reaching out, Stephen was actually never invited into the conversation outright.  He came in on his own, and after he commented, I made http://daviswiki.org/Stephen_Kui_Photography/Talk?actiondiff&version218&version117 this edit encouraging him to make more creative commons photo contributions, and constructive edits to other pages.  It was an attempt to resolve the needs of both parties and it was supported by PeteB.  I was a little frustrated that this happened ten minutes before you left me your comment about criticizing people, but that aside, I appreciate that you value the productive edits that Ive made.  I think we both have the same overarching goals here in that we want a positive, useful environment for users.  Thanks again. JT

  I agree. Great information. I hope others will continue this. Users/DonShor
  Absolutelynice work Jeff. Users/PeteB

20130509  Thanks for the comprehensive grocery shopping list. I work for Whole Foods Market and wanted to make sure that I gave you some updated prices from our store. Hit me up at daivs.info@wholefoods.com or kristen.tantarelli@wholefoods.com

  I appreciate the feedback, Kristen.  I may do an update in the future, but to keep it fair, Ill probably continue the unsolicited approach.  Thanks for offering the price updates though.  If youd like to provide some current price information on the Whole Foods Page, Id totally encourage you to post something.  There are some limits on outright advertising (conflicts with the the 501(c) status of Daviswiki), but I think an objective price list would probably be ok, especially if it were staple items. JT

20130516 16:42:52 nbsp JeffThanks for creating Shared IP Address. Im just not comfortable trying to make one myself yet. Users/PeteB

20130516 19:08:49 nbsp Im trying to figure out in what circumstances youd use your new Shared IP Address include? Users/JabberWokky

20130531 17:31:25 nbsp Hey, Jeff, I suggest we rename Davis to Wind City! Nothing stays the same! Wind isnt rare anymore in Davis. Maybe it is something I brought with me from the rain and wind country Netherlands. ;) A little more rain would be fine too, but not too much.  Users/ConstantiaOomen

20130611 07:30:28 nbsp That is a really fantastic choice for the featured page. Users/JabberWokky
  Agreed!  cp

20130617 15:17:41 nbsp Any chance you could add a picture to the current featured page?  It does look a bit bare. Users/CovertProfessor

20130626 13:37:03 nbsp Thank you for your opinion. Users/CovertProfessor

20130717 13:06:46 nbsp I was just being silly with that last edit: its lighthearted.  Feel free to revert.  :) Users/JabberWokky
  Thanks.  I was offended for about two seconds, and then realized your were most likely messing with me.  :)  JT

20130718 08:19:05 nbsp Good suggestion.  The whole point of the page was to prevent the same argument from occurring over and over again. Users/CovertProfessor

20130909 16:29:27 nbsp I changed it at Jaymes request ) Users/MeggoWaffle
  I see now.  Was able to find a single gender referencing pronon on his website, which Ill take now as the preferred one.  Sucks that most of the existing stories listed on his press page contradicts the website.  I checked through a few of those stories before making the change, and was pretty sure the wiki page was an error.  Either way, good for Jaymes.  Better still, yay for sammies.  JT

20131015 22:22:01 nbsp Suspect is wanted in connection with a police pursuit.  Interestingly circular statement. Users/JabberWokky

20131029 19:08:24 nbsp When do we get more random camera? Also any updates on the guy on the 80 wanted in connection with the police pursuit? Users/StevenDaubert

20131107 17:12:38 nbsp What kind of mac and cheese was it? Users/StevenDaubert
  I believe it was aged chedder or something.  I could have read the menu wrong, it could have been aged chedder on top of M&C or something.  Either way though, it was good, (not kraft M&C).  They had some pictures of it on their faceplant page.

20131118 18:57:49 nbsp I dont want to distract from the focus of the Talk page, but your point that slavishly following precedent as some kind of rule is well made.  I try to treat every wiki edit as standalone: what is the best way in this case.  I probably fall into convenience now and then, but its always worth trying to always reassess from base principles with each edit.  Glad to hear the same idea is held by others. Users/JabberWokky

20131203 21:22:49 nbsp (wind) Thats true. And a lot more to come! :) Users/ConstantiaOomen

20140610 11:22:03 nbsp Hi Jeff, its an average 15 (see TWC) mph; not sure if you consider this a light breeze... Pretty windy IMO, lot of leaves and dead flowers coming down... (wind, June 10, 2014) Users/ConstantiaOomen

20140611 16:12:45 nbsp Yes, knowing is measuring and measuring is knowing... I will now only write given wind speeds and check with the naked eye if this wind speed seems to be correct. Weather Forecast still gives today a 14 mph, but I dont see it, in contrary to yesterday. Well..if it really storms, everyone can tell.  Users/ConstantiaOomen

20140611 18:16:19 nbsp Hi. Wind is getting stronger now. I would love to have a reliable anemometer in my backyard or close... When I am out biking, it is especially clear, in the open field you can feel it better. We will try to approach the wind truth. :) Users/ConstantiaOomen

20140629 22:40:38 nbsp That was a good idea for a community alert. Users/JabberWokky

20140711 08:39:16 nbsp good look Users/StevenDaubert
