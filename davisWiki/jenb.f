My husband and I live in Davis. I graduated Fall 2011 with a degree in Child Development from Sacramento State University Sacramento State. My husband graduated from UC Davis with a degree in Music Composition.
We have one cats cat named Dwight and hopefully we will have a dogs dog someday.

We love to restaurants eat out which is why I have this davis wiki anyways.

I love chocolate, coffee, sewing, photography, swimming, singing, playing guitar/piano/ukelele, reading, crocheting, and of course food. :)

Most of our music is on our bandcamp site http://thebearkeys.bandcamp.com/. We also have a youtube channel http://www.youtube.com/user/thebearkeys/featured for songs were working on, or jingles that we make up while using oven mitts or while driving home.

20110821 17:54:20 nbsp Jos comment was a reply to http://daviswiki.org/Our_House?actiondiff&version250&version149 another comment that got deleted soon after.  I went ahead and deleted Jos comment and yours, since the basis was already removed from the page.  Hope you dont mind.  Also, a belated welcome to the Wiki! Users/TomGarberson

20111206 05:46:33 nbsp Congrats on being preggers! I have a 14 month old and and did a water birth at Sutter Davis. I highly recommend it and using a doula!  Users/jsbmeb

20111206 13:38:07 nbsp Ditto on the congratulations! My little one is due in January (ahhh, so soon!) and Im delivering at Sutter also. Exciting!!! :D Users/JenniferCook

20120102 22:42:58 nbsp Yep, this is my first! I am so ready to have her now, but baby has a different idea of course. I still have 3 weeks left so I shouldnt be too impatient, I suppose. Have you found out the sex yet? That was so exciting for us, and I was completely baffled that the doctor could tell it was a girl from such a blurry image. Maybe our babies can be friends someday! Teehee. Users/JenniferCook

20120112 11:31:50 nbsp I have heard about the Mother and Baby Source classes but I just checked out the Coop one and it looks awesome too! Im totally going to check it out. Thanks for the info! Users/JenniferCook

20120708 14:42:39 nbsp Not to be a stalker or anything, but any baby news?!?! Users/JenniferCook

20120710 08:48:18 nbsp Congratulations!! Users/CovertProfessor

20120710 14:08:03 nbsp Congrats!!!! The eating thing definitely gets easier. Sleeping gets better too. The first month is the hardest, but sooooo worth every moment of it! Users/JenniferCook

20120716 20:41:06 nbsp It gets so much easier, just dont give up! I went to mother and baby source once but I wasnt a huge fan of that group. We go to a (free!) swim class at swim America on Wednesdays instead. We also go to the coop group on Tuesdays (thanks to you!) and another group on Thursdays. I can give you the swim class and Thursday group info if youre interested :) Users/JenniferCook

20120727 10:38:36 nbsp I totally understand! It gets better soon though. Coop group is Tuesdays at 10 in the coop teaching kitchen (across the street from the actual coop) and the other group I go to is on Thursdays at Davis community clinic at 10. If you are interested in the swim class its at swim America on Wednesdays at 9 am and he can start when hes 2 months old, but you should call now since its in high demand. And its free til he is 8 months old! Users/JenniferCook

Nice to meet you too! Funny, I just logged in to leave you a message and saw that you just left one for me a few minutes ago. I just wanted to let you know that a few other mamas and I usually meet up at the farmers market if you are interested in joining us :)  jenn

20121003 12:22:23 nbsp I dont know if youll get this in time but we will be at the farmers market this afternoon if you want to join us! Ill probably get there around 44:15 and we will be on a blanket on the grass! Users/JenniferCook

20130509 10:36:31 nbsp Oh, some spammer posted junk to a bunch of peoples profiles, including yours.  I just went around and removed it.  No worries, I was just trying to keep the wiki spamfree!  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
