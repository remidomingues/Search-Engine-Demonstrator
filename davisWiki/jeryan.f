Welcome to the Wiki Howdy, Jo Ellen... fantastic work on the West Pond and Friends of West Pond entries!  I had added an antispam macro to your email address... that makes it so that when a person views the page, they see an email address, clickable if they are logged in.  If they are a computer trying to automatically find email addresses to spam, then it doesnt show up as an email address.  Its a little confusing to edit, but easy to use for people trying to email you.  If you have any questions, check out the wiki:wikispot:Help with Macros or just ask!

20080909 17:13:25 nbsp You are very kind. I spent a couple of hours getting all the photos and text edited today and then hit some ^@$#$&%! button and lost them all. I must learn to save as I go, although I hate seeing the long record of changes.

Any advice you have? I know, read the instructions!

20080909 19:19:58 nbsp Youre doing fine.  Normally somebody would probably tell you to use preview more often and save less often (nobody likes those long change records), but if youre having problems, dont worry about it  take your time and when you have a bit more experience, youll be editing like a pro!  If you have any specific questions, remember that theres a whole community of editors who are willing to help out. Users/JabberWokky
