20100224 12:40:07 nbsp Hey, as I wrote on your old editor account: It was never locked... it was simply zeroed out, which every person on the wiki can do.  Everybody (including you) can delete, rewrite or change any content on the wiki.  No worries... Ill go revert the page (which means bring it back to a previous version, another thing you can do as well).  If you have any questions, just ask  were a community of volunteers here (just like you), and there are plenty of people who can help you out.  Welcome to the wiki!
