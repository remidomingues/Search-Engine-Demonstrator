20090323 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy Ms. or Mr. Gilbert, and Welcome to the Wiki!   My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for working on the iBIN entry... it looks like the original file you were trying to upload was corrupted or made by a buggy program.  I cropped and converted it to a proper JPEG, and it now works.  By the way, you can thumbnail an image using markup (of course, its easier to figure out when youre working with a proper image file, rather than an oddball one like you had!).  Once again, welcome to the wiki! Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20110614 08:27:55 nbsp A question about recycling. If those taking materials with CRVs are stealing from ratepayers by increasing the cost of city services paid for by selling the recycling material, isnt bringing those materials to the center yourself and getting the five cents back increasing the costs as well? I personally have no problem with people taking my recyclables as long as they dont leave a mess and who knows, it might be even more beneficial to the environment since most of them ride bicycles while doing it. And instead of using city resources to send a crew and truck out, they do it for no additional incentives other than the five cents that I was forced to pay for when buying my ten cent water bottle at Costco.

20110712 08:59:18 nbsp HankimCRV funds that are not redeemed come back to local jurisdictions in the form of grant money. In theory, if no one redeemed their CRV funds, the Cities and Counties in CA would get more grant money from the State to operate recycling programs. If CRV containers are redeemed at DWR, DWR still gets money for recycling the glass, plastic and cans. When CRV containers are redeemed at the other 2 CRV redemption centers in town, DWR gets none of the recycling money. People taking their OWN recyclalbes to other CRV redemption centers in town is not a problem. Thats a small percentage. People stealing CRV containers is a bigger problem because they take so much more material. This is a double whammyno grant funds coming back to the City AND a decrease in the recycling funds for DWR that help subsidize the cost of collecting the recycling citywide. I hope that helps to answer your question. Users/jgilbert

20110720 20:21:05 nbsp Hi Gilbert, I would like to know why the city of Davis uses a divided plastic residential recycle bin, they dont hold very much compared to Sacramento, Woodland, and other areas, as a contractor Ive seen this throughout Davis, people dont separate their garbage, thats just a fact. And a lot of recycling is just tossed in the garbage can. Without over thinking it, why not; like else where, one decent size recycle bin, for all of your recycling?  Users/Theangrydiner

20120322 21:45:24 nbsp P.S. on the plastic bag pics  do you think you could add information about when/where (approximately) the pics were taken, so that people would know that they are recent/local? Users/CovertProfessor
