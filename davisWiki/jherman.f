20100715 07:43:10 nbsp curious as to how much a burrito actually costs to make.  I see on the website they have a 25% gross profit margin but probably a bunch of things wrapped up in that.  Does anyone know?  They are big portions and reasonably priced so I like it but really curious. Users/tombe

20101010 21:07:20 nbsp Ok  you should have said so at first.  It appeared as though you were just deleting negative comments, but if someone is impersonating someone else, thats a different story in my view.  Not that I have any authority around here; Im just another editor like you.  But I will go ahead and redelete the comments now that I understand why you deleted them in the first place.

20101011 13:56:46 nbsp FYI the blood in underwear comment is a reference to an episode of south park titled Dead Celebrities

It has a subplot in which Cartman eats Chipotle despite bloody defecation until the invention of Chipotleaway  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Celebrities

Its a joke (albeit a gross one) and therefore I believe its not meant to be hurtful/offensive.  Users/OliviaY

20101011 15:02:22 nbsp 20101010 20:21:26   Hi Peter my name is Joe and I have a restaurant downtown called Chipotle. Somebody has been using my managers name and employee number to slander the restaurant and steal her identity. Do you have a way to ping back to the address or do you know somebody that can? Thanks Joe Chipotle jherman@chipotle.com â€”jherman  Users/PeterBoulay
    Joethx for checking in. I called your restaurant a week or so ago to make you guys aware this was occuring. I want to see what other editors think about how to address this concern.
