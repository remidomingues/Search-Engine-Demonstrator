20110726 13:02:02 nbsp A belated Welcome to the Wiki!  Actually, the wikis all about including opinion.  Check out the discussion on Neutral Point of View  the long and short of it is that the wiki community rejects NPOV, and instead tries to incorporate many points of view

I would also tend to agree with CovertProfessor that the link to a news article on the Patch network is quite relevant, in the same way information about the ingredients in Taco Bells meat is relevant to the Taco Bell locations in Davis.  Davis Patch gets its local employees and volunteers locally, which renders that kind of information quite relevant. Users/TomGarberson

Also, you may wish to read Cut that comment bar out  a lot of people dont like the comment bar because it promotes the very confusion you are displaying, i.e., people mistakenly thinking that opinions must be banished to some special comment section.  But that is not how this wiki works. Users/CovertProfessor
