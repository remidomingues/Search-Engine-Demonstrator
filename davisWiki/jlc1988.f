20100128 20:12:37 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. Thanks for creating the Curtis Computing Solutions page. Just to bring you up to speed there have been some issues with pages about local computer repair businesses and I thought Id share some information with you. For instance see BEAR License because at least one computer repair business owner was discussing those and brought the issue up. See Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner for some more bits of advice.

20100727 13:20:59 nbsp Could you please stop putting in unnecessary general headers like http://daviswiki.org/Curtis_Computing_Solutions?actionrecall&version38 this? Users/WilliamLewis

20100727 13:25:54 nbsp Thats fine with me, but you should have just removed the header (Not taken out the additional information I just added) Users/jlc1988

20100727 13:28:00 nbsp What did I remove besides the headers? Users/WilliamLewis

20100727 13:33:06 nbsp Sorry I went back and read and you didnt remove anything else. My bad, its easy to miss the change in topic without the header there. Users/jlc1988

20100727 13:34:14 nbsp Putting a single sentence after a new header is bad style. Headers are a guide to overall structure and unnecessary in short documents. Users/WilliamLewis

20100727 13:36:59 nbsp Okay, I see your point, but without those in that header a user will scan over that last sentence and it will be lost. What can I do to keep this from happening? Users/jlc1988

20100727 13:38:18 nbsp Hi James, and another, belated, Welcome to the Wiki.  I love the 3d models!  I was noticing this morning that the KCRA news appears to use a Google Earth map of Sacramento for certain angles during its weather reports, and that includes 3D models of a lot of the downtown buildings.

One thing to note: the huge 3d headers on relatively small pages (like Pizza Guys) make it seem almost like thats the central theme of the page.

My suggestion would be to make an index page for something like Buildings in 3D on Google Earth which lists all of the buildings and attributes each to whomever modeled it.  Then, for each of the pages for businesses in those buildings, you can have a tag noting that You can see this building in 3D via Google Earth with a link to the index page. Users/TomGarberson

20100727 13:43:03 nbsp Oh, I see that your problem is that insufficient attention is drawn to your work vs. the business the page is actually about. Yes, its cool that youre doing these models, but the models have nothing to do with the business in question. Why should they be the huge elephant on the page, then? Users/WilliamLewis

20100727 13:43:23 nbsp Sounds fair enough, thanks for the tip. To create an Index Page can I just create a normal page and then list the buildings or is there something special I have to do for that? Users/jlc1988
  Just a normal page.  Itd be cool to describe a bit about the process of creating the models and getting them added to Google Earth, too.  Then you can just do a bulleted list of modeled buildings, or whatever. tg
  Thanks, Ill go ahead and do that then. Users/jlc1988

20100727 13:49:36 nbsp Yes, that was originally my problem. And I dont want it to overtake the page, thats not my intention. However that is the only way I know of to distiguish that it is information about a model of the building and not of the business itself. Also, these models have everything to do with the business in question as they are models of the physical building that the business is located in. Giving users the ability to see what the building that the business is located in looks like as well as exactly where it is located at. Users/jlc1988
  Plus, its cool :) I think weve found a good solution. tg

20100727 13:56:28 nbsp Yeah, thanks for all the help. Ill go get started on the page. Users/jlc1988

20100727 14:03:32 nbsp I have created this page http://daviswiki.org/Buildings_in_3D_on_Google_Earth and will continue to add to it. If anyone else has any information about 3D modeling in Google earth or knows of any models feel free to add them. Users/jlc1988

20100727 15:50:32 nbsp A suggestion for organizing the modeled buildings.  You might want to list the building itself (e.g. 123 A St.), then list the individual businesses found there.  For example:

  123 L St. (home to Taqueria Davis, Aggie Liquor, ...)

Or
  123 L St.
   Taqueria Davis
   Aggie Liquor
   ...

Also, linking the businesses is always a plus :)  And of course, if youd like help with anything, just ask! Users/TomGarberson
  20100727 16:18:06 nbsp Yeah, I was just thinking of doing it this way then I had to leave and was trying to do it on my phone, but that didnt work too good so I gave up till I got home lol. Thanks for the ideas. Users/jlc1988

20100727 17:15:39 nbsp A cool addition for 3D modeling might be a small screenshot of each building.  After uploading the images to the page, if you stick this line right above the line for the building: {{{Image(name.jpg, thumbnail, 50, right, noborder, Description)}}} would give you a nice, little image to the right of the building and the list of businesses in it. Users/TomGarberson

20100727 17:33:37 nbsp Do you know is there any way to embed objects into a page on davis wiki? Then I would be able to put a small area to let people browse around google earth. Users/jlc1988

20110806 22:23:22 nbsp Looks like you were doing some work on Wanted Pages?  Thanks! Users/TomGarberson

20111202 19:35:54 nbsp Hey James, someone else removed the thats just an opinion and I removed the some think regarding the wings on Dominos.  In general its better to add opinions so a page represents more viewpoints, rather than to try and remove or undermine an existing one.  We generally dont try to keep the tone on the wiki NPOV neutral.  The goal is to represent many viewpoints rather than none. Users/TomGarberson

20111203 18:27:24 nbsp Sorry about that, I guess Im just used to other wikis where there arent generally supposed to be opinions, just facts. My bad, Ill keep that in mind in future editing. Users/jlc1988
