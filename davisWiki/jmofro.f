JMo works at UC Davis, and is enjoying biking everywhere for the first time in her life although she doesnt like getting blown over when trying to bike on campus during spring. She loves to cook, eat, try new things, and spend time outside with her Labrador.

20110410 10:57:14 nbsp Hi, you made an interesting post on one of the restaurant pages that passports are not accepted as a valid form of identification at some bars, ect. Do you know if there is an exception for foreign passports, since that is the only form of identification they would have. Sounds a bit racist for an establishment not to be allowing foreign people in. Users/MattHh
