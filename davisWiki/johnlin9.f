20080701 18:21:33 nbsp Howdy! Oftentimes, when a page can have two or more names, the best thing is to create a http://daviswiki.org/Templates/Redirect?actionshow redirect so that they all lead to a single page. Users/JoePomidor

20080701 18:24:04 nbsp Hey, I deleted your Squareshaped tomato entry because you copied and pasted the text without any of the links or markup.  If youd like to rename entries in the future, you can do so (and copy all attached photos and such) by clicking Edit and then the Rename button on the bar at the bottom of the edit page.  By the way, as far as I know, the name of the tomato is Square tomato, and it isnt actually square shaped.  Regardless, welcome to the wiki! Users/JabberWokky
