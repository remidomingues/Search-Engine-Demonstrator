20110512 12:10:21 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki!  Please take a moment to read over the Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner page.  It explains a lot about the wikis purpose and what sort of stuff to expect as a business owner/affiliate on the wiki.  One of the big taboos is removing information (unless of course its wrong, in which case it should be replaced with the correct info).  I couldnt quite follow what you were saying in the edit comment when you removed the information on EZ Smog (the edit note length limit is really short).  I reverted the change because it seemed like valid, fairly detailed information.  If you want to discuss the content of the page, theres a little button at the top of each page labeled Talk.  Click on that and itll take you to a new talk page.  Click on the edit button or on the little link there to create this page and you can explain the problem with the content there.  Or, for a quick shortcut, just click here: {{{EZ Smog/Talk}}} and create the page. Users/TomGarberson
