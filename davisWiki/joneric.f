I am a Engineering Civil Engeneering major.
I might commonly be sighted at the Silo getting some fast food, or at Surge IV distracting people that are trying to study for real. I ride my fixie around town looking all cool, except that I got a break now :(. I have the coolest Users/mydiaz girlfriend anyone could ask for with the coolest major in the world (Environmental Toxicology)...Im kinda jealous, actually!

...A girlfriend who apparently, cannot spell.
