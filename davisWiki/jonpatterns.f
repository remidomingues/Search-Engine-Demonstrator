Behind schedule, but nearly complete.  I had intended to be done Tuesday, and was running a couple days behind schedule then.  Yesterday I had a migraine (if I count correctly, the sixth Ive ever had) and got absolutely nothing done all day.  I should be done in the next few days.

Completely done.  I had wanted to roll them out initially as a Chrome app, but Philip hasnt authorized my account to add a Chrome app for Davis Wiki (Google doesnt allow you to add it to their web store unless your account is authorized for that domain).  I have a workaround solution, but its annoying and problematic (frame the wiki inside another site).  Thanks for bugging me... Ill ask Philip one more time, and then if I dont get a response, Ill just do the workaround.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
