20130410 18:03:29 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki, Jon.  I have read your comment and all I can say is...wow. That is all VERY disturbing...very cultish. Very scary. It appears you have had some time to heal and recover. Hope others can gain some wisdom from your testimony. Users/PeteB

20130506 15:09:10 nbsp Jonyou posted the same info on Waypoint as on Gracepoint Davis Church. You are aware that they arent relatedright??? Doesnt seem to fair to cast aspersions on another group unrelated to the organization you actually did have issues with. Please join in the discussion on Waypoint/TalkUsers/PeteB

20130912 12:18:13 nbsp Jon please be aware that if you click on the info tab, you can see the name or info about anyone posting a comment. With the material youre posting being so inflammatory you should properly attribute your comments. I have reattributed your comments to your name. Users/PeteB

20130913 10:26:22 nbsp That is fine, it was probably deleted by accident when I edited it Users/jonwoo

20130913 16:25:42 nbsp Jon: Sorry man but I find this difficult to believe thisreason being because you removed your name from Gracepoint Davis Church as well and thats the only edit you made. If youre wondering I have no affiliation with Gracepoint or Koinonia in any manner. Users/PeteB

20130918 11:43:47 nbsp I figured it was unwise to leave an email address up, so i meant to delete that. I guess I deleted the name too when i did that Users/jonwoo
