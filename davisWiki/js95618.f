20120907 08:45:01 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki.  I dont think companies are required to have a license in the City of Davis as long as they have a valid license elsewhere.  If cabs dont have valid insurance thats a problem, but your commentary is pretty vague. Users/TomGarberson

20130131 09:13:59 nbsp Please dont make changes to the Front Page.  On a separate note, I think Ill probably be catching a ride from an Uber cab tomorrow for the Art of Beer festival in Sacramento, since it sounds like you guys have a deal with the organizers.  Not sure whether Bluebird will be a part of that, but if so, maybe Ill see you then. Users/TomGarberson
