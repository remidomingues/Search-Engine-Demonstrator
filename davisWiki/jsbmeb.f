Im a local non local travel writer and blogger.  http://interactiveexpat.blogspot.com Interactive Expat
We (as in Royal: husband, son and I) now live in the Land Park area of SacTown.
I already miss walking downtown from our house on D. But I will console myself with the fact that Im still in Davis 3 times a week.
Lived in China August 08 June 10. My husband taught at a University in Beijing. Learning Chinese is the hardest thing weve ever done, but spending a couple years in China was worth it and has paid off. We are considering making a move back so our son will be able to speak fluent Chinese.
I love checking the wiki and staying current with town happenings no matter what part of the world I happen to be in. While not a drama hound, I do enjoy spicy wiki controversy.
I am also user Users/Myabrn Myabrn, but do to some strangeness ( I blame phantom internet spies) , I could not log into that account anymore so here I am again.

20110404 13:57:38 nbsp You were looking for Theakston Old Peculier... it is not distributed to the United States. If anyone could get it, itd be the Beer Shoppe, but I believe all their stock is beers that are otherwise distributed here. Users/JustinKudo

20110519 21:23:13 nbsp Is there just the one truck pictured on Crystal Dairy Home Delivery or is there an older truck also? Users/BruceHansen

20110531 22:49:13 nbsp You posted: Hi Jason, by your post on Ducks, its very clear that you feel strongly about them. Wheres the policy that says the University doesnt care about ducks?

If you read my comment, I never used University  instead, I used Arboretum.  The basis for my remarks about the Arboretum is due to my many conversations with the Arboretum officials to remove abandoned ducks that were left to die.  For example, couldnt the Arboretum leave signs telling people not to abandon domestic ducks because they will most likely die to due predation.  Also, the Arboretum continues to advertise false information about feeding leads to increase duck population, which is contrary to established data (i.e. duckling mortality rate is over 80%), when in fact the duck overpopulation is due to abandoned domestic ducks.

20110607 19:56:43 nbsp Personally, I thought it went over the line, but Tom was so amused, I figured I can wait it out a bit.  I do think it is true: these things tend to just burn out if you let them run their course.  Cleaning up in the midst of the fracas tends to make them bigger by giving the upset parties somebody to push against and get even more worked up. Users/JabberWokky

20110616 12:41:37 nbsp Its {{{wiki:westsac:Page Name}}} Users/TomGarberson

20110616 13:31:22 nbsp No problem.  I always have a hard time finding the interwiki link stuff.  Its somewhere in the wiki:Wikispot Help with Editing set of pages.  Then you have to find the name of the wiki for linking purposes.  Theres Nearby Wikis, or wiki:Wikispot Wiki Directory which has the short names of most of the significant Wiki Spotbased wikis out there. Users/TomGarberson

20110620 15:49:09 nbsp Glad to know that its not just me who gets confused!  :) Users/CovertProfessor

20110716 15:25:19 nbsp I have not!  Worth a visit? Users/TomGarberson

20110716 16:25:29 nbsp Looks like thats only about 8 blocks from work :)  Next time Ive got a slow day Ill try and make it over there for lunch!  Sounds really good. Users/TomGarberson

20110914 11:32:29 nbsp Id like to think of it as a pool rather than a club, and I for one am always happy to see you dip a toe in.  Id be even more pleased if youd come in for a long swim.  Come on in, the waters fine! Users/CovertProfessor

20110929 11:45:27 nbsp Oh HAI!  Nice to officially wikimeet you!  Thanks for following my blog; Im so totally cyberblushing right now!  Interactive Expat would have been nice to know about whilst mucking through the MSG and censors and smog that are Beijing.  I loved it, dont get me wrongare you heading back there at any point?  Im trying to figure out a way to do that, at some point.  Also, your Aliengrammarcartoon is fabulous.  Users/JoannaSwan

20111008 21:33:08 nbsp Yes, please! The help I mean...I created a page but its a little wonky, edits will be appreciated!

 Users/jwendt

20111107 07:08:49 nbsp This probably wont solve the problem, but it might help: http://lifehacker.com/5252183/cleanupandreviveyourbloatedsluggishmac some improvement stuff.   The maintenance stuff about disk permissions really helped my gfs macbook. Users/EdWins

20111108 22:11:43 nbsp I think its really cool that you can speak Chinese. I have been learning Japanese off and on for like 10 years, and yet I still have a feeling my quest is probably a lot easier than yours was. That tonal stuff of Chinese just blows my mind. I dont know if I could ever wrap my head around that. Can you also read and write hanzi? I totally think you should force your son to learn Chinese, by the way; otherwise your learning has all been for nought. Heheheh.  Users/ScottMeehleib

20111109 14:29:07 nbsp I know how it is to only be able to write most of the characters with a computer. For me, one of the drawbacks of selfteaching  is Ill study a lot in the areas I enjoy like vocabulary and kanjirecognition with flash cards. But Ive always been too lazy for intensive grammar study and actual handwriting. Anyway, have fun in China!  Users/ScottMeehleib

20111213 06:04:43 nbsp You wrote: That comment I made was like a year ago almost exactly. So in response, we are essentially talking about the same thing?  Yes, I did make that comment over a year ago.  And the University is not the same as Arboterum since you implied uniforminity or unity, which may not be true.  The Arboretum and University may in fact have different goals. Users/jasoncw

20111216 11:57:56 nbsp Were off to Beijing again...will be updating the travel blog. :) Users/jsbmeb

20120102 12:56:52 nbsp Thanks! Sorry for the late reply, weve been traveling up a storm visiting fam. Ill be 15 weeks preggers tomorrow :) Im already starting to pop a little. My friend is a doula so Im planning on enlisting her services, doulas are awesome. :) Users/jenb

20120108 14:53:12 nbsp I sometimes misread things.  I looked again when I thought you said Happy Ending. Users/BruceHansen

20120202 20:17:18 nbsp I just wanted to let you know that you got me hooked on your China blog. You are a great writer and you choose interesting topics! Users/ScottMeehleib

20120206 21:04:19 nbsp Hello jsbmeb,
I too speak Chinese, learned it in Taiwan many years ago.
As for home repair outside of Davis, not often, however
what did you have in mind and what is your location?
Thanks for your inquiry,

20120208 07:36:26 nbsp Thanks so much for your work on the Comfort Suites page and talk page! Users/TomGarberson

20120208 07:39:13 nbsp Yes, thank you!  I see what you man about the he said/she said.  I think readers will draw their own conclusions.  Some will side with one, some will side with the other, and some will declare a wash.  It probably says more about the reader than what is being read! Users/CovertProfessor

20120219 21:38:54 nbsp Nice quotes on EWs page.  Yesterday my wife asked me to proofread something she wrote.  I told her that I make a pass through my work deleting all the unnecessary words. Good to see my approach validated. Users/JimStewart

20120222 10:30:43 nbsp Wikimouse looked like a spammer to me, although I could well be wrong. Users/TomGarberson

20120222 10:35:23 nbsp To me as well, although I really like the name due to my own personal biases.  Still, Id say that your reply and edit were the right way as a first pass. Users/JabberWokky

20120305 13:21:08 nbsp Thanks for your efforts, too! I usually try to lurk on drama. Whenever I waste additional time chiming in instead of just reading, I always regret it... Users/MeggoWaffle

 Users/Davidlm

20120323 19:14:33 nbsp Thanks for your efforts. I dont have the stamina to continue (lol) so Im going to leave it to JW. Im pretty sure this guy will keep you going all night if we let him so may as well not let ourselves get too stressed about it. :( Users/ScottMeehleib

20120328 18:01:08 nbsp Oops.  Good catch. Users/CovertProfessor

20120415 13:26:44 nbsp Okay. My personal feeling is that the page uses an excessive amount of bullets and examples which make it come across more like a personal resume rather than a typical, casuallywritten wiki entry. I could be wrong so Ill make a talk page to see what others think. I have to admit that I was purposely looking for flaws to correct because this is one of several pages that has been flagged for advertising for a long time. Nobody has seemingly taken an issue as to whether or not it is an advert since then, and the very fact that it is flagged is probably not helping his business in any case. So it would be good if more people put their input in. Users/ScottMeehleib

20120420 20:48:53 nbsp Sure.  :)  Sometimes its hard to hunt down the error! Users/CovertProfessor

20120421 20:48:36 nbsp I saw yer comment on the East Davis Library in a Box about wanting to bring some books by.  Sure, thatd be great! Alternatives to consider include donating to a Sac Little Free Library or starting your own. Users/JoaquinFeliciano

20120724 14:16:50 nbsp Im not familiar with Black Lion.  You should hit up the Beer Shoppe, though.  If they dont have it, ask Taylor and I imagine hell be happy to order it. Users/TomGarberson

20120724 15:26:01 nbsp Totally unrelated... have you been to Tako in midtown Sacramento?  Freaking fantastic.  Korean BBQ in tacos, burritos, sliders, etc.  Om nom. Users/TomGarberson
