20110331 13:57:07 nbsp Good addition for West Davis/Restaurants!  Youd think Id remember those, since I used to hit up that Subway at least 12 times per week, and still live really close by.  IMO it counts as West Davis, even if there are people who might nitpick. Users/TomGarberson

20110702 13:41:04 nbsp They have the Thursday one near the Sutter Davis Hospital, not downtown. Unless they ended it? Users/hankim

20110809 21:16:43 nbsp Ive seen her in downtown Sacramento near work before, as well. Users/TomGarberson

20110909 07:39:57 nbsp Yeah.  Like kinda hilly or warped.  Not to a large degree, but enough that you can feel it. Users/IDoNotExist

20110911 23:10:35 nbsp Maybe rosepetal meant stuck up front as in long lines at Nugget? Which is true on bus days there I have to wait up to 10 minutes to finally pay for things, even If I am 2nd in line. Users/ndah100

20110911 23:18:25 nbsp Both safeways are in ideal locations, west Davis is right by campus/hospital. And it close to many apartment complexes filled with students, so it attacts many students.
Other safeway by downtown is ideal also, close to many apartment complexes that are filled with college students. Props to safeway for building there stores there.
I rarely see college student at nugget, seems to be the mom and pop crowd. Where it is impossible to navigate on Sunday afternoons.

But I cannot see nugget having bad customer service, i shop there over once a week for last year.  Users/ndah100

20110924 12:01:57 nbsp Thank you for adding info about you being busser. I was starting to wonder how you knew so much about paesanos.. Users/ndah100

20120414 17:28:25 nbsp Its basic search and seizure law. A peace officer can compel a search for weapons with wiki:wikipedia:Terry stop reasonable suspicion (not an issue here) and anything else with wiki:wikipedia:Search_and_seizure#United_States probable cause. Depending on the circumstances, a warrant may be required. But thats only if someone is a http://www2.courtinfo.ca.gov/protem/courses/jury/stats/pc_830.htm peace officer, which Aggie Hosts arent. Theyre security guards. At best, they can ask you to leave (trespass), but they cant look through your stuff without your consent.

Im not an attorney, just someone who knows my rights. Go verify this with a real lawyer if you wish.  Users/WilliamLewis
