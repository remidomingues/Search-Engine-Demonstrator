20100626 18:08:33 nbsp Hello and welcome to the wiki.  I would suggest that you post individual reviews of Richard Kennedy Jr, DDS Dr. Kennedy and David Jolkovsky, DMD MS Dr. Jolkovsky on the business pages for each of them.  It will be easier for other users to find them there.  I am considering posting this comment to both pages if you do not do this in the next few weeks.  Many people do not read the reviews on the dentist page but read reviews on the page for the individual business.  Do any other editors feel it would be not appropriate to move the comment?
