I am a local landscape and interior designer with my own business, Inside Out. I have been designing landscapes since 1999. I have been certified  through the Association of Professional Landscape Designers since 2001 and have been on both the local and the state Board for this organization.  I design and (now) install landscapes. I hold a C27  landscape contractors license. I believe in connections from the inside out. I have a BA in Interior Design and am an Associate member with American Society of Interior Designers.
My husband and I moved to Davis in 1981 and have raised two boys here. I was involved with school, sports and music throughout their school years.
I have been involved in both University Farm Circles Holiday Home Tour and the Pence Gallery Garden Tour for many years.
I work mainly in the Davis area. If you are interested in seeing my work, please check out my website @ www. insideoutjoni.biz
what I love about Davis: Davis Farmers Market, the Davis Bike Trails 12 mile loop, walking through the UC Davis Arboretum and the people that I have met.
