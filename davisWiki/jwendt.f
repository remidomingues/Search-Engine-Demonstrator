I am a Davisites Davisite!

20110803 09:00:40 nbsp Im confused... first you say that PureBeauty has relocated, and then you say that its closed  which is it?  If its closed, then we still keep the page around for historical reasons and mark it as departed.  If its moved, we can indicate that, too.  But please dont delete the content, which belongs to the Davis community, from the Wiki. Users/CovertProfessor
    She did the ah, a delete button... Ill use it to delete this one bit of text, and accidentally deleted the whole thing.  It happens now and then.  I got a polite but panicy email that I just read. jw

20110803 09:45:32 nbsp Hey, I just got your email.  No worries... people accidentally delete entries now and then.  Its easy to restore them (CovertProfessor already has).  Although sometimes people think youre trying to remove the whole thing (thus the questions). Users/JabberWokky

20111008 21:09:44 nbsp Hi, Maybe you would like to start your own Business page. I would be happy to help if needed. Its a bit confusing in the Pure Beauty page. :) Users/jsbmeb

20111017 16:12:25 nbsp Did you add it to the the salons page? Users/JabberWokky

20111019 06:16:40 nbsp Hi sorry it took me a long time to reply. Added girlgonegreen to Beauty Salons and Barber Shops :) Users/jsbmeb

20120405 10:07:38 nbsp No problem.  You add thumbnail and how big you want it.  You can also add a caption to each of them.  I added an example caption to the door photo, but feel free to add whatever explains what is in the photo.  Just like all thumbnailed photos, you can click on them to view them full size.

The Image() format can be a little confusing.  If you mess anything up, dont worry about it... somebody will notice and come along to help fix it. Users/JabberWokky
