Please read Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner; it will help explain how you can make the wiki a positive experience for you without clashing with established wiki social norms. Things like sockpuppeting (the practice of pretending to be other people to make it appear that more people share your point of view) and removing other peoples comments clash with established Wiki Community standards.

When there are three very similar looking reviews in a row posted from the same IP address, then people will discount what you have to say and it will backfire on you. Users/ElleWeber
