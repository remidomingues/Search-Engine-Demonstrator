Hello there and welcome to DavisWiki! I see that youre making edits to Rodness Martial Arts Center. Have you read Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner?

Im looking a the http://daviswiki.org/Rodness_Martial_Arts_Center?actioninfo edit history for Rodness and I see that five different editors have undone the edits youve made to that page. If you explained why youre deleting what you are, you probably would be more successful than the current situation where you edit and then someone undoes your edits. If youre interested in providing an explanation, you can do so at {{{Rodness Martial Arts Center/Talk}}}.

Please let me know if you have any more questions.  Users/WilliamLewis
