20100131 20:08:35 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. Interwiki links are a great way of avoiding putting copies of the same page on multiple wikis. To create on you would type {{{wiki:davis:Fiesta DanceN Fitness}}} which would result in wiki:davis:Fiesta DanceN Fitness. I mention this because I glanced at your http://daviswiki.org/Users/katya?actionuserinfo edit history and see that youve created copies on several local wikis. At some point the duplication of the same content on so many wikis starts to look like spam rather than adding useful information. Please read Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner. Users/JasonAller

20100204 17:48:57 nbsp Hey, katya... You should probably be aware that Wiki Spot (and thus all Wiki Spot wikis, including Davis Wiki) is a nonprofit, and you cant put commercial advertising on here.  Im letting you know, as it looks like you kind of crossed the line from describing Fiesta DanceN Fitness over to advertising Fiesta DanceN Fitness, so its likely that somebody will come along and remove much of that to keep it from being commercial in nature.  Its not personal, and its kind of a common mistake for business owners who are new to the wiki.  The wiki is an effort to document the community of Davis, not a business listings site.
