20091008 11:57:58 nbsp Welcome to the wiki!  Please consider the importance of using your RealName.  Im not disproving your claims or questioning your motives about computer repair businesses lacking business licenses but Id like to note that the City of Davis Business License database is woefully out of date: last update was February 26, 2009   which is a very long time in the large turnover rate of the business world.  I dont know anything about California repair licensing so I cant make any remarks there. But their database is supposedly up to date (Oct 7). Users/RyanMikulovsky

20091008 12:00:37 nbsp Also, cant an individual simply be DBA Computer Repair Inc.?  I do not think that requires a business license, does it?  The individual would then simply report income in their normal IRS filings. Users/PhilipNeustrom

20091008 19:48:34 nbsp Im in no way an expert on this, but couldnt someone incorporate out of state (say, in Delaware), and therefore perhaps not need to get a business license for CA?  (I dont know if these are two unrelated things or not.) Users/IDoNotExist

20091009 15:14:15 nbsp just so you know it is not a data base.  The city of davis was contacted by myself and they replied in an email to me of which businesses do not have liscenses.  Also the state department of electronic repair was contacted and they also confirmed the list of people.  I thought that the wiki was there to inform people of companies and their activites to help the consumer.  You have removed the remarks which leads me to believe that you have your own agenda.  Please respond before i begin to blogg about this to other web sites.  You allow the most rediculious remarks to be written on everybody web sites but when the truth comes out it is snuffed.  I will be contacting the local newspaper about this.  I have not used my real name due to the attacks that I might personally get.   Users/keepingitlegal
   Really?  Thats actually the tactic youre going with here?  Demanding that you get your way without any conversation or clarification on your part or youll tell people you didnt get your way because of some oddball conspiracy?  People thought you were using a database and that your edits were well meaning but mislead, they all contacted you with ways to help you out and shared what theyve learned about the various public sources of information, and you immediately claim that people reaching out to help you is actually a grand faceless but omnipotent threat?  Is that really how you view this?  I have news for you: there is no singular you that removed the remarks, and there is no agenda.  I certainly dont agree with many of the edits other people make.  I think many of the choices that others make here on the wiki are short sighted and cause horrible problems, and Ive raised those issues again and again over the years.  But I dont blame not getting my way on a conspiracy against me.  I am not happy with the way that a large chunk of the wiki works, and the edits I make are often reversed over time.  Are you really saying that there is some kind of conspiracy working against me?  Here I thought it was just a bunch of individuals, all of whom have different ideas of what the wiki should be.  Should I call the newspapers over the fact that I dont like comments in entries?  Should I start to bloggsic about this to other web sites because I dont get my way?  With that mentality, what the heck do you do when your spouse wants something for dinner thats different than what you want?  Claim that chicken pot pies are part of an agenda and threaten to call the media?  Honestly, Im utterly boggled that you really think that a few individuals thinking you were using outdated and misleading information is some kind of sweeping agenda against your person.

20091009 15:15:12 nbsp According to the City of Davis, anybody doing business in davis needs to have a business liscense. Users/keepingitlegal

20091009 16:34:21 nbsp Thanks for clarifying.  Somebody probably removed your comments because they werent fully explained (people asked questions here).  Feel free to add them back, but keep in mind that it looks suspicious that youve come and added a bunch of comments related to computer repair establishments.  Theres likely a whole bunch of businesses in Davis operating without a business license (say, dog sitting services). Users/PhilipNeustrom

20091009 18:23:10 nbsp For people who are following along, I just got off a long, pleasant phone call with the person behind this account.  He had been very very frustrated that he could not figure out who to go to about the wiki or why users were questioning and deleting his edits.  It didnt help that a brand new anonymous account (http://daviswiki.org/Users/mononucleosis?actionuserinfo mononucleosis) did the bulk of the deleting.  I guess Jim had also talked to him prior to him calling me, as he was much more informed when I spoke to him, and had some very practical, reasonable questions.  He said (as he does above) that he did do the proper research and contacted the city.  Personally, if the information is truthful, I think it makes sense to go on the entry in the same way that the history of the company, the building it occupies or the chain or coop status of the company should be there: it is a tiny bit more information about that part of Davis.  Like Philip, I suggested that he add them back (and that he date them so they age), and that the new account looked suspicious until he started explaining and talking to people. Hes still a bit of a novice in how things work on the wiki, but I did explain that people would help him out if he asked.  In short, he made a bad first impression, but seems to gave good intent.

  Thanks for working things out among wiki editors (yet again).  Did you get any explanation of why computer services in particular were being singled out?  And I have to ask whether this person has any connection to A.S. Computers, a new page that was created on the same day.  It may just have been a coincidence, of course, but I think its relevant if not.  Of course, truth is truth even if it comes from a competitor (or a friend of a competitor).  I did a bit of research, too, and it did seem as though most of the Davis computer service businesses were indeed not registered with the state.  Then again, I am not sure which of those companies do repair, or which just do service, and whether that distinction is relevant here.  It seems to me as though it might be.   Users/CovertProfessor
     Several comments above, Jason asks if he knows Khanh....
      Ah yes, Heron Technologies that answers my questions.

20091026 15:42:51 nbsp Supposidly anyone who does computer reapir needs a license or at least needs to be under a business with such a license. I am in the process of getting all the proper licenses and what not so that I can continue to out do the competitors in Davis.  Users/RealComputers

20091027 15:54:26 nbsp I now have a business license and a receipt from the finace department to prove it. I have removed your comments because they are no longer true. Thank you for your concern.  Users/RealComputers
