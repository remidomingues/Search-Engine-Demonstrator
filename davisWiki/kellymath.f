20110509 16:24:51 nbsp Hi, and welcome to the wiki!  I saw the exchange that you had on the Friendly Cab page.  I was glad to see that you got a response from the owner that you were satisfied with.  I thought you should know that the other, more obnoxious response came from someone who works at another cab company in town, and that this person can be a bit of a jerk. Users/CovertProfessor

 Just in case youre not familiar with the expression, Han is saying its not worth engaging with, or feeding, Josh, who is the trolls troll.  You arent the troll. Like CP said, welcome to the wiki.  Thanks for sharing your experience; it sounds like it may be helpful to Bruce in improving customer relations. Users/TomGarberson

20110510 02:42:59 nbsp Do you want your user name to be kellymath or KellyMatheson as you had it before or do you want to change it to some slightly different capitalization perhaps?  We can consolidate into one page. Also thanks for your response to my reply. Users/BruceHansen
