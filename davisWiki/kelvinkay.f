20071026 08:22:52 nbsp Great photos, but please dont remove other peoples photos from the entry... you can add yours beside theirs.  In some cases you reshot the same angle with a better camera, so it makes sense, but in general theres no reason to remove somebody elses photo to add yours.  They are great photos, though.
