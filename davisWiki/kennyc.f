20090426 00:51:35 nbsp Unlike you, I actually went down to the county health department and figured out why Davis Sushi Buffet was closed. I actually have the incident report on my desk. And it was for a weekend, not an entire week. The only problem they had was with vector control. There were no problems with general cleanliness, food preparation, employee hygiene, etc. They just had a few cockroaches and needed to call the exterminator, something not unexpected for a restaurant in this region. Thus, Ive deleted your comment. Talk about your opinions of the restaurant all you like, but dont lie or exaggerate about the facts. Users/WilliamLewis
