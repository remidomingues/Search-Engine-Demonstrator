20080811 16:31:41 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. It looks like youre associated with The Drake. Its great youre getting involved with DavisWiki, but please dont delete or alter comments, especially on your business page. It reflects badly on your business and edits like that tend to get reverted pretty quickly. You might find Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner this page helpful.  Users/ElleWeber

I restored the reviews you deleted... but there are some suggestions that you might want to consider on the Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner community written guide for business owners.  You can read it by Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner clicking here.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
