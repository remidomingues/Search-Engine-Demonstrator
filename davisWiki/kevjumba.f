KevJumba (Kevin Wu) is one of the top YouTube comedy stars to date (no doubt, the top YouTube star in Davis.)

As an entering Art Major (now Communications Major) a part the UC Davis class of 2012, Kevin gained notoriety for his YouTube channel http://www.youtube.com/user/kevjumba which began during his high school years. It is said that much of Kevins humor is built around his Asian identity with his traditional Asian father playing a major role in his videos.

Kevin withdrew from UC Davis for one quarter (Fall 2010) to join his father on the 2010 season of Amazing Race, making him the second known UC Davis student to be on the show.

20101109 00:38:31 nbsp Kevjumba passed by me on his bike and gave me a dirty look for no reason when I made eye contact with him. He once walked into our Queer Studies class on accident, and when he found out it was Queer Studies he started acting real rude. : Users/ThUn
