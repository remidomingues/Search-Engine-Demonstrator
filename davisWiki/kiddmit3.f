kiddmit3
In a nut shell, kiddmit3 (aka lac attack, bboy uncle dave, or the now ancient sonic 2 ) is a current undergrad majoring in Biological Sciences.

From LA to Virginia Beach, VA, he dabbled in cross country, tennis, and bboying while in high school. In contrast, nowadays, Davis serves as purely a place of study that hopefully will be the starting grounds for his career in dentistry.

To some, he is also known as the descendant of an ancient dragon lord.

20101023 17:35:43 nbsp Yeah, I didnt think a page should be poorly represented by one users extensive bickering. Thanks for the welcome and heads up though, but I doubt anything will arise from my comment. Users/kiddmit3

20101024 10:39:35 nbsp Wikis are mutable and constantly edited.  That page wont stick around like that for the simple reason that its not a great page in that form.  Wikis are made up of the actions of lots of people, and lots of people tend to act like water, wearing down even mountains.  Its hard to keep something that is bad form up for the long term.  Eventually even the most stubborn granite gets smoothed over. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20111119 19:18:00 nbsp If the police were calling this an unlawful assembly, theyre wrong. An unlawful assembly is an assembly for the purpose of doing something unlawful. The administration has repeatedly claimed that they only wanted the tents gone.

 I am writing to tell you about events that occurred Friday afternoon at UC Davis relating to a group of protestors who chose to set up an encampment on the quad Thursday as part of a week of peaceful demonstrations on our campus that coincided with many other occupy movements at universities throughout the country.
 The group did not respond to requests from administration and campus police to comply with campus rules that exist to protect the health and safety of our campus community. The group was informed in writing this morning that the encampment violated regulations designed to protect the health and safety of students, staff and faculty.  The group was further informed that if they did not dismantle the encampment, it would have to be removed.
 Following our requests, several of the group chose to dismantle their tents this afternoon and we are grateful for their actions.  However a number of protestors refused our warning, offering us no option but to ask the police to assist in their removal.  We are saddened to report that during this activity, 10 protestors were arrested and pepper spray was used.  We will be reviewing the details of the incident.
