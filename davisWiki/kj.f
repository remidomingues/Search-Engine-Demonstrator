20070817 10:34:59 nbsp Howdy, Mr. or Ms. J, and Welcome to the Wiki.  It very much appears you are an employee of Superior Auto Body, so I deleted your comment (especially since you deleted a link to the rest of the auto places, something that is very questionable editing unless youre trying to vandalize the wiki).   If youre just made some well meaning edits, Im sorry about misunderstanding your intent; there are people who do that in a mistaken idea that it isnt horribly obvious to everybody.  Tell us a bit about yourself, and please consider the importance of using your realname.  What are you into, who are you... were a friendly community here, prone to Wiki Gatherings getting together, and because were local, much less anonymous than the world wide web.

20071016 05:02:04 nbsp Do not vandalize the wiki.  It is a small, petty and very very short road.  Got issues?  Share them here.  Otherwise, try to be a bit more constructive and less destructive. Users/JabberWokky
