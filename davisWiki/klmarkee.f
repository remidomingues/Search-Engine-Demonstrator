20100717 14:56:38 nbsp  Welcome to the Wiki. You got a http://daviswiki.org/Users/klmarkee?actionuserinfo history of edits that suggests that you are affiliated with Davisville Management Company, but you havent taken the time to introduce yourself (so you dont have any identity here yet other than your edit history) as a member of the community or use the wiki for anything other than to advertise things you have a financial interest in. This is a community wiki and to only use it for commercial purposes misses out on the wider benefits that it can offer to everyone in Davis.
I reverted http://daviswiki.org/Fountain_Circle_Townhomes?actiondiff&version247&version146 one of your recent edits because I felt that the information you removed resulted in damage to the page. You removed a valid question about the property and its name, historical information, parking information and then curiously a link back to the Apartments page. The removal of that link is interesting because the whole reason that there is any information about apartments in Davis on the wiki is to make it easier for people who are looking for one to rent to find the right one for them. When you remove that link back to the central list of apartments it makes me wonder if you want to try to hide the existence of other apartments from prospective tenants; but you left the link to the  Rental Housing Guide.
When I looked over your other edits I saw a pattern of fiddling with photos for apartment complexes that Davisville Management Company manages. You removed photos that other editors took the time to take, upload and add to the page. Why? One of the photos that you removed was a really nice one of the pool at Almondwood Apartments that was taken by Users/TusharRawat. In other cases youve just move the photo to the left of the quick information table; moving the photo to the left like that can cause problems for browsers and deviates from the established apartment listing template.
I really dont like writing these welcome to the wiki message anymore because I have no idea if people ever read them, so when I see them engage in the same behaviors that have been pointed out to them in the past I cant tell if they are ignoring the outreach of other editors or if they just didnt get the message because they didnt check their page when the little yellow flag in the upper right hand corner turned on.
My question for you is are you going to be a member of the community (both the Wiki Community and the Davis Community, because the two arent that separate) and treat the wiki like a community resource, or are you going to only come here to edit pages when it is in your financial interest to do so? Users/JasonAller

20100718 00:06:47 nbsp I concur wholeheartedly with the above statement Users/StevenDaubert

20101204 10:22:02 nbsp Why are you deleting other users comments? Users/TomGarberson

20101204 12:21:38 nbsp Moreover, why are you making fake accounts to leave fake reviews on apartment pages? Users/TomGarberson

20101204 12:23:53 nbsp ...and just generally be an Users/Donkey ass? Users/JoePomidor

20101204 13:27:28 nbsp Accounts like this one (and Users/Donkey associated accounts) are what caused me to stop seeing Davis Wiki as a community wiki. The wiki community needs to decide how it is going to handle Identity/Abuse abuse of Wiki Community/Organizational accounts/Abuse all sorts. Once the community decides on a course of action it may still not be a place I feel like spending my time and talent. If the wiki community does nothing pretty soon there wont be a wiki community left.

The other problem with deciding on a course of action is tied to the limitations of the current software that Davis Wiki runs on. Neither Users/PhilipNeustrom Philip or Users/MikeIvanov Mike have engaged in public discussion about the philosophies behind the new wiki software they http://localwiki.org/ are writing. Software has a major influence on how the community interacts; a small example noted above is that the you have a message flag is too easy to overlook and as a result it makes it frustrating to put energy into outreach with new editors, only to be ignored. The example is trivial to fix in the new version of the software, but there are more complex issues like charting out the process by which a new user registers and is integrated into the community that are far more complex and tied into the design of the software in ways that may make it hard or impossible to change.

klmarkee represents a failure of the current combination of software and community; would they also be a failure in the next combination of software and community? Users/JasonAller
  Found this randomly and thought I should respond.  Without going into too much detail now, there will be a time when the discussion about the new software will happen, but it wouldnt be as productive to have that discussion without looking at some concrete, working prototypes.  For now we are mindful of not embedding any controversial decisions into the software in ways that will be hard or impossible to change, as was the case with MoinMoin/Sycamore.  Briefly, what allows for this is the approach of splitting the software up into several apps, which can be modified/customized/swapped independently of the other apps (i.e., identity management, revision tracking, etc).
