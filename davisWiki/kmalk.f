Welcome to the Wiki Howdy, Mr. or Ms. Malk, and Welcome to the Wiki!   You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you (or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here).  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!

You appear to be deleting entries off the Davis Wiki with no replacement.  Luckily I also happen to edit the neighboring Wiki Spot wiki, which is where you have accidentally put the replacements.  If you want those entries to be seen by people in Davis, it might be a good idea to move them here to the Davis Wiki... I dont think people in Germany care much about that business.  :)  Seriously, however, thanks for trying to clean up the mistakes and confusion regarding what is where and the name of the business.

Oh, and you might want to read the Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner wiki guide for business owners to get a feel for what works well here.  Also, dont forget that youre a member of the community too, so feel free to poke around and help out with Front Page the rest of the wiki.  Welcome to the Wiki!
