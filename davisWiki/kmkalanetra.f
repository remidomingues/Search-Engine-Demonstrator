My names Evan, pleased to meet you.  One of the nice things about a cooperative effort like the wiki is... well... the cooperation!  Some of the layout stuff can be fairly difficult to pick up for new editors, but there are plenty of people willing to help out.  Welcome to the wiki! Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
