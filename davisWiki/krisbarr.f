Dear Krisbarr,

Id like to apologize for the Pad Thai that you got from us . Normally, if the customer cannot handle the food that is so spicy, we are happy to fix it or remake it until the customer are happy. In this case Id like to give you a credit from us so please give us a chance to made up something for you. Really hope that you will come back here again.
