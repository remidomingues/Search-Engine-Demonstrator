Welcome to the Wiki Howdy, Mr. or Ms. Place, and Welcome to the Wiki!   You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you (or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here).  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for adding the links to the Illegal Immigration Capture the Flag, but it appears to me to be spam... especially since you are adding it on other Wiki Spot wikis under a different name.  Thats being a bad neighbor... at the very minimum you arent introducing yourself as who you are.  Please just use the one account  it will work across all the Wiki Spot sites, and consider if your contribution is relevant to the community who has created the wiki and fits with their local traditions and conventions regarding content.  Youre more than welcome to contribute... but right now it appears (to me at least) that you were spamming.  If not, by all means, let us know, and well help you find a good place for the link.
