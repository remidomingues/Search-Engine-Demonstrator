Hi there, and Welcome to the Wiki. I saw http://daviswiki.org/Users/RichLindvall?actiondiff&version2151&version1150 your edit on Richs page, and thought Id leave this note for you.  On the wiki, were all considered equal editors. If someone adds something you dont like, you can edit it!  Or respond to it, or do whatever you like :)   If people disagree about a set of changes, we use a /talk page to get input from the general community and try to figure out a consensus answer.  Itd be great if you stick around and contribute to this community resource. Have any favorite restaurants or parks? Users/Edwins ES

20090618 21:06:49 nbsp Thanks for your comment on my user page.  When we left GVCC we didnt know anyone else locally whod left so we felt pretty LONELY...  My main reason for putting your name and others on the Recovering page was to create a lifeline of folks who might be able to minister to others who have left or are considering leaving.  Sorry you felt outed.   Users/RichLindvall
