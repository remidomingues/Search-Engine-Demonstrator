Hey there.  I reverted your change on Eastlake Apartments because the formatting was off.  Can you: 1) Upload the images to the Davis Wiki rather than link to an external image site (see Help with images) 2) Consider the importance of using your realname when using the Davis Wiki.

Also, I removed some of your superpromotional language with bold and lots of !!!!.  Please rewrite the material to be informational, not promotional!  Thanks & welcome!  Users/PhilipNeustrom

  Your edits looked like they might be coming from a competitor to Eastlake Apartments that was trying to damage their business. Close this account, reregister under your real name, establish some identity and ask for help learning how to edit. Users/JasonAller

20100520 16:52:03 nbsp You can check the history of changes on a page by clicking on the info button at the top (just below Recent Changes) for that page.  It http://daviswiki.org/Eastlake_Apartments?actioninfo looks like Users/JasonAller reverted your changes.  Have a look back at the Help with Images link that Philip linked, above.  Theres info there for making the images thumbnails (I recommend about a 300400 thumbnail size).  Make sure youre placing them in the right place on the page.  It looked like you placed all of your additions to the page in the middle of the info table for the apartment.  Ill touch it up a little bit in a moment, and you can see what you think.
