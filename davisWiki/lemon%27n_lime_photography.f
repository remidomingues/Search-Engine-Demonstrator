TJ has always been drawn to capturing peoples essence (and even yummy cupcakes!) in her photography sessions.  As a mom, she understands the beauty of what we see in our loved ones, especially our children.  As an educator, she is patient and creative, often capturing those it moments that can happen in a spur of the moment.  TJ’s portrait sessions typically do not have a time limit (usually 1 ~ 2 hours), therefore allowing her clients to relax and enjoy the entire experience.

20090705 16:57:47 nbsp TJ was a photographer at my wedding in Bakersfield, CA in November 2007 (before she moved to Davis).  She did a wonderful job catching precious memories and also photographing the scenery and decorations.  I loved how she was able to change the look of some of the pictures with her comptuter as well.  TJ will do whatever is asked of her and then some to ensure the photos she is taking will be exactly what her clients ordered!  I absolutely recommend Lemonn lime Photography! Users/sarahyatt
