Hey, dont worry about other people disagreeing with your opinions.  If we all had the same opinions, the world would be a boring place... on the other hand, some people feel personally attacked if you dislike or have had a bad experience with their thing.  Its just human nature... they ascribe to malice that which is a mere statement of opinion and experience.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
