re: outdoor davis image.  The reason its being deleted is that its and advertisement for the store and not much more.

We dont generally allow overt advertising (for commercial businesses) like that on the wiki.  Is there a way you could convey the information expressed in the advertisement in informational, nonpromotional language?  If so, I doubt someone will remove that addition from the page.  Perhaps a link to a sales page on your business website?

We realize theres confusion around some of this stuff you should check out Welcome to the wiki/business owner.  Users/PhilipNeustrom

20100403 16:54:54 nbsp Considering that you are not willing to stand behind your words with your real name and that you have given every indication that you are only here for your own commercial interests I cant say Im inclinded to take any of your suggestions seriously. This wiki is a community resource, not an advertising venue. The history of edits made to Outdoor Davis is pretty questionable to the point where I wonder how many accounts youve used prior to this one. In the past I probably would been the first to Welcome to the Wiki welcome you to the wiki, but frankly Ive grown tired of reaching out to editors who ignore all the good advice on the wiki about how to make this a positive experience for both themselves and the rest of the Wiki Community.
