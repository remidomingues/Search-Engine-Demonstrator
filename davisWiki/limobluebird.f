Hey, I moved the entry about the company Bluebird here so it was more visible.  Welcome to the Wiki!  You probably want to create an account under your name (first is fine, although many use their full name), because editing as a company is kind of frowned upon (who knows who is behind the account?!?!).  Glad to have you here.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, jw.dw@timewarp.org
