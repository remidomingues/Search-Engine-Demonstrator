Home based business: Liz Wise Bookkeeping



20071215 09:29:07 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. The content you were working with on the Templates/Business page has been moved to a Liz Wise Bookkeeping. During those moves the content was edited a little to help it fit the mold of other business listings. Feel free to make corrections if any of those edits caused the content to be misrepresented. You may want to read Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner as it has a lot of good information. Users/JasonAller

20091015 13:24:42 nbsp Hi, Liz.  I moved the content from the generic page (create a new page with this title) to this page, which is your personal user page. I also fixed the link for your photo and reduced its size and made other small changes to the Liz Wise Bookkeeping business page. More info is available for you on the Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner and How to Edit pages. Cheers. Users/robinlaughlin

20100311 09:39:37 nbsp Hi Liz.  The wiki is actually not allowed to be used for advertising because of its 501(c)(3) nonprofit status.  Business pages, such as Liz Wise Bookkeeping, are intended to be about the business, information in nature, rather than advertising.  The page reads as an advertisement, and will need to be cleaned up dramatically.  Please have a look at the Wiki Community/For Profit Restrictions forprofit restrictions page for details.

20100729 08:35:20 nbsp Hi again Liz.  The Liz Wise Bookkeeping page is looking more and more promotional again.  Please be sure to look around the business owner page (linked twice above).  Using segments of all caps is frowned upon, and a wiki page about a business really isnt the place to post a resume or a flyer.  The page is supposed to inform users about the page from the perspective of the Davis community.  This page, on the other hand, would be a perfect place to put stuff like your employment history, if thats what you want to do.  Id be happy to help you work on the bookkeeping page, but itd really help to get a response from you to know that you recognize these issues. Users/TomGarberson

20100729 18:02:42 nbsp Hi there Liz, Please remember to Preview.  Ive edited the entry on your business.  Please dont take the edits the wrong way, you are welcome to edit it some more to be more to your liking.  But if youll take a look around at other business pages, I think youll see that for the most part they are written in a similar tone to how it is now.  Consistency is important in maintaining a topnotch resource for Davis, and I think the Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner page will give you a lot of insight into why.  If you have concerns, you can leave me a comment (or any number of my fellow editors), or get my contact information from my user page.   Users/MasonMurray
