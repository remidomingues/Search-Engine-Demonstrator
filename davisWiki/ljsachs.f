My name is Louis Jacob Sachs


I am a recent graduate from UC Davis with a degree in Religious Studies. I am a Brother of Alpha Epsilon Pi (the only Jewish Fraternity in North America) and other than that I work, I write papers, and I like to relax.

I am living in Israel for the year studying in Jerusalem at the Pardes Institute of Jewish Studies.

Also I has a roommate named Perry Schwartz, he is also a graduate. We told each other stories before we went to sleep at night. Perry has lots of funny voices. He makes me smile. :)
