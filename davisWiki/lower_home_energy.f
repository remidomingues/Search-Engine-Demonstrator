As a home owner it is important for you to understand that your home is built as an operable system. If one component fails others may have to work harder to provide you with the comfort you deserve. This could decrease the longevity of your equipment and cost you more money later. At Lower Home Energy we pride ourselves with the success of providing energy efficient opportunities to reduce your carbon footprint and also lower your homes energy consumption. Every home is unique and together we can find out what is needed for your home.

Do you want your home to be more energy efficient?

Do you want to know if your home has levels of carbon monoxide that exceed the standard limits?

Do you want to know what energy efficiency measures you should do first?

These are some questions that you should know about the home you are buying or the home you own. If you are ready to make these changes for a greener life then a home energy audit is the first step.

A home energy audit will focus on the health, safety, and efficiency of your home. We will conduct several testing measures to provide you with a complete report, and guideline to making your home become more energy efficient. Rising utility costs, growing demand for energy efficiency with potential home buyers, concerns about the environment and economic uncertainty have led to billions of dollars in federal, state and local programs. Now is the time to act and make it more affordable to live comfortable in your home through energy conservation.

This will provide you with a step by step approach so you can understand how your home uses energy and to view your home as a system.
