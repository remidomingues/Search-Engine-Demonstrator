20100216 16:15:49 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy Mr. or Ms. House (possibly Dr. House?), and Welcome to the Wiki!   You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you.  Or not: its your choice, but honestly, this isnt a business listing site, its a community site more like a public park.  Do you introduce yourself to people you meet while walking through a park as Hi, Im Luxuryouthouse?  Its a fairly common mistake (although youll note that when you signed up, it asked you not to use your business name), but it is kind of rude and antisocial given the nature of the wiki.  My names Evan, pleased to meet you.  Thanks for the edits you made, and I encourage you to reregister and introduce yourself under your own identity rather than the kind of offputting odd act of I use my business name when I talk to my neighbors.  Either way, if you have any questions, just ask... were a friendly group here, and once again, welcome to the wiki! Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
