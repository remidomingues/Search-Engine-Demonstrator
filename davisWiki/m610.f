Mike Meier (m610)
Residence
Davis resident from 197991 and 1993present.

What I Used to Do
Mostlyretired from UCD where I taught Materials Science and Engineering materials science courses, developed the laboratory teaching program, and developed the materials characterization facility (light and electron microscopes, xray analysis and imaging, etc.) in the Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science.

What I Do Now
Im currently working on a software project for use with (race) track videos and similar activities, some book projects, and art projects exploring the relationships between art and science.

Hobbies and Interests
  Hiking and camping, especially in the Mono Lake and Tioga Pass areas.
  Digital photography.  I used to do film, and my old Minolta camera even still has film in it, and has, since about 1998.
  Digital Videos, I have gotten reasonably good at this and have some interesting projects in mind.
  Bicycling, I used to do a lot of this (NC to CO many years ago, lots of Davis Double Century Davis DoubleCenturies and lots more centuries) and am just now getting back into it.  DDC in 2008?
  Programming, mostly in Delphi.  Completed projects that other people actually use include a Jominy Endquench data analysis program, grain size and volume fraction measuring programs, and an instrument usage logging program.
  Computers, I learned hardware and software by building my own computers back when CP/M was still a viable operating system.  One result of this was a small collection of old computers, including an Epson QX10, Kaypro 10, and two S100 systems, and a case of 8 floppy disks, all in working condition.
  Davis Motorsports Club Motorsports, with an emphasis on driving rather than watching, although I do attend some of the races held in California.  As for driving, Ive autocrossed a little and I have driven at track days a lot, some 40 events, and I instruct new drivers at these events.  I drive a 1998 Honda Prelude and the car is modified somewhat to improve handling and safety, but so far not power (it still gets over 29 mpg highway), and it is wired for video.  A selection of my track videos have been uploaded to http://videos.streetfire.net/videos/search/m610/page_1.htm StreetFire.

20071119 15:10:55 nbsp The Downtown II idea is really interesting, but Ive seen it kill a downtown in the past.  West Palm Beach in Florida did something similar for very similar reasons... a very very well done project executed in slowly rolled out phases over a couple decades, but it wound up killing both downtowns (in part due to a horrific rebuild of subroad infrastructure that tore up the roads over a year longer than intended).  Of course, now the real estate is there, the parking, mass transit and sidewalks are there, and what is now empty could revitalize over decades into a wonderful huge downtown area, but in the near term it really did a doozy on the local music, farmers market and other aspects of downtown life prior to the project.  It almost worked (and there are some great things like a center for the performing arts that came out of it), but the loss was tragic. Users/JabberWokky

20080224 17:26:24 nbsp I think there is general interest in video... the actual place to discuss this would be wiki:sycamore the Sycamore Wiki, where development of the software goes on.  My wiki software does support video, and Ive discovered that the conversion process is horribly CPU intensive for a web server, even for limited size clips.  Hosting elsewhere is a possibility, but then that wiki community wouldnt have all their content in their backups.  Given the dual nature (technical/practical) of the issue, bringing it up at the wiki:wikispot Wiki Spot wiki for general discussion might be a good idea as well. Users/JabberWokky

20080622 21:30:37 nbsp Hey, Mike hows it going? I agree. Maybe I need to try harder to be a little more creative. I hope life outside UCD is treating you well. I really appreciated you taking me in for that one summer. Maybe I could have been more helpful, but I certainly learned a lot of practical know how and cannibalizing that old electron microscope was a whole lot of fun. Users/MikeMele
