I am Ronald Payne and I keep losing my passwords on my accounts.  I am a roommate of Steve.



20070926 08:40:39 nbsp Howdy, Mr. or Ms. Payne.  It appears you are editing from the same computer as, or are in fact Steve Ostrowski.  Could you please introduce yourself?  Steves a good guy, but his editing here on the wiki was unfortunately rather unilateral, and hes the only person from Davis ever banned from editing the wiki.  I apologize for the suspicion, but Steve has used fake accounts before, and this account certainly looks questionable.  Introduce yourself... wed love to welcome any new editors, but it regrettably appears right now that this account is being used to subvert Steves ban on editing.  Users/JabberWokky
