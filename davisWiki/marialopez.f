20090912 21:26:27 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy Maria, and Welcome to the Wiki!    My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  I noticed that you deleted the entry that documents the Davis business A Better Place to Bead, and it looks as if you mistook the wiki to be a business listing site.  The Davis Wiki is a community effort to document all the wonderful, historical (and even some of the tragic) aspects of Davis, from World War II to the founding of the University Farm to Town Art (including the Cheshire Cat Discharge whimsical pieces), to information about the history of trash pickup!  It is a volunteer effort by the community of Davis to create a resource of what makes up  the community of Davis.  Im wondering why you deleted the entry about A Better Place to Bead.  If it has recently closed, there are many departed businesses listed here (if you remember any, please add one!), so if that is the case, simply note on the entry that it has closed.  If not, why did you delete it? Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
