20100724 07:39:43 nbsp Hi maritovar, and Welcome to the Wiki!  I see you recently deleted some information from the Angies Beauty Salon page.  You also tried to direct customers to a competitor, Expressions Hair Design.  You are not the first person to do this recently.  I dont know if you are associated with Expressions Hair Design, but when you do things like this it makes the business look bad.  From one wiki editor to another, I would ask you not to do things like this in the future.  The wiki is meant to be a resource for the community, and by deleting content or favoring one business over another, you make it less valuable. Users/CovertProfessor
