Mike Matiasek

Image(mikesniffingbeer.jpg, 425, right, thumbnail, Mike enjoying a matrimonial ale at his wedding, June 2010) Mike Matiasek graduated with a Ph.D. in Microbiology in 2012 from the Scow Microbial Ecology Lab at the University of California at Davis. During his time in Davis he was a passionate hop grower at the EC garden with the Merry Growlers of Davis. He was also the Vice President of the Greenbelt Brewers Association.
In 2012 he left Davis and moved to Chico, CA where he is a Microbiology Instructor at http://www.butte.edu/, Butte College. He sorely misses the wiki community in Davis and hopes to inspire Chicoites to improve the http://chicowiki.org/, chicowiki.


Mike Matiasek is a very accomplished home brewer.  He has won several well deserved awards for his brews.  I do my part and help him drink them.  Users/DagonJones

20090407 18:32:45 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. Those Photography photos you added to the Experimental College Community Garden page of hops are great. Where were they taken? Out by Sloughhouse, or up by Hopland? Users/JasonAller

20090408 09:39:32 nbsp Just FYI, not all the images on Wikipedia are free. One of the ones you put on here was ccby, which allows use if that use is attributed. I added the attribution for you so that we comply with the terms of the license. The other image you posted is licensed under the GDFL, which really isnt free in any sense, despite what the Free Software Foundation would claim. Yeah, I know that the world of copyright and licenses is screwed up. :\ Users/WilliamLewis

20090408 11:01:22 nbsp Hi Mike!  Ive gone ahead and merged the How to grow your own hops article with the Merry Growlers of Davis page.  Theres also still the Growing Hops article for general information about hops.  Im looking forward to hearing about your experiences... Ive thought about growing hops, too, but have never got around to it. Users/JonathanLawton

20090408 23:05:38 nbsp Youre quite welcome!  I was thinking about renaming the Growing Hops page, too... your suggestion convinced me. ;) Users/JonathanLawton

20090410 12:59:31 nbsp Uh oh. If your hops planting is where I think it is, then it may well be blocking solar access for a person who has gardened the same plot for nearly 30 years. Why wasnt she notified of this before it was built? Users/BarbaraKing

20090413 17:13:39 nbsp The hopyard doesnt affect the solar access for those garden plots, as the shadow is cast upon the trail and not the plot space.  Users/TimQuick

20090607 23:54:46 nbsp I am not a brewer, but take an interest in plant related things, especially when involving my utmost favorite beverage. It seems as though grapes are easy enough to grow and have, but you dont see hops around as much and I think its awesome youre growing some!! I really look forward to pictures on your progress.  Users/ChristyMarsden

20091113 09:35:47 nbsp Looking at your picobrewery, I dont see how you do mashing or your boil. Then again, Im a brewing n00b. Whats your process with that setup? Users/WilliamLewis

20100928 08:57:44 nbsp If you highlight a segment and bold it twice the bold will be inverted or undone, so I just went through the page and removed all bold markers.  Then selected only the stuff you wanted bolded and that seemed to do the trick. Users/DagonJones

20110201 07:26:26 nbsp So how did the Mt. Hood hops do in their first year? Im thinking of growing them in Sacramento, and Im wondering how they deal with the Valley heat in the summer? Users/MattJurach

20110317 11:59:30 nbsp Mt Hoods Only did ok, but with only one season to reference I am hopeful they will pick up this season! They certainly did not perform like cascades did in their first yeat, the gold standard as far as I can tell. I think we harvested 11.5 pounds of Mt hoods from 6 plants. In cascades first year, I got about that much from each plant! You a brewer I presume? You should come check out the Greenbelt brewers if you are interested in a homebrew club. Users/matiasek

20110715 12:21:15 nbsp Hows that Cascade pale?  You guys continuing to get massive crops of the Cascades?  It was pretty cool checking out the first harvest last summer. Users/TomGarberson
