 math: 21abcd (calc and vector analysis), 22ab (linear alg and diff equations), 25 (advanced calc), 108 (proofs), 118ab (PDEs), 119ab (ODEs, b is fun), 125ab (real analysis), 128bc (numerical analysis), 141 (geometry, fun class), 145 (combinatorics), 167 (linear algebra), 199 (research), 194H (senior thesis)
 statistics: 13 (plug & chug stats), 131a (probability, important class for any scientist, including social scientists, if worried about the difficulty take 130a which is the same stuff but less mathy)
 physics: 9a (physics can be fun)
 computer science: 10 (good intro to programming for those with no experience), 30 (tons of work with Davis, but youll learn a lot)
 engineering: 6 (matlab)
 chemistry: 2a (Dr. E is a good teacher but the subject matter is a little dry)
 biology: 1bc, 132 (if you are a bio major and you liked calculus, you will love this class, plus Dr. Hom is amazing)
 evolution & ecology: 100 (evolution),101 (enjoyable), 198 (CLIMB research. I loved it)
 entomology: 104 (behavioral ecology of insects), 116 (aquatic insect biology)
 environmental science: 121 (intro to mathematical ecology. Really fun class for biology and math majors)
 sociology: 1, 3 (these were interesting courses but a little repetitive)
 anthropology: 2 (This class would be interesting for someone with little exposure to sociology or philosophy, but the professor I got went way too slow.
 philosophy: 1, 14 (philosophy of contemporary problems/issues, interesting class)
 english: 1 (currently UWP, standard essay writing stuff)
 exercise biology: 10 (fun class, you learn a lot about exercise from a very simplified scientific perspective)
 nutrition: 10 (helps defunct some of those nutrition myths for your)
 psychology: 1 (All i remember is that i liked the class)
