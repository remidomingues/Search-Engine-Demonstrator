20081113 15:30:37 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy Matt, and Welcome to the Wiki!   My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for the review of Dos Coyotes, but you should probably know that they dont serve Mexican or TexMex, they serve Southwestern, which is a cultural lineage of the old chuck wagons, not Mexico.  Similar, as it was influenced by Mexican cuisine, but distinct.  Either way, if you dont like it, you dont like it, so Im not exactly defending them, just pointing out the difference.  :)  Once again, welcome to the wiki!
