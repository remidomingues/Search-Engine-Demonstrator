I came to Davis for the WESTCO conference the weekend of April 2 and Stayed at the Domes, the Coops are amazing here, the gardening and farm rojects are really impressive.
I stayed for a week and made some awesome friends, you may have seen me riding a tallbike, climbing trees or running around with 3x5 notecards, making texture rubbings with crayons on the bus, on campus, Delta of Venus, and diisplaying them at the Farmers Market along with the rest of the art cards Ive been collecting and sharing for the past few years.
I went to the Davis Feminist Film Festival and some anonymous guy gave me ten bucks to get in the second day after I spent my last ten bucks getting in the day before.  Thank you whoever you are.  The DFFF was amazing and the last one about Ann Murray Paige and the breast cancer diaries made me cry.  It felt really good to cry because Ive been holding it back for a while now.  It was a really good way to spend my last night in Davis.  Im from Roseburg, Oregon and I love communities that give a rats ass.  I had a great time visiting Davis and I want to come back and work on bikes at Bike Forth, and explore other community projects that are going on in this town.

I also have a website
maxmoot.com

I try to post cards and other projects Im doing, it is a work in progress and I am open to recieving feedback and input for the website as well as all of your old flash cards.  Please send me any cards you may have that would otherwise go into a recycling bin or garbage so that I can reuse them.

for contact, email maxdolfsmoot@gmail.com

thanks for a wonderful time in Davis
