i was under the impression that the wiki was a site for democratic exchange, however, all postings i have contrived in the last/first 5 minutes of participating in this community have been grossly edited as they were not, for example, cheerleading the virtues of davis nightlife. where can one find a site that actually serves as a forum open to the opinions of citizens with a voice that longs to be heard and can indeed, even if through criticism, contribute to the community at large? apparently, not in america where censorship is swift, strict, and covert.


Hey, the Little Prague page already says that.  Welcome to the Wiki, though.   Users/BrentLaabs

20070906 00:12:28 nbsp In regard to your comment about your initial edits being reverted... The wiki is not a free for all, there are certain established customs that have emerged over time. Your edits were off topic for the pages that they were added to (Events Board and Front Page). Stick around. Collaborative editing takes a little getting used to because it involves working with people that you cant see and interact with directly. Users/JasonAller

20070906 00:51:56 nbsp The wiki is a community, and you happened to make some beginner mistakes (the equivelent of peeing in a closet, mistaking it for a bathroom).  It was cleaned up, but believe me, you can certainly rail against Davis... there are I Hate Davis entire entries devoted to it.  Poke around... youll get the idea. Users/JabberWokky

20070906 00:54:44 nbsp By the way, it might be a good idea to introduce yourself.  Whats your name, what are you into, what do you like/dislike in town?  Im Evan Edwards, but my wife (and others) call me Wokky. Users/JabberWokky
