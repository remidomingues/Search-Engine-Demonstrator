Welcome to the Wiki Howdy,  Mr. or Ms. What, and Welcome to the Wiki!   You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you (or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here).  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for updating the Christian Science summary... if you know much about their beliefs (and it sounds like you would), feel free to edit the paragraph that is there to make it more accurate.  Thats how the wiki grows and corrects itself: people putting what they know out there, and others who might know a bit more about it adding their knowledge to the whole.  Once again, welcome!
