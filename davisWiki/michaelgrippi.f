20110426 13:29:27 nbsp I like the new photo on Yoga Bear PC Repair! Users/TomGarberson

20110426 14:39:48 nbsp Cool photo!  You might want to give Jeff Perry and the Aggie credit, however (Im assuming you asked for permission).  You can add credit in a caption by just adding it to the image tag like this: {{{Image(photo.jpg, This is the caption)}}} Users/JabberWokky

20110427 15:05:31 nbsp Hi Michael! You may have noticed that users/CovertProfessor someone removed the price comparison you made on the Computer Repair page, and that users/masonmurray someone else removed it again.  Thats because in order to keep our nonprofit status, we cant have anything reading like an advertisement.  Having your prices listed as a comparison like that is pretty much advertising.   Users/MasonMurray

20110427 15:40:49 nbsp What Mason said.  Although its worth noting that something like the TuneUp and Flat repair chart on the Bicycle Shops page, thats a purely informational comparison, would probably be very useful and nonpromotional.  If someone wanted to collect information from most or all of the computer repair places in town and do a list for a given service, that could be pretty useful. Users/TomGarberson

20110427 16:53:19 nbsp Got your email and added the photo credit. Users/JabberWokky

20110428 12:17:16 nbsp Youre welcome to try and see how the other editors take it. If you ask me, its all in the presentation.  If it looks like youre trying to one up the other repair shops on that page it probably wont stay.  If your photo just makes the page a little less bland it should be fine.   Users/MasonMurray
