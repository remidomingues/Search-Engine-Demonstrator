I saw your review on Red Orchid. I was wondering which restaurants you recommend in Chinatown SF. I work a few blocks from there every week but Ive only eaten at RG lounge and the Golden Star pho place... which isnt chinese. My coworker says everything else in Chinatown sucks compared to other places in SF...  Users/KellyM

20090511 13:05:10 nbsp Ive been to a number of Vietnamese restaurants in the San Jose area and agree that they are very good.  But I think that Sunrise is close.  Maybe you caught them on an off night?  I havent been to Bac Hoa Viet  Ive heard so many bad things about them that Ive just stayed away altogether! Users/CovertProfessor

20090512 20:10:24 nbsp Id love a name recommendation, if it isnt too much trouble to look up. Im only in SF once a week so I dont like to risk bad meals. Users/KellyM
