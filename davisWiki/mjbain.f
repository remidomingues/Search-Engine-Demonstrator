20081120 18:27:09 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy Melissa, and Welcome to the Wiki!    My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for the edit to the Superdog Inc. Better Dog Training entry.  I undid your changes, but not because I disagree with you... just that you were altering somebody elses words.  A much better method would be to add a new comment replying to the person and pointing out that you guys dont recommend him.  A brief comment as to why (or other ones you might recommend) would be helpful too.  Thank you so much for trying to clarify the situation, its just that attributed reviews are the direct words of somebody, and its generally a wiki faux pas to change somebody elses words.  Welcome to the wiki, and I hope you stick around and add your professional perspective... we are big supporters of dogs and other animals around here! Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20081120 15:57:12 nbsp Thank you....I didnt realize that.  Should I put it back to what I remember it saying?

Again, Im sorry. Users/mjbain

20081120 15:58:35 nbsp Looks like you put it back up.  I will edit my statement (or add another one) as to why we dont recommend him. Users/mjbain

   No need to be sorry... every editor starts out new at this.  It is not a big deal, and on wikis it is very easy to restore anything added or deleted.  I already did so, so you dont have to worry about it.  Also, keep in mind that you should feel free to edit the actual entries themselves (not just add comments).  You can do so by clicking the Edit icon at the top of any wiki page.  For instance, you can add the link you gave to the main body of the entry.  Everything on the entire wiki was written and is edited by people like you.  The other thing thats nice about collaborative editing is that you dont have to worry so much about formatting at first: if you just put up the information youre adding, somebody else more familiar with the technical details will add bullets, headers and links.  Were friendly and work together.  Everybody adds their own little corner of knowledge about Davis and the sum result so far is what comprises the wiki.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20091113 16:44:32 nbsp I saw http://daviswiki.org/Dogs?actiondiff&version2232&version1231 your edit on the Dogs page.  Are you closer to understanding why it is that some dogs eat grass? Users/CovertProfessor
