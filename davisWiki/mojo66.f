20081008 09:03:42 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy Ms. or Mr. Mojo, and Welcome to the Wiki!   You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you (or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here).  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for adding your recent reviews.  You dont have to censor yourself: shit is part of the English language.  Of course, everybody from children to seniors use the wiki, so you might want to consider what language youd use in line for a movie with a wide range of different types of people around you.  Its up to you, of course.  But theres no filter on the wiki for language.  Also, if you want to retract a comment (like on the Safeway entry), you can just hit the Edit button and edit the entry to remove your earlier comment (or edit anything about the entry itself).  If you have any questions, just ask, and once again, welcome to the wiki! Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
