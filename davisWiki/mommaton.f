20110523 11:12:52 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki!  Thanks for adding the new photos!  It looks like youre probably an employee/manager at Fountain Circle.  Why not take a moment to introduce yourself here on your user page?  Please also take a minute to read over Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner.  Theres a lot of valuable information there.

20110523 14:21:27 nbsp Howdy! I changed your last revision back to the previous version, because the wiki generally frowns upon promotional language. Also, theres no rule about impartial language, so a little bit of commentary adds local flavor to the wiki. Feel free to ask any of the editors (Tom, Users/Jabberwokky, Users/JoePomidor me, etc.) if you have any questions, and I also strongly advise you take a look at the Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner page.
