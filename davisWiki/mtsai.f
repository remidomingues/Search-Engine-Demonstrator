Hello all (:

Kidding about the grad part. I decided to stay for another year at UCD. Wheres the fun in graduating in three years anyway?


20100617 19:51:10 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. How about introducing yourself? It helps to establish a sense of community around here when people do. Users/JasonAller

20100618 10:11:24 nbsp So, has Davis Life Magazine done an article on the Davis Wiki yet? Users/CovertProfessor

20100621 06:36:57 nbsp I removed the link from Bank Robberies because: 1) the format you used broke the TableOfContents macro and 2) the story had no link to Davis Wiki. Serioiusly it would have been good to add a for more information about Bank Robberies in Davis see Davis Wiki line at the end of that story. Without such links back to the Wiki the media sections start to look like spam. It didnt help that I just removed some real spam right before removing your edit, as the parallels between what you and the spammer added were pretty close. They added a link to the Board of Education page about essay writing. Users/JasonAller

20100621 14:36:18 nbsp Hi Jason. First of all, I apologize for my mistake. I will make sure to triple check my edits from now on. And secondly, I cant help but feel like you are insinuating that I am the spammer. Is that the case? Users/mtsai
  I dont want to put words in JAs mouth, but it seems to me as though he is saying that your actions are indistinguishable from the spammers, not that you are the same person who put the spam up on the Board of Education page.  Frankly, I feel the same way.  I see these DLM links pop up everywhere and they just seem like ways to draw more attention to DLM, not real contributions to the wiki, and I resent that.  Thats why I asked whether youd done an article on the Davis Wiki.  Or, JAs suggestion to link back to us is also a good one.  Or, do you feel as though this is just a public resource for you to take advantage of without giving back to it?  Because again, thats what it looks like to me.   Users/CovertProfessor

20100621 14:56:05 nbsp Hey Jason, I just wanted to clarify that the story you were referring to was the link that I posted. I dont personally write the blogs and it was a few months back but Ill suggest linking back to Davis Wiki to the editor. And what do you recommend me doing instead of just randomly inserting media sections then (other than, of course, referring back to Davis Wiki). Users/mtsai

20100728 13:49:15 nbsp Hi mtsai.  I just discovered that 179 pages on the wiki currently have links to DLMs website or DLM email addresses.  I cant speak for anyone else, but I have a serious problem with this situation.  Per the wikis agreement with the IRS, it cannot be used as a promotional venue for forprofit organizations.  Even if that werent true, I personally have issues with it being used as a feeder for a forprofit website.  Ive started a Talk page to discuss this issue over at Davis Life Magazine/Talk, and your input as a representative (apparently) for DLM would be valuable. Users/TomGarberson
