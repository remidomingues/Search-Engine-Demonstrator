20120910 14:46:58 nbsp Hi Amy.  I just wanted to let you know that restaurant.com has been doing this with a lot of businesses.  I have seen multiple reports of their selling these passes without permission.  It may be that the first one caught someone off guard who didnt know it wasnt valid, or it could be Namaste, idk.  I just know Ive heard of this happening at other places.  Sorry that sucks though! Users/OliviaY
