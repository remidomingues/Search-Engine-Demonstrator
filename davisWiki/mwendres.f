20100428 00:02:15 nbsp Are you Users/dummyprofile? If so, why did you feel the need to create a second account? Users/WilliamLewis

20100428 00:07:59 nbsp You left comments and tried to make it look like they were left by other people. That isnt ok on the wiki. Please read Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner. Users/JasonAller

20100430 19:18:00 nbsp Greetings William Lewis,  Thank you for your quick response.  I was trying to figure out how to instruct clients who wanted to share their experience of my work  and how to set up a profile so the second account was just for learning purposes.  Hopefully you can delete it.  Kind regards,  Marie@MarieEndres.com

Greetings, Jason Aller,  I am very new to daviswiki and still have a lot to learn about it.  Thank you for the forward Welcoming Business Owners.  I did read it but still have many questions.  It would really help me if someone  could talk to me about how to do what is ok to do.

Yes, I entered some quotes about my work from people  who have given me their permission.  The daviswiki time stamp and my name after their names seemed unnecessary to me since I had their permission.  However, I do now  understand  why that is not ok on daviswiki but it is ok on my website.  I assumed that I could not edit things that were not ok with daviswiki to edit.

I have entered again the quotes by others but left the daviswiki time stamp and my name at the end.  I trust this is now  in the format that is acceptable here.

Previously, I have asked others who have benefited from my work to share their comments on daviswiki but they did not find it easy.  So, I am trying to figure out instructions to send them to make it easier.  Also, I am thinking it is easier if I enter their comments for them.   I really have spent several hours with two  friends trying to figure this all out so clients could make their own comments.  I would welcome any further suggestions.  Thank you for your time and helpfulness, Marie@MarieEndres.com Users/mwendres

20100430 20:43:22 nbsp Personally, I dont find testimony that is left by the owner of a business very persuasive. It comes across as you trying to promote your business (which is not what the wiki is for) rather than genuine testimony.  I dont mean to impugn your honesty  I would say this about any business.  As someone reading the entry, I dont know what was really said.  I also dont know what negative comments might have been given to the business owner and yet do not appear on the page.  Testimony is far more persuasive if it is left by an individual who establishes an identity on the wiki. Since you have learned how to edit pages and leave comments, surely your clients can learn how to do so, as have the many many others who have contributed to the wiki. Users/CovertProfessor
