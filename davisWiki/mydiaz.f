Welcome to the wiki, My!  Hey, sorry about renaming the entry while you were editing... I thought you were finished for the moment.  I split the entry out into Department and Major so that the research and grad program can be distinct from the undergrad major and the associated information about it.  It sounds like a really neat Department!  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
