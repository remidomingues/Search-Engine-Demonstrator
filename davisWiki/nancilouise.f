Hi Nanci, Welcome to the Wiki!  Is there any reason youre trying to remove the listed phone number on the Amtrak page?  Its also the only number listed at other websites, such as on Yelp (http://www.yelp.com/biz/amtrakdavis ).  Generally, people tend to be opposed to removal of information on the wiki, as long as its relevant.  A direct phone number to a station, rather than a national 1800 line, is likely rather helpful!  users/edwins ES

20101230 10:27:02 nbsp Hi, Is this number (530) 7584220) current and appropriate for the public to use? It is on the Yelp page ES linked. BTW, some of the editors here are willing to work with you on changes.  Users/DonShor

20101230 10:32:18 nbsp Im not doing anything illegal. Please take your threats elsewhere.  Users/WilliamLewis

20101230 12:04:40 nbsp I hope you realize that deleting the number also doesnt remove it from public eye.  If anyone looks at the history of the page they WILL find it so its out there already.... Users/OliviaY
