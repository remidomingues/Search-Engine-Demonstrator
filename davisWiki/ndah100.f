 new or
and a happy non denominational holiday season to you as well.  Why so srs on the bouncers page? I like it all tongue and cheek style like that. Moreover its funny cause its true Daubert

I got your back on the revert.  Happy New Year! jw

Happy New Year to you, too!  cp

Right  I dont question the guys story, but it doesnt justify making that remark  it wouldnt be appropriate against the bouncer in question, much less all of the bouncers in Davis.  cp

So far, pretty good.  Hope yours is going well, too.  cp

Happy March!  (almost).  cp

Long time no see!  I hope alls well. Users/TomGarberson

Hmm, I dont think so.  I dont know much about it, but some have raised questions; see, e.g., http://jezebel.com/5891269/thinktwicebeforedonatingtokony2012thememedujour here and http://thedailywh.at/2012/03/07/onkony20122/ here.  If there was a Davis movement concerning it, that might warrant a page.  Just my opinion, since you asked.  cp

Well, if I were to worry about that, the next thing you know Id be fired up about the Hobbits next door or the Klingons down the street.  Sometimes its better to just let things be.  cp
