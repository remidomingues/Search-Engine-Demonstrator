KDVS eh? You must know Dave Young then. He is a cool cat. You really think Davis needs Measure I ? Daubert
  Regardless of Neils personal thoughts, Im sure his employer The Centaur Group strongly supports their client. Users/MaxMikalonis M.
  KDVS rocks! Dave Young is a pretty cool dude; my roommates might be playing music with him sometime soon Im excited to see it. As for Measure I, I am a supporter. There are too many reasons for me to vote for it. Our current solution just isnt sustainable and much like the KDVS tower project I worked on, this project has been over a decade in the making. I dont think there is a whole lot of validity to No on Is arguments nor is the West Sacramento option a suitable or desirable alternative.
