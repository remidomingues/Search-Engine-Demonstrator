20091114 19:10:42 nbsp Hey Nicki, thanks for adding info on AGTV.  As William says, theres already a page for that: AGTV.  You should add in the material you want to that page as it already has information on it.  http://daviswiki.org/AggieTV?actionraw&version6 Here is the new page you created.

When adding new information onto the AGTV page please remember one of the rules of wiki ethics  namely, Try not to destroy content. When updating outofdate content, it may be valuable to keep some of the history.

Best, Users/PhilipNeustrom
