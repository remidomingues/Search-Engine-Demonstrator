20090428 11:18:28 nbsp I enjoy your restaurant reviews. I like how you seem to know many of the servers/bartenders/etc, it gives it a personal touch that makes me want to retry places I previously didnt like.  Users/EdWins

20110911 23:08:58 nbsp Hopefully you didnt/dont  get the food runner fired  Users/ndah100
  I dont think that will happen ;) The managers know that all the employees are still getting used to their jobs. Users/jsogul
   I doubt the food runner would get fired, true it is opening week(?) there. And if it is busy and they forgot napkins, and you cant fire by saying you forgot napkins!. Hell customers have asked me for stuff and I have forgotten/and or been late to it. It is a restaurant, you have many things to attend to, and sometimes you just forget, thats life.
     Absolutely! Yesterday I had a server not get a chance to fill my water (at a different place), and I chatted briefly with the manager when he filled it about how we were watching our poor server get run ragged back and forth by a huge table with people arriving and leaving, all ordering new stuff each time she visited.  Bad service sometimes happens even with great people.  ⁓Users/JabberWokky ʝ⍵
