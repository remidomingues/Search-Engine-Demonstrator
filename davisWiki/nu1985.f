 (a) Bona fide evidence of majority and identity of the person is a document issued by a federal, state, county, or municipal government, or subdivision or agency thereof, including, but not limited to, a motor vehicle operators license or an identification card issued to a member of the Armed Forces, that contains the name, date of birth, description, and picture of the person.

New military IDs that lack a physical description printed on them would be invalid for the purpose of this statute. However, there are tons of older, valid ID cards that contain a physical description. KetMoRee has turned away people who have presented these older, valid IDs that serve as sufficient age verification under California law.

20091015 19:38:14 nbsp I just talked with someone from CABC and what youre saying is wrong. The older military IDs, like the one that KetMoRees bouncers wrongly rejected that started this mess, have the required information and are perfectly legal for age verification in California. The newer ones arent acceptable until a new law goes into effect in January. Users/WilliamLewis
