20070714 09:56:18 nbsp Hi, and Welcome to the Wiki! Since youve been making the same changes as Users/cliff, Im sure youve noted that historical information and commentsfor the most partarent deleted from wiki pages. I noticed, however, that you deleted Cliff Mohrs name as manager this time around: if he truly is no longer the manager then this would be a legitimate change, however please then comment to that effect so the rest of the wiki community knows why that deletion was made. It is fine if you dont have the name of the new manager handy: sooner or later someone from the wiki would go to Sogas and find out.  Thanks! Users/KevinChin

20080126 05:42:12 nbsp Where would you suggest that people place their reviews rather than on the relevant entry? Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20080130 10:09:32 nbsp You do understand that the deletions you keep making will just keep getting reverted? Users/DonShor

20080202 15:39:21 nbsp Sogas is a great place now and I go there alot. I know many of the employees and yes, Cliff is the manager. The comments from the girl about her bar bill are incorrect. Give them a try and you will be pleased. Yes, the bar has some lowlifes, but EVERY bar that serves booze to college kids has that. Yes, you have to wait, but get a clue there ALOT of people in the nightclub. Do not believe all the negative stuff. Aloso, why delete positive comments, but incorrect negative comments are left up?

20080202 16:01:54 nbsp Youve http://daviswiki.org/Soga%27s?actiondiff&version2157&version1156 deleted a sentence about the history of Sogas several times now. It is history, and the wiki isnt just about current information. If the comments about a bar bill are incorrect, then present an alternative view and explain why they would have to be wrong. Which positive comments do you think were deleted? There were comments that applied to previous management that have been moved to a separate page, but Im not aware of any that have been deleted.

20080306 16:49:54 nbsp Why do you think that The top section is for a description by the current owner or managers of Sogas.? This is a community resource and the Wiki Community has evolved (and continues to evolve) a set of guidelines for how things work around here. Users/JasonAller

20080316 11:05:34 nbsp Honestly, OJ, are you just being stubbornly silent just to play games here?  You have a whole slew of people trying to be friendly, discuss your concerns and youre just staying quiet and stabbing tires in some sort of personal crusade that everybody around you is trying to understand.  We all want the information to be correct, okay?  Were all on the same side here.  Please... taking 30 seconds to explain is more effective than months of subborn, silent vandalism of the history section of Sogas.  At this point you really look like youre just trying to damage the entry, which is why your changes are being reverted within moments of being made.
