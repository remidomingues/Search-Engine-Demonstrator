These labs contain 40 Pentium III Dell OptiPlex computers with varying processor speeds and RAM configurations, running Red Hat Linux (kernel version 2.4.21).

More commonly referred to as X1101X or that place where I try to make the computer do stuff but it doesnt do what I want it to, the ECE (Electrical and Computer Engineering) Undergrad Lab is located in the basement of Kemper Hall, next to the Dungeon. This lab was formerly located in rooms 1101 and 1105. Its where many Electrical and Computer Engineering students spend their days, nights, and weekends. Undergrad ECE labs, which do work regarding circuit simulations (e.g. SPICE), often end up working here.

Most of the activity on Sunday is after noon. Its always busiest at 6 PM, at which time the lab closes on the weekends.

There used to be a problem in the labs regarding their shared applications, where if too many users were performing activity at once the server would crash for fifteen minutes, meaning that it went down exactly at the worst time (while a 40student lab is trying to get work done).

For information on other ECE labs, see Electrical and Computer Engineering.


Used to?  Fifteen minutes?  bwahahahahahha...  They screwed me big time.  As of Fall 04, they had problems with the server that took care of undergrad accounts so accounts froze when the most people needed it.  They also ran out of licenses for Altera and screwed me even more.  I was told that they ordered something to fix the problem that cost something like $40,000 but wouldnt have it installed and fixing the problems until winter quarter.   Users/MarieHuynh
