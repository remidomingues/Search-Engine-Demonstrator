Mission Statement

ouRevolution Our Voice is an AS PAPERS publication.  We place special emphasis on the unique needs of the African American and African community and commit to display the talents, opinions, and concerns thereof.  We recognize that there are many injustices and inequalities which manifest themselves in the daily lives of the Black Student. We also recognize that history has proven that those with resources place themselves in a position to strengthen their society. OROV strives to replace ignorance with knowledge, racism with acceptance, and limits with opportunity.  Through the written word we seek to empower the existence of Black students at UCD, and share with the greater community our experience.
