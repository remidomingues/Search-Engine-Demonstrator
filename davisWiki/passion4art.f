20091018 14:58:31 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki.  About your comments on Angel Eye Care & Family Optometry: I believe that most people understand why you dislike the business based on comments made some months ago.  But returning to lambaste the business without any additional reason is simply not appropriate behavior.  Youve stated your reasons before, and that is really enough.  Continuing to make comments as you have recently only degrades your argument by making you look silly.  I recommend you not spend any more time thinking about how they wronged you and be productive elsewhere on the wiki (such as commenting on places that you REALLY like).  Youll have way more credibility then.  Also, you may want to use your real name.  Cheers. Users/RyanMikulovsky
