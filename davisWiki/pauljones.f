20090823 09:16:13 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. You might want to look at http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgibin/waisgate?WAISdocID04453314628+1+0+0&WAISactionretrieve Section 25660 of the California Business and Professions Code:

{{{25660.  (a) Bona fide evidence of majority and identity of the
person is a document issued by a federal, state, county, or municipal
government, or subdivision or agency thereof, including, but not
limited to, a motor vehicle operators license or an identification
card issued to a member of the Armed Forces, that contains the name,
date of birth, description, and picture of the person.
}}}

And yes (b) may also come into play, but we would have to see the particular ID in order to know if it applies. Users/JasonAller
