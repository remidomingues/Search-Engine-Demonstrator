20081002 23:02:05 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy Paul, and Welcome to the Wiki... and moreover, congratulations on starting Barista Brew!  I hope your opening goes smoothly and your business is successful.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20081219 12:40:35 nbsp Hey, I fixed your photo on Barista Brew, but most entries on the wiki have photos of the actual place, not just a logo (youre part of the community, not just a boring business listing!).  Somebody already mentioned they were swinging by later to get a couple photos to add to the wiki. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20090108 20:42:56 nbsp If you delete the Barista Brew Cafe page, you can rename Barista Brew to Barista Brew Cafe. That will result in a redirect, a better continuity of page history, and all around happier wiki gnomes. Users/JasonAller

20091130 21:56:50 nbsp Have you seen http://baristasbrew.com/? Their website seems to date back to 2004. Users/JasonAller
