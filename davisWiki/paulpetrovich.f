20081129 11:18:20 nbsp Deleting content that you dont like is fruitless and frowned upon. Wiki editors can see what you did in an instant and undo your deletions. The proper way to respond to content you dont like is to add your perspective to the page rather than deleting another persons perspective. Users/WilliamLewis

20081201 19:16:10 nbsp It looks like you removed the content again and William stuck it back, so Ill explain a little more. One of the conventions used on the wiki is that a page in the format Users/paulpetrovich is a personal page and largely you get to choose what is on it, but a page in the format Paul Petrovich is a public figure page and the Wiki Community gets to collaboratively create the content. Public figure pages are used for political candidates and persons of note in the community. One of the good ways to handle content you are unhappy with is to add balancing content to the page.

20081206 20:16:37 nbsp Take a look at Recent Changes. Many people watch recent changes.

Take a look at the history of http://daviswiki.org/Paul_Petrovich?actioninfo.

There are many pages that have had content removed and replaced repeatedly... the removers havent succeeded in removing content, but some have succeeded by choosing other tactics to achieve their ends. Please consider participating in the Wiki Community community here as it can prove to be a valuable means of getting information out about the positive aspects of your developments and could help you sway public opinion about future development efforts. On the other hand continuing to ignore the Wiki Ethics values of the wiki community will only reflect poorly upon you. Users/JasonAller
