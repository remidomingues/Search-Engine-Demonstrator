Please see the Wiki Community/For Profit Restrictions page  as a nonprofit, the Wiki is prohibited by the IRS from being used to promote for profit businesses.  It can be kind of a fine line between adding information and promoting, but some stuff like your addition to Discounts and Freebies seems pretty clearly promotional.  Please be aware of the restrictions! Users/TomGarberson
