20100516 22:28:39 nbsp Hello there, Mr./Ms. Dizzle, and Welcome to the Wiki! Thanks for updating the page on Campus Crusade for Christ. It would be even more helpful if you left a short descriptive note on http://daviswiki.org/Campus_Crusade_for_Christ?actioninfo your edits so other wiki editors can get a brief idea on what part of the page was Recent Changes changed. Also, the Please Remember to Preview preview function can help you consolidate multiple changes into a single save. Happy editing! Users/EBT

20100523 11:05:50 nbsp I notice you removed a lot of content from the Campus Crusade for Christ page. For example there used to be a link from there to the page about everydavisstudent.com. Any chance you could review your edits to see what was lost and consider retaining some of the history that you removed in a history section on the page? Users/JasonAller
