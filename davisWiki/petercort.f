O hai.

I guess youd like to know a little more about me then. OK.

My name is Peter. Its also my grandfathers name. And his grandfather.

Im a student at UC Davis. Im majoring in Genetics. I think DNA is cool, and will be an integral part in the future of medicine.

Im a bit of a nerd. I read a lot, enjoy talking about philosophy, history, art... just about anything that can be construed from multiple perspectives.

Im also a geek.

Yes, the two are different.

Im a big fan of tabletop gaming. Things like Dungeons and Dragons, and Star Wars: Saga Edition

Its not so much the games as it is the players that I find to be truly enjoyable.

Trust me, you really get to see the fun side of people when they create characters.

Andrew, if youre reading this, the character of BR0B0T made me laugh. A lot. Thank you for that.

I guess Ill just leave it at that. If you know me or think you have something cool to add to this article about me, feel free to add to it.
