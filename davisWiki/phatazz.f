20131117 10:05:16 nbsp Ah, thats much better! For a moment I thought Brent had done that (dont know why) and wanted to compliment him on this, but my compliment goes to you. So: my compliment on this Andrea Thomas change!

Still this In fact, she was so busy studying to get into med school, that she really didnt have time to campaign. Which, to be honest, shows she has excellent timemanagement skills and ability to prioritize her life. is not even close to being objective. We dont know anything about Andrea now, do we? But you didnt write this, so I am being rhetorical now. :) Have  a nice day! Users/ConstantiaOomen

20131117 11:56:08 nbsp Ha!  I love the bountifulposterior comment!  I just have seen too many names selected to hurt other people or demean them, and so Im always wary of them.  If youre celebrating yourself, go for it! Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards, (814) 8898845

20131122 19:29:21 nbsp Yeah, its only a cooloff ban.  When people start chewing on each other too much and using the wiki as a weapon, theres a short duration cool off period.  See the Wiki Chill Pill that I redirected both user profiles to.  Part of it is just to give the community as a whole a break and an opportunity for quieter voices to be heard.  We used to do far more of them, but its been awhile since there has been this level of low level, notexplosivebutstilldestructive animosity. Users/JabberWokky

20131122 19:30:44 nbsp Good idea. Users/phatazz

20131122 19:43:57 nbsp Im always really hesitant to ban anybody, but  as I said above  cool off bans used to be pretty common.  Interestingly, it was often ASUCD related years ago.  Permabans almost involve the community discussing and deciding by consensus.  The couple exceptions have involved police and serious threats, or medical conditions and pleas to be banned because they couldnt help themselves: over the past nine years eventually there were a couple occasions when things got really bad.  Overall, they are pretty rare. Users/JabberWokky

20131201 16:48:18 nbsp Ever met Daubert in person?  The best single word to describe him would be exuberant.  Two words?  Highly caffeinated, although I dont think it is from caffeine.  Hes probably not angry, although I can certainly see somebody taking it that way, especially if you dont have a lot of experience with his writing style.  Tone is a hard thing to pick up in text.  Of course, I could always be off, but knowing he talks like that about everything, at about 900 words per minute, helps.  One of the great things about the wiki that separates it from being simply an internet website is that its a real network of neighbors who can (and often do) meet face to face. Users/JabberWokky
