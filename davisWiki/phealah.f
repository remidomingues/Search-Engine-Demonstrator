20111204 10:52:07 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki!  Please take a moment to read over the Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner business owner intro page.  Theres a lot of good info there.  One of the key things is that the Wiki cant be used for promotional purposes due to its nonprofit agreement with the IRS.  Information needs to be presented in an informational or education, rather than promotional, way.  Both of the business pages you created have been tweaked a bit to conform with the nonprofit requirements and some general wiki standards.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask!
