20120324 20:31:44 nbsp Why did you remove the emails from The Ramble Apartments?  Do you have reason to know that those people dont want their email addresses on the page? Users/CovertProfessor

20120324 21:42:57 nbsp Much as you seem to have a preference for some anonymity, so do they.  Please respect it. Users/pilotgeek

20120324 21:51:23 nbsp Youll note that I have been respecting it, since I did not revert your change.  I was simply confirming that you were not trying to protect people who had not asked to be protected.  Try checking your attitude next time. Users/CovertProfessor

20120324 21:57:14 nbsp The question was shared by others... with no reason given, we dont know if are you removing those emails they added because they wish it, or because you are a competitor, or because you dont like the at symbol.  With no answer, I still dont know what to think about the edit. You may well have a great reason.  Could you please share it? Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20120324 22:35:50 nbsp @cp That is always an issue with the electronic medium.  I intended clarify, you read attitude (none intended). Users/pilotgeek

20120324 22:46:16 nbsp @evan What question?  Who others?  Society of Wiki Editors? :) Seriously, I was asked to remove the addresses by the manager, as they prefer not to have their personal emails on a web page. Users/pilotgeek

20120324 23:27:04 nbsp Well, at least two people, cp and myself.  Thats a we.  I was just pointing out that s/he wasnt alone in wondering.  This seems somehow awfully formal and antagonistic for a simple query about an edit.  You removed stuff... people asked why.  Its not exactly an interrogation or asking you to defend your existence.  Just wondering why you deleted some stuff.  Thats all.  People ask me the same thing.  Heck, Im pretty sure Ive asked cp in the past why something was deleted. Users/JabberWokky

20120325 10:14:51 nbsp I didnt read in any attitude.  When you reminded me of my own anonymity, you were reminding me to be consistent, as though I might not be.  When you said, Please respect it, you implied that I might not respect their anonymity, so you had to request that I do so  even though I had not undone your edits and had specifically asked you if they had requested privacy.  In other words, you assumed bad behavior on my part even though all evidence suggested good behavior.  Thats insulting.  As JW notes, people remove information from the wiki all the time (something that is normally frowned upon), and not all of their reasons are good ones.  For example, within the last month someone changed the phone number of a Chinese restaurant to the number of a different Chinese restaurant in town.  So, we (meaning, we who care about the wiki remaining a useful resource) have to ask when information is changed or removed.

Look, I get it.  The Ramble Apartments opened up with a lot of fanfare, but based on the longwinded yet articulate comments on the page, it hasnt lived up to the hype.  I can certainly understand why, under those circumstances, people would not want their email addresses on the page.  Now, Im sure youll tell me that that isnt the reason, but that is how it appears from the outside.  They might want to consider that. Users/CovertProfessor

20120330 13:41:07 nbsp @cp OK.. I read this and gave myself some time to not be annoyed.  Seriously.. there was no attitude in my original comment.  I wrote that below and meant it.  I do care about the wiki as a useful resource, as I use it all the time and contribute occasionally.  There is nothing sinister going on in my removing the addresses, just contact preferences.

Since you mentioned the information on the Ramble page, I will say that the editorial at the top of all pages should be mostly factual, as opposed to opinion.  And at the ramble that is simply not the case, but I am refraining from editing that, as it will ultimately take care of itself (as the facility gets out of its infancy).  I have seen numerous times where tilted opinions are removed from the informative section, both by you.. and frankly by me as well.  Of course, comments are comments  opinions  and they belong in that location on the page.  I would never suggest ones freedom of speech should revoked. Users/pilotgeek
 I will say that the editorial at the top of all pages should be mostly factual, as opposed to opinion. You have not been paying attention. The informative/comment section distinction you perceive is an unfortunate artifact of people being more willing to use the comment box than the edit button. There are pages loaded with opinion that dont have a comment barthat was the default state of pages on this wiki for a long time in fact. Users/WilliamLewis
