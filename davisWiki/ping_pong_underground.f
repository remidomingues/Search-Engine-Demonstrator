Social hours go by the same rule  pay $3 at the door, or 25 cents per game. All Payments are on the honor system: proceeds go towards keeping Third Space going  if you like the space, pitch your quarters!

Game play is controlled by a monster pink, partalien, partcomputer, 1tonbraininatank named Tex, kept under six feet of concrete and lead in the underground bunker below the space. Tex likes good vibes and Eclectic American music.

The Ping Pong Underground is also open to nonplayer visitors and socialites. It boasts the most deadly ping pong in the Central Valley.
