I went to college at UC Davis and now I am working there.  Being in Davis for so long, I am trying to try out all the restaurants/dessert places/bakeries in Davis.  My list is about 80% checked off.  Well see if I can completely check off all the places on the list; there is always one place closing and a new one opening :0/


20110330 21:44:47 nbsp Hello and welcome to the Wiki! I think we should work together because I would like Davis Wiki to be complete and you want to check off your list, but since Davis keeps changing, that can never happen. My ultimate goal for the Wiki is to completely grab all the information about Davis and then destroy the city of Davis before any new information can be added. We can probably work together on the destroying part once you finish your list and I finish gathering information. Users/hankim

20110330 22:11:27 nbsp Hi hankim .....im not sure what your goals really are .....but my goal is just trying out different foods in davis.  Please dont post anything on my page anymore.  You are not welcome on my page.  Thanks.  And what in the world are thinking.  I love Davis why are you thinking about destroying this beautiful place? Users/purplemonkey
     Nah, Hankim has the right idea..this place needs to burn. All the superfund sites, hypocrites and losers need run out of town. Completely leveling this place and rebuilding it is really the only option. I say 2 or 3 daisy cutters would do the job. Users/JoshLawson


20110330 22:40:16 nbsp To make the Davis Wiki complete and keep it complete of course! This way you will be able to complete your list and keep it complete too! Users/hankim

20110331 08:11:45 nbsp The most critical question of all, of course, is:  What shade of purple are you?  Are you a reddish purple monkey, or an indigopurple, or something in between?  Welcome to the wiki! Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20110331 08:17:08 nbsp Someone should probably mention that people can get a little goofy in the evenings around here.  Welcome to the Wiki! Users/TomGarberson
