hello people!
this is my first time in a wiki website. so excuse all of the random editing mistakes. i promise to get better in time.
i happen to love making food, eating food, and drinking, so you will see many of my comments on those pages...
i am student at ucdavis, majoring in biology; and i will be a student forever.
