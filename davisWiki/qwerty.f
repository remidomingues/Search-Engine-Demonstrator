20070926 14:00:46 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki! I actually never lived there at Unviersity village, just quite a few people I know. I suggested the same to them, but I dont know they followed through or not. Users/JamesSchwab

20070927 20:57:19 nbsp oh man.....im in the process of trying to leave. my girl friend talked to a lawyer to get some advice. well, marie is a liar. she lied to my girl friend about the renual lease saying it was exactly the same as the old one when it wasnt at all. the lease is 25 pages so who wants to read that again? she also said that it wasnt really necessary to read it again. my girl friend said that she had heard that it was different. marie made no mention about the differences and never showed where they were. anyway, she signed it only to find out later that it had been changed in many places...especially  the part where the is a buy out option if one wants to leave. there is none anymore. think of living here as a 9 month prison sentence. your stuck until the lease is over. well, marie was sloppy so well see if that really plays out. we cant say how were trying to break it yet, but well let others know if it works out. in the mean time, tell everyone you know NOT to rent here. we call it a hell hole and thats what this place is. my gril friend is also having issues with her housemates, too. yeah, its a joke. they dont care. dont believe anything the people in the office tell you. get it in writing. oh, if they bill you, ASK to see the bill!!!
