Law Student graduating in 2012.

You should fight Tanglewood.  See the page on Tenant Rights down in the security deposits section.   They cant charge you for paint...its a crap trick a lot of apartment complexes do.  As long as you guys didnt mess up the walls, youre in the clear.  Especially if you took a lot of pictures to prove it.   First step is to call them, and tell the manager that their not giving you back your full deposit is a breach of the contract.  Hopefully you have a copy of the contract still, which is probably the Davis Model Lease users/edwins ES
