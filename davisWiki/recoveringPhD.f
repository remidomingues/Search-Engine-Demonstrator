Welcome to the Wiki Howdy, Dr. Recovering, and Welcome to the Wiki!   You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you (or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here).  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for adding a review to some of the kennel pages, it is great to see how much people care about their Dogs and other pets.

You wrote: There are TONS of other kennels in the Davis/Woodland area if you look (not all are here on the daviswiki though) that are way better and only slightly more costly, which sounds like you know quite a bit about the local kennels.  It would be absolutely fantastic if you could add the ones you know about to the Davis Wiki and also the wiki:woodland Woodland Wiki.  Every entry on here was written by people just like you, and the entire site is a community effort.  Since it sounds like you know the topic, it would be wonderful if you could contribute a bit about the local kennels... or any other topic!

Once again, welcome to the wiki, and thanks for the reviews.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
