20080911 21:34:22 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy Ms. or Mr. Ers, and Welcome to the Wiki!   You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you (or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here).  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for updating the information about the Rec Pool, but it is generally a better idea to edit under your name.  I mean, you probably arent the only person who uses the Rec Pool, and you might want to comment on Front Page other things around Davis in the future.  Anyway, whoever you are, welcome to the wiki!
