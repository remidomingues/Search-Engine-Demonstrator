20090126 18:19:26 nbsp My room mates and I signed the lease for 2009 with the guidance of Mani, and she was extremely helpful.  She told us everything we needed to do, the deadlines, and was very accommodating to our questions.  There is a 24/7 gym and computer lab with free printing and copies, and the sample room they showed us looked very nice!  We are bringing our dogs, as the place is very pet friendly, and its conveniently located next the bus stop and in a quiet neighborhood.  Ill post another comment once my room mates and I are settled in next year! Users/tuminator
