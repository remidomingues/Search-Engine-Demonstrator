Hi Renee, and welcome to the wiki!  You might be interested in the Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner page as well.  Im intrigued by what youve noted about Cornish Kitchen and Catering  especially the fact that you do wings at what sounds like a pretty good price.  You might want to add some info about the business in the main body of its page, as well.  Ill look forward to checking it out.  Also, it looks like the hours are a little odd on the page.  You might want to clarify Saturday hours, and make a note that its closed on Mondays if thats the case. Users/TomGarberson
