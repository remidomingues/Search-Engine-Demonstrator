Feel free to add or correct points in the current entry, but the entry is community edited.   The entry about Renaissance Park Apartments is not a commercial space for advertising or marketing purposes.  If you have questions, feel free to ask, but do not simply bulk delete the entry again without any explaination, as that is generally considered abusive editing and spam.
