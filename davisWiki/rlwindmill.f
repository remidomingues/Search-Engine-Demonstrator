20100524 16:33:38 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki, Mr/Ms. Windmill! Thanks for kind words you left on Nahzis page. However, as of right now, that is the only edit made on this user account. While that certainly does not immediately invalidate your comment, you should consider branching out and editing a few other pages to lend more Wiki Community/Reputation credibility to your words. Thanks, and happy editing! Users/EBT
