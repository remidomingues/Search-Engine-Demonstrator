Rolfing (aka Structural Integration) is a type of body manipulation that addresses recent and lifelong patterns of strain in the body and its connective tissues. Postural balance and functional use is restored through handson bodywork and some practitioners take clients through gentle exercises. This is usually, but not always, done through a 10 session protocol. Sessions run anywhere from 6090 minutes.


Principles of Intervention

Rolfing SI training begins with the TenSeries developed by Dr. Rolf. Over the years, the faculty at the Rolf Institute has articulated the core principles on which the original series was based, including variations of Dr. Rolfs original protocol. By understanding these principles Rolfers can work effectively inside or outside of the TenSeries and incorporate intervention strategies that reflect the unique needs of each client.

Gentle Techniques

As Rolfers™ work with the deep myofascial structures, some people may experience the work as uncomfortable; however, Rolfers have continued to develop a broad range of techniques that produce profound results with less discomfort.

Joint Mobilization Techniques

The Rolf Institute® faculty has created a range of soft tissue techniques that release the motion restrictions that impede whole body organization. These techniques increase Rolfers’ effectiveness in working with many common structural problems.

The Personal Experience

Rolfing SI is a holistic technique in that changes in structure can impact the whole person, physically, emotionally, and energetically. Ultimately, each client’s individual experience plays a central role in Rolfing SI’s transformational aspects.

The Integration of Structure and Function

In Rolf Movement® Integration, the Rolfer helps clients become aware of their inhibiting movement patterns and teaches them how to change them. In Rolfing Structural Integration, the Rolfer releases these patterns through manipulation as they manifest in the clients structure. Rolfing SI is as concerned with how people experience and use their bodies in their daily lives as with their structural organization in gravity. This unique blend of both, the functional and structural aspects of Rolfing SI, is a distinctive feature of the training at RISI.

Rolfing Structural Integration is not a form of massage

One of the most common misconceptions about Rolfing SI is that it is a nothing more than a type of very deep massage. There are many varieties of massage, which are particularly effective for loosening tight tissue, reducing stress, detoxing the body and an increased feeling of relaxation and wellbeing. Since these benefits are also a byproduct of Rolfing SI, the general public experience confusion as to the precise difference between our work and the proliferation of effective touch modalities currently available.
Rolfing SI balances the body in gravity

Ray McCall, a Certified Advanced Rolfer in Boulder and former student of Dr. Rolf, once said that what Rolfers do can be summed up in three words: palpation, discrimination and integration.

     We palpate, or touch the tissue, feeling for imbalances in tissue texture, quality and temperature to determine where we need to work.
     We discriminate, or separate fascial layers that adhere and muscles that have been pulled out of position by strain or injury.
     Finally, we integrate the body, relating its segments in an improved relationship, bringing physical balance in the gravitational field.
