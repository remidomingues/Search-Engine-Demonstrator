20081227 08:01:26 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. I noticed that you http://daviswiki.org/Tragic_events?actiondiff&version2478&version1477 removed an entry from the Tragic Events page. It might be helpful to understand that the wiki generally restores content deleted with no reason given. If there is a reason that the entry should be removed and left out leaving a comment in the area below the edit area is a good idea. It helps communicate why you believe that the section you removed should stay off the page. Let us know if you have any further questions. Users/JasonAller
