From your comment on AbcDefs page, I am unsure of the information you seek.  Are you looking for information on how to arrange for the construction of flood control dams, weirs, and waterways?  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is probably a good place to start.  You can find the Sacramento branch here: http://www.spk.usace.army.mil/

General information on flood control: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_control
