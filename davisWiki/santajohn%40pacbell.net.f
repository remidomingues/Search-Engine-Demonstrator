20091116 17:45:26 nbsp  Welcome to the Wiki. You can establish identity here in a variety of ways. I see someone reverted your edits to the Merryhill School page; maybe you should read Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner guide for business owners. Youve already chosen your Importance of using your RealName username, so the next step would be to introduce yourself and make some positive contributions like adding business reviews, Photo Requests uploading photos, or adding to Seed Pages List pages that need more information.

20091117 13:15:14 nbsp While there are often good reasons for removing the contributions of others, like you have done on Merryhill School, you havent given us any. When something is deleted on Davis Wiki and no reason is given, someone generally puts that information back. If you want to make such edits to the page in the future, I suggest you discuss why youre making these edits at http://daviswiki.org/Merryhill_School/Talk?actionrecall&version8 Merryhill School/Talk. Let me or Jason know if you have any questions. Users/WilliamLewis
