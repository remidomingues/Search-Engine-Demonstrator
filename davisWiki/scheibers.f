Dear Mrs. Scheiber,
We are greatly saddened at your dissatisfaction with your job. Tile repair is always a very complicated process, and we did our best to inform you of the difficulty of the situation, and the fact that tiles tend to chip, no matter how carefully they are removed. Our installer did do additional labor at no additional charge, and even discussed doing an additional area free of charge with your husband. However, you decided against it. As a store that values customer service above all else, we did everything in our power to appease you. We apologize that things ended the way they did.
