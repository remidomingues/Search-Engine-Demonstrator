The Wiki is maintained by everyone (you and me are included), so if you find incorrect information or an urge to edit something, you should do so. If any problems arise, we can always talk it out.

20100504 15:08:27 nbsp You can edit any page by clicking the edit button at the top of that page. Users/JoePomidor

20100504 19:37:10 nbsp Edit!  Thou art empowered as much as we all are.  Make the words correct, and let others follow and add to what you have written!  Go forth and Wiki! Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20100521 13:14:38 nbsp Why are you adding yelp links? Most places here have plenty of reviews on the page. Seems like youre just cluttering up the page to me. Users/WilliamLewis

20100521 13:15:28 nbsp Sorry, I will stop. I thought it would be helpful, since I usually check both before visiting a place. Users/scrizer

20100521 13:17:59 nbsp No problem. Id wanted to suggest this somewhere, but it seemed directly editing a page is the only way to do that. Users/scrizer
 For future reference, you can post it to the Wiki Community/General Discussion General Discussion area. Users/EBT
 Thanks, and sorry about the clutter. Also, Im a UC Davis student and in no way affiliated with yelp. Users/scrizer
    Dont worry too much about it. Im sure it was goodintentioned. ebt
    No worries... its not a terrible idea, it just doesnt seem to quite fit most peoples view of what is appropriate for an entry about a local restaurant.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwardsi

20100521 14:19:19 nbsp I think overall yelp is a good thing, not many cities have a wiki as nice as Davis and customer reviews are a helpful.  However, Yelp does engage in very aggressive marketing for their advertising packages (they could not understand what I meant by No thank you).  And if you sign up for the minimum $300/month package then your reviews and ads will be highlighted when people are searching yelp for your type of business.  Which, in my opinion, defeats the purpose of a review site. Users/DagonJones
