20100707 17:10:28 nbsp When someone makes comments about the waitstaff at a place like the antisocial chick with the glasses,  but doesnt have the decency to establish some identity on the wiki before making those comments they come off looking like the sort of person who takes potshots at people from the cloak of anonymity. The wiki community is an extension of the Davis community; in both your behavior is a reflection of who you are. The wiki has seen a lot of identity/abuse this and I think it is pushing the general consensus toward changing how the wiki works. If you value the wiki as a local resource behave in a way while you are here that will improve the wiki and ensure its long term survival. Users/JasonAller
