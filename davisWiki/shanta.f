20100103 16:21:19 nbsp Hi Shanta,

Thanks for your recent updates to the page.  Let me see if I can elaborate on Jasons comments above.  The wiki doesnt provide business listings  but it does have pages that are written by the community and for the community.  So, although it is great when business owners participate, they need to understand that the page is written from the point of view of the community.  That means, among other things, that the page says they rather than we.  It also means that comments from members of the community are kept (unless they are offensive, personal attacks, etc.).  So, youll notice I made some more edits to the Bicycle Bakery page to put it back to third person and to restore the comments you deleted.  The page that Jason recommends for Business Owners explains this in more detail.
