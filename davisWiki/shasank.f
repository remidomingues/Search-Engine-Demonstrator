20110616 08:32:57 nbsp Welcome to the wiki!  From the edits that you made recently to the Bombay Dreams Restaurant page, I think you may also want to read Welcome to the wiki/Business Owner, since it seems as though you are affiliated with that business.  In particular, please understand that the purpose of the wiki is to explore, discuss and compile anything and everything about Davis â€” especially the little, enjoyable things.  It is not a business listing site.  So, that means that things like the history of a site (what business was located there before) and when it opened up are kept on the page.  Relevant links, such as links to Indian restaurants, are also kept on the page.  And the page will be jointly and collaboratively edited by members of the Davis community, including, of course, yourself!  Again, welcome. Users/CovertProfessor
