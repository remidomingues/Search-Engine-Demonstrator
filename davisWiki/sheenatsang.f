20100907 12:23:49 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy Sheena (sorry if I got your name wrong, Im not sure where that splits), and welcome to the wiki!   My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for comment on University Court Apartments.  As I said there, if you dont like the photos, take some more representative ones and put them up.  This entry belongs to you and the rest of Davis; it isnt an advertisement for University Court Apartments.  You own that entry as much as they do, and it was written by people like you and me.  The wiki is a community effort, not a place to advertise businesses.  Feel free to edit rather than just leaving comments!  Once again, welcome to the wiki!
