you might have seen me on my vintage bike singing
or at Delta of Venus delta venus
or cleaning up my house from the constant tping
or randomly starring at a field
or protesting on the island in front of shell gas station
or in a play
or walking with my friends
or buying music
or playing music
or laughing at something random
i can be childish and wildish
i have no filter between my brain and mouth
