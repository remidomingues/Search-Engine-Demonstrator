20081209 17:55:06 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy Shorty, and Welcome to the Wiki! My names Evan, pleased to meet you.  You seem to be trying to delete reviews that are critical of the Bike Barn... perhaps youre connected to the business somehow (or just a fan?).  You might want to take a look at Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner the informal community written suggestions for business owners.  In general, most reviews (both positive and negative) are welcome and encouraged.  For instance, nobody has deleted your negative Apex review.  If you have something positive to say, or a response to one of the negative reviews, that might be a big more constructive than simply deleting reviews, as most of the body of active People wiki editors will just continue to restore them.
