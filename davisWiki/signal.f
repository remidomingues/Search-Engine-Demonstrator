20090917 18:09:41 nbsp Could you please stand behind your real name? What youre writing is a bit over the top and you really should stand behind your words. Users/WilliamLewis

20090917 18:14:04 nbsp Also, if youre going to call someone a liar, why dont you specify what they lied about to you? Right now, youre messing up formatting and adding some pretty serious accusations without standing behind your words or providing any concrete detail to back them up.  Users/WilliamLewis

Look at the edit youre making. There are several things wrong with it. By convention here, the title of an article is bolded on its first mention in the page. Youve removed that. Youve also removed the information about the fee they charge owners for management. Then, you claim various things like corruption without citing examples of why theyre corrupt. If you want to claim theyre corrupt without citing specific examples, you can do that as much as you like as long as you stand behind your remarks by attributing them to yourself and using your real name. Otherwise, Im just going to have to delete them again. Users/WilliamLewis
