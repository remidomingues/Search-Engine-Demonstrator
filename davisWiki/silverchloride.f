20080621 13:41:30 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy, Mr. or Ms. Chloride, and Welcome to the Wiki!   You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you (or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here).  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for adding a review to the Yolo Fruit Stand entry.  You had also called into question if another editor was from Davis or not  quite a few people who live in Davis work elsewhere, or work in Davis but live in Woodland or Sacramento.  Some people on the Davis Wiki (like myself) have even moved a good distance away for some reason but still maintain a connection to Davis (friends or family live there or in the area).  I moved your comment to the Talk page for the entry, since it doesnt deal directly with the subject.  That way people can talk about the point you brought up without overwhelming the actual entry with back and forth discussion about a side issue.  Youve got a good eye for detail, though... and once again, welcome to the wiki!  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
