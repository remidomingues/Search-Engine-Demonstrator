20091031 21:14:29 nbsp Howdy Ms. sirotilC, and Welcome to the Wiki!   You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you.  Or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here.   In a related vein, I believe your genitals are on backwards.  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for the review of Rat Shack; they have some pretty aggressive salespeople there... Im sorry that they wouldnt replace whatever it was you bought.  Once again, welcome to the wiki! wiki:gnome:Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
