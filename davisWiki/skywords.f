Hi,
Perhaps youd like to put this comment on the right page. Please see the reply by James Morton, which I pasted below. Users/DonShor


20101030 01:41:36 nbsp He may mean well, and I see that others like him.  But I had what appeared to be a virus.  He said it was and scrubbed my computer clean.  VERY BAD IDEA!  I lost some VERY VALUABLE INFO, as a result of his haste, incompetence or sheer criminality.  THIS GUY IS WAY TOO HYPER AND JUMPS TO TOO MANY CONCLUSIONS.  Suffice it to say that I lost important data, paid way way too much, and his diagnosis was WRONG.  I didnt have a virus:  I just needed to run computer cleaner.  Thats ALL.  I wish Id just gone to Heron (now called Davis Computer).  BTW, Computer Genius is a rude and insane dude with delusions of grandeur who does little or nothing and charges way too much and rarely answers his phone, if ever. Users/skywords


20101030 15:21:08 nbsp Skywords, This is Davis Computer Doctor, and we have no relationship with The Computer Genius.  I believe You left the Reply to the wrong Company.  Davis Computer Doctor is not related to either davis computer or computer genius.  Davis Computer Doctor is connected to other computer doctor companies in other states, has no involvement with the mentioned companies. Please remove this review because this work was not done by Davis Computer Doctor.   Users/JamesMorton

20110627 21:57:06 nbsp I understand that you think CoDependents Anonymous is a great group that many people can benefit from, and that youre just trying to spread the word, but information about the group doesnt belong on pages to which it has no connections.  I can see that alcoholrelated issues often have involve codependency, so those links make sense to me, but the mens talk and drum circle?  The La Leche League?  I fail to see the connection to these and many of the other pages that you put links on. Users/CovertProfessor

Hey, Mr. or Ms. skywords.  I removed most of the rest of the links, for the same reason I removed them when Barbara did the same thing earlier this year.  Is it some kind of marketing thing your group does?  It doesnt seem very 12 steppy, as it seems to run somewhat afoul of the eleventh tradition in some ways; not clearly, Ill grant you, but in the same way excessive fliering rather than simple notices tends to.  Anyway, its pretty much the same reason as when Barbara posted the links, so I figured Id just quote the message I left her:

   20110212 nbsp Howdy Barbara, and Welcome to the Wiki.  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for adding information about CoDependents Anonymous and linking it in places like Support Groups, but many of the topics you linked it under seem to be very inappropriate.  It would appear you are just trying to add links to as many entries as possible to raise awareness of the organization.  That seems like a good idea, but if everybody did it, then the CoDependents Anonymous entry would be buried under links to various additional support groups, soccer leagues that promoted fellowship and just about every religious and spiritual group in Davis. Cause oriented spam seems like a noble idea, but in practice, it is like covering up other peoples fliers on a bulletin board.  I removed several of your edits  not because I dont support the idea of CoDA!  but rather because they were not really ontopic for the subject of the entries you added them to.  I left them in all the general topic entries like Support Groups or the Sexual Assault & Domestic Violence Center, which seems to have an open list of alternative support resources on it.  I hope you understand that I did this for the exact same reason you added the links: to improve the wiki as a resource for people looking for help.  I mean it sincerely when I say welcome to the wiki, and thank you for the additions you made to the CoDA relevant entries!   Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
