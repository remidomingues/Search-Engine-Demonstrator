20120311 17:00:23 nbsp Welcome to the wiki. Youll notice that the changes that you made recently to the Lasting Impressions Hair Design page were undone.  If you read Welcome to the wiki/Business Owner this page I think you will get a better explanation of why the changes that you made were not consistent with the wikis purpose as a community resource (rather than, say, a business listing site, which it is not).  If you have any questions, please ask.  You are also encouraged to edit other pages on the wiki not related to your business, to help make the wiki a resource for all. Users/CovertProfessor

20120311 18:45:48 nbsp As CP said, please read the Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner business owner/representative welcome page.  It will explain the problems with the first person perspective and the promotional language. Users/TomGarberson

20120311 19:00:19 nbsp I presume from your name that youre selling some kind of service to business owners to create or improve wiki pages about them. If this is the case, I submit you are doing your clients a disservice because you clearly dont understand what the wiki is or how it works. You only make your clients look worse.

In one of your recent edit comments, you justify reverting to an inferior (as judged by the community standards here) version of the page with the comment authorized by Lating Impressions owner Gerri Adler. The authorization or will of the subject of a page carries no extra weight here. The Davis Wiki is a community run resource that belongs to the community. It is not simply a business listing site run for the benefit of local businesses. Users/WilliamLewis
