20110327 15:35:46 nbsp Hello and welcome to the wiki. The ARC lends out climbing shoes and harnesses for the climbing wall, you just need to go to the desk by the locker rooms and give them your UCD Student ID card or whatever you use to get into the ARC unless you used a day pass or something. Of course, one might question the cleanliness of those shoes because they do rather look quite funky. Users/hankim
