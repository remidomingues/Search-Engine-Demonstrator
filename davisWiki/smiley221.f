20080603 23:38:44 nbsp Hello, smiley221, and welcome to the wiki!   My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  I know somebody who recently finished the last book of the trilogy that starts with The Giver, and she enjoyed it quite a bit.  I hope you enjoy the series as well.  I grew up in South Florida and used to go on canoe trips through a river where monkeys lived and they would sometimes throw leaves at us as we passed by.  They dont make very good pets, but they are fun to watch.  Once again, welcome to the wiki! Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
