Hi, Welcome to the Wiki. I noticed you mentioning yelp.com on the Crepe House Uni page. Now that Yelp has been determined to be a fake site, I think links to it could be considered spam, although I think yours is sincere. Thanks for your contribution, please be careful about linking to yelp.com.  Users/NickSchmalenberger
