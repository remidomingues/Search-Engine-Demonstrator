Howdy mysterious stranger, and Welcome to the Wiki!   You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you.  Or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here, and this is a community of local people.  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  You know, it might be better to just edit the Renaissance Park Apartments directly to add some of that kind of stuff to the main part of the page.  You might want to check with management to confirm some of the upgrades first. Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
