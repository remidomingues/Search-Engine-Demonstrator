Moi:

Mortuary science student. Sorority girl. Grew up as a kid in Davis and then returned in my adulthood. Done some local modeling for small Sacramento businesses.  I like robofashion and technosexual lust and candyfuturism and retrofuturism. I really like hairless cats. I won a scholarship for being tall a few years ago. I really like my food raw, but Ill eat a good hamburger.

Three fictional creatures from pop culture I wish existed in real life: mogwais (without the Gremlin adulthood stage), totoros (the big kind... and the small kind), blobs (from A Boy and His Blob). The robots in Silent Running are also endearing and cute but theyre not really creatures but I wish they existed anyway.

Oopsie, I didnt use tons of links as references. Maybe someday.
