Using an organizational name here is frowned upon, since youre essentially introducing yourself to your neighbors as speedeetee.  Your response to a customer is a good one, and I hope youll continue contributing to the wikijust under a new account name.  See Wiki Community/Organizational Accounts/Help this page for more info.

In a day or two this account will be disabled, but its easy to create a new one to edit under your own name!  You can also do it yourself by going into settings in the upper right corner and using the Disable forever option. Users/TomGarberson
