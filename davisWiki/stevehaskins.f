20100929 14:49:58 nbsp Welcome to the wiki, and thanks for adding a page on Hacienda Halaguena!  You may wish to read Welcome to the Wiki/Business owner to get a better sense of the wikis collaborative editing process.  I edited the first sentence of the page so that it is a full sentence and so that it is clear that it is something that only an owner/employee would say, since the wiki is written from a community perspective.  Also, I helped out a bit with the images that you uploaded so that they show up on the page. Users/CovertProfessor
