20080526 23:47:17 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. Hey instead of deleting pages how about adding {{{Include(Departed Business)}}} to the top? That way history is preserved and people are notified that the place isnt in business any more? Users/JasonAller

20080527 01:40:25 nbsp Is that dentist no longer there?  If so, you should probably add the bit about it being a departed business (as mentioned below).  If she is still a practicing dentist in davis then Im wondering why you deleted the page..  I went ahead and added the note about the business no longer being there. Users/PhilipNeustrom

20080527 06:17:22 nbsp Just add {{{Include(Departed Business)}}} to the top  if you want to be really good about it, you can also rewrite the entry to the past tense and add a note about when and/or why they closed.  The Davis Wiki covers past groups and businesses as well (in fact, if you know of one from 20 years ago, feel free to add it as a former part of Davis). Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
