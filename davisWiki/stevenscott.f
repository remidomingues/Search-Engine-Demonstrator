20100829 09:14:55 nbsp Hi, and welcome to the wiki!  The comment that you left on the Cambridge House Apartments page has generated a lot of discussion.  I think everyone is sympathetic to the bad experience that it sounds like you had.  But many are concerned about the one sentence of your comment that sounds like a personal attack.  Perhaps you would consider changing that one sentence?  After all, its the details of your complaint that really make it persuasive.  If anything, the personal attack detracts from your complaints.  So, I encourage you to change it, and also, to stick around on the wiki to make further edits.  Again, welcome! Users/CovertProfessor
