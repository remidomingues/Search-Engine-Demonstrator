I saw that youve been editing the wiki for a little over a week, but nobody welcomed you... the holidays kind of makes everybody busy, but I just wanted to say Welcome to the Wiki!  I agree with you about Cloud Forest Cafe: the people there are quite friendly.    Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
