Tis doubtful with such low taste and superficial criticism (finding the likes of G St. Pub intriguing and reducing DoVs patrons to judgmental hippies doesn’t bode well), but I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt. Perhaps if you come down from your vulgar station youll learn to dissociate appearance from reality :) Give DoV more time, at least . . . perhaps there was something worth judging, if you sensed judgment in the air.
