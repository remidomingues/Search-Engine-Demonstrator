20081004 09:19:50 nbsp  Welcome to the Wiki. Please read Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner; it will help explain how you can make the wiki a positive experience for you without clashing with established wiki social norms. For instance continually referring to your business on pages about your competitors  is pretty poor form. Users/JasonAller

20081009 22:54:10 nbsp I just had bad experience at the cable car wash. I just try to give people who might have same experience as I did to try other location.
I do not know why their page is not on the wiki as they should put themself on this page. I know I was talking to the owner they
have internet page already. I do not remember the name If I knew I would tell you as well. I am sorry  you did not
like my comments but I was letting people aware there is another car wash in town now.  Users/sue
