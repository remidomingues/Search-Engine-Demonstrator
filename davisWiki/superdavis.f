Molitor was awesome for my ortho, and he was also down to give a look at my buddy who stopped his braces attempt and just had the brackets remaining.

What kind of dental service are you trying to find? Unless Molitor has branched out he was many orthodontics and not just your average dentist. Why did you remove your comment? I found nothing wrong with it at all!  Users/StevenDaubert
(30 seconds later after re reading your response to me) I dont think your comment was bad at all, price is a relevant factor to folks esp in a college town. I wouldnt say your comment is harmful at all, you even had some positives... I personally think you should put it back!
