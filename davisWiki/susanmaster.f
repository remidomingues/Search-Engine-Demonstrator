20100912 16:31:08 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy Susan, and a belated welcome to the wiki!   My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  I read your really helpful comment on Yolo County SPCA and thought it was so insightful and helpful that it really should be at the top of the entry, so I moved it up there.  Keep in mind that everything on the wiki was written by people like you and me... dont feel that you are only allowed to comment.  You can edit any entry and add your voice right into the top part; it was all written by normal folk, and everybody has an equal opportunity to write and edit anything on the wiki.  Thanks again for the clarification on what is probably a misunderstood (and apparently often seen as hostile) process.  Getting the internal perspective helps people understand what is going on.  Once again, welcome to the wiki! Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
