Resident of Davis for 6 years: chose the house I live in because its walking distance to Covell Nugget.

I live here with my lovely, smart U.C.D. grad wife, and two dogs. I am a landscape designer,
local food advocate and wannabe vineyard owner.

I think Davis is one of the top 10 best towns in Cal. to be trapped in during a recession.
(Sonoma, Capitola, Ojai, Pacific Beach are others, but I cant afford them)

The only flaw I can see is a big university that draws international students,
and yet we have no/few good restaurants, wine bars or live music. The Grad
does not count. The Palms left. Tucos is nice, but needs to be 4 times bigger.

City government repression of liquor licenses, townies frowning on live venues?
I cant explain.



20090914 20:52:01 nbsp Hi there. A belated welcome to the wiki. Great new page on landscape architects. I added some language on it and left it open for other LAs to include their names or businesses. Then I created a new business page for your Great Valley Design, with a minimal amount of info that can be expanded upon. Users/robinlaughlin

20090915 14:34:50 nbsp Hi,
are you a landscape architect, or a landscape designer? Id like the page to be accurate and explain the distinction, then perhaps we can add folks like Margot Anderson and others.  Users/DonShor
