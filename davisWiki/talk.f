  Sounds like a ghost story to me.  Couldnt find anything on Google about this and it probably should be considered a hoax until proven otherwise. users/JimStewart
  I was thinking the same thing. Unfortunately, I no longer have access to the newspaper databases at the UCD library. Anyone want to check newsbank? Or the microfilm collections in the basement of shields? Edit: Checking out the http://registrar.ucdavis.edu/upload/GenCatArchive/GenCat19461947.pdf 19461947 general catalog, there is no Jonathan Williams listed as being a professor or staff in the College of Agriculture. Check out the listing starting on page 463. Edit 2: There is no Douglass St. in Davis and I cant find one on historical maps. There is, however, a Douglass Ave. Users/WilliamLewis

  Im going to delete this page in 24 hours if nobody comes forward with a supporting cite.  I know its probably just in fun, but we cant have Davis Wiki presenting stuff like this as factual if its just made up. users/JimStewart
  Can we put a disclaimer as opposed to deletion?  users/davishistorian
   Do you have any evidence whatever?   Users/CovertProfessor
   As somebody who has been writing fiction for the last couple months, this is great.  Its fun, its spooky... and it has nothing to do with documenting Davis, which is what this wiki is for.  Create a Shadows of Davis wiki and go for it, full of ghosts, werewolves and other creepy things.  Alternately, figure out a way to make it illustrative, cross linked and obviously fake, like the Zombie Survival Guide, and if you can do it well, Id personally support it here as a work of Davis based fiction (a la Davis based poetry, etc) rather than a misleading entry. ⁓Users/JabberWokky ʝ⍵
   I want to know what happened when the husband came home from the lab.  There wouldnt have been any past problem with his wife would there? Users/BruceHansen
   Create a page called Davis Ghost Stories, move it there, and delete this page.  That would work for me. Users/JimStewart
       Not a bad idea Jim, but Id disagree:  I dont like the idea of people uploading personal stuff on the wiki (fiction, poems, blogs, etc).  I like JWs idea of moving it off wiki. users/edwins ES
        Personally, I dont care where it goes as long as theres no confusion over whether its a work of fiction or not.  Personal stuff in the form of photos get uploaded all the time.  Im not quite sure why youd draw the line at written word.  Users/JimStewart
         One question with written fiction is whether other people can edit it.  If it creates an untouchable page, thats less appealing. Users/TomGarberson
          But, no toad sexing in davis it has been done. wl
            Which doesnt mean its appealing (and that text is still touchable, just less so than most). ⁓Users/JabberWokky ʝ⍵
         I like Jims solution. I dont see any problem with it. The main goal of the wiki is to compile anything and everything about Davis. Ghost stories are an individualistic type of folklore that, even though not collaborative in the wikis normal sense, still do not violate the basic mission of the website. I think we can make exceptions for rare occasions like this when stories or accounts reflect at least some realistic details of the town directly. Its only random fiction not centered around Davis life that would be bothersome to me. Users/ScottMeehleib
           I dig it.  As I said, I support it as a work of Davis based fiction.  It was the misleading aspect that was a problem for me. ⁓Users/JabberWokky ʝ⍵
