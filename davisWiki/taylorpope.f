20080525 15:22:20 nbsp  Welcome to the Wiki. Please read Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner; it will help explain how you can make the wiki a positive experience for you without clashing with established wiki social norms. If your business is local to Davis create a page for it rather than just adding your information to a page about another business. Users/JasonAller

20080719 22:23:09 nbsp I edited your wiki page to clean it up a bit, I also copied some comments from emove.com.  I hope you like the edit, if you dont just click on the info button at the top of the page and you can revert to the original version.   I recommend you post your rates and services on your wiki page here rather than make users go to emove.com to find them.  Also you can go to paypal.com and set up an account to accept credit card payments, you might find that better than using emove.com.  I also recommend a photo, maybe one of you and your workers smiling while moving a box, I always like to see a photo when I visit a wiki page.Users/DagonJones
