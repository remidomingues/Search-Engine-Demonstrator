tea list is a tea room, similar to a cafes café for tea. Their focus is on a selected list of high quality organic and fair trade teas that can be paired with their restaurants dining fare: sandwiches, salads and pastries.  They also sell their tea by the ounce. Tea List’s elegant and cozy tea room is also available for catered baby showers, bridal showers, birthday teas and any special smallscale event.

A bookstores bookstore called Casita del Cielo used to be in this location.

20090903 21:49:33 nbsp Added a PDF of the menu for your convenience! Users/laurele

20090906 17:02:48 nbsp A very pleasant place for an afternoon tea! The style is more small cafe rather than traditional tearoom, and is very small/cozy, with seating for maybe 12 inside, and another 68 outside on the patio. My turkey sandwich was comparable to some of the others available in town at the same price, with a nice pesto spread, and came with a very lovely mixedgreen salad. The berry tart was very good, with fruit that tasted so exceptionally fresh, I imagined that they had come from the Farmers Market just the day before. Id recommend it highly for a break from ones day, to sit and enjoy a cup of fine tea. Bring a couple of friends, or take that special someone on an afternoon date. Users/Flynn

20091009 09:57:25 nbsp Nice selection and very friendly. The owner is knowledgeable and made sure we knew what we were doing with a given tea, checked back to see if we needed anything, etc. Im a bit of a tea nut, so having a new place to sample is nice. (Mishkas tends to be too crowded and too warm for my taste.)

I just wish the hours ran later since the only time I can usually get there is the weekend with my work hours. :( Users/TracyPinkelton

20091022 21:16:50 nbsp Went there today for the first time.  The Tea List is a great addition to the Davis community and is situated in a quiet and cozy corner behind the mustard seed.  The owner is very knowledgeable and hospitable.  In addition to having the best selection of fine teas in Davis (you can even buy any of the loose teas to take home), they have handprepared breakfast, lunch, and dessert items as well.  I had the chicken salad sandwich (w/ grapes and walnuts) and it was fantastic!   Users/ibirdie

20091022 23:06:06 nbsp I had a lovely lunch out on the patio with some friends recently.  I am not a tea connoisseur, but one of my friends is, and she was delighted.  I enjoyed the choice of teas, too, and learned some things about tea that I didnt know before.  The sandwiches and desserts were fine (the veggie sandwich especially), though I dont think Id go there just for a meal.  I do plan on taking all my tealoving friends there, though, and I am dying to try the Tea Service some day (see the menu). Users/CovertProfessor

20091028 17:12:44 nbsp Ive had the good fortune to visit several times in the past month. The tea selection is superb. The list isnt exhaustive, but the selections seem to be chosen with an eye towards value and quality. Id single out the Persian tea for special praise. The salads are quite sizeable considering the quality of produce in them as well as the presentation. Also, the employees from the owner on down are professional, knowledgeable, and charming and take the effort to engage customers in conversation. Quite a pleasure. Users/ChrisV

20091111 17:24:51 nbsp This is a charming little place tucked behind the antique store next to the Mustard Seed.  The ladies working there were attentive and, well, also charming, especially the delightfully outfitted young lady. Its so nice to be served by someone who is not wearing jeans and a tshirt or hoodie. My friends loved their hot green chai, but as a coffee drinker (I know its a tea place) I was at first happy they served French pressed coffee, then quite disappointed with the taste and the amount.  I did let it sit four minutes and then plunged, but it either was not good coffee or had been prepared without enough coffee.  Also, it was served without a spoon or little plate (to rest the spoon), and it was only enough for one small cup of coffee.  I want to love this shop  its a great new place to meet friends  but please could you improve your coffee service for us coffee folks?  Another suggestion is to present a very small cookie or little treat with any drink as is the custom in Argentina  just a one bite simple something.  Ole! Users/BarbaraZ

20091129 14:50:28 nbsp Just went there today for the afternoon tea.  If I ran a tea room, Id run it like this (maybe with a koi pond outside). Loved it.   My full review at http://www.yelp.com/biz/tealistdavis#hrid:ZZsai3RX_7bo7WJCkg6ZbQ Users/atwong

20091228 20:05:49 nbsp amazing tea, lovely service and just overall nice ambience. the pomegranate cake was superb, goes quite nicely with some oolong tea. Users/elliotgoethe

20100408 09:32:41 nbsp Tea list is a lovely addition to Davis. A friend and I hosted a tea for 9 there last weekend and it was great. Its the owner, Nahid, who makes this place so special. If you are planning a special event, shes more than happy to work with you. And, shes a wonderful host to all customers. On the technical side, she knows her teas and the place has an extensive tea selection. Great location and ambiance, too.  Users/RMG

20100504 19:19:33 nbsp Had lunch today and it was really nice. Simple menu but good food. The atmosphere and ambiance was relaxing and quaint. It was nice to have cloth napkins at lunch and everything served with china and a special touch. Will definitely go again.  Users/HeatherMartin

20100702 02:07:59 nbsp Came here today for the first time with a friend of mine; the two of us stayed for a couple of hours (right at opening to about noon), and we had several teas.  All the teas were delicious, and the service was attentive and friendly.  The vegetarian sandwiches I got to try (one the standard Garden sandwich and the other a special with goat cheese and grilled vegetables), and the house salad were both delicious as well.  Overall, great place! :) Users/Michi

20100719 15:14:04 nbsp This place just gives me the warm fuzzies. I want to go here everyday! The owner and the younger woman who work here, not sure if theyre related but both of them are so beautiful and friendly I feel like Ive stepped into a little dream when I come in. The inside is perfect and cozy. I was concerned about the location when they moved in but can see that theyve developed a nice little following and are often packed when I walk past at lunchtime. mazeltov! Users/soledad101

20100807 17:10:36 nbsp Ive been here 6 or 8 times since I discovered it that many months ago  and will be back often. Nahid is one classy hostess, and gets every detail right. An afternoon at this little nook is an afternoon well spent. They even have teeny glutenfree cookies some afternoons! And their chai is the absolute best in the area  worth every penny. Users/calvin2

20100903 19:06:04 nbsp I dont get it, and maybe Im not cultured enough, but what is afternoon tea/high tea? And why is it 16 bucks? Users/TheShah
     No problem! Afternoon Tea is a multitiered tray with 12 small sandwiches (cucumber mint, turkey pesto, garden veggie, and chicken salad), scones, homemade pastries, fresh fruit, and a choice of tea! $15.95 is probably the cheapest price youll ever see for afternoon tea service anywhere, its a great deal considering the amount and quality of the food and drink. Theres a picture of the tray above. Hope that helps! Users/laurele
      Oh I see. That is a lot of food! How much tea comes with Afternoon Tea? Users/TheShah SS
       Typically the afternoon tea service is served in fancy china, and is brought out with a small teapot (about 2.5 cups) full of almost any of the teas on the menu (all loose leaf, most are organic and fair trade). They can all be steeped more than once if you need more than 2.5 cups of tea! Green and white teas are strong for at least two steepings, and oolongs are good for three or four. Black and herbal teas tend to be a little less strong the second time, but if you let them steep for a while longer theyre still pretty hardy.Users/laurele

20100910 12:21:33 nbsp A friend had brought back a tea blend from a trip to Europe for me to which, unfortunately, Id taken a desperate liking. Now Ive nearly run out, but after seeing tea list on the wiki I decided to see if they could help out. The staff there rose to the challenge, poring over and brewing the sample Id brought. In the end, they came up with a blend that is pretty darn close and quite good. I plan on enjoying the afternoon tea here at some point, but for now at least I know where Ill be getting my loose leaf from now on. Users/KevinChin

20100926 22:49:07 nbsp We went to Tea List for the afternoon tea service and it was absolutely wonderful! What a unique and excellent experience. So much attention was paid to every detailfrom the serving to the plates and silverware, to the food. The list of teas is really amazing, and when the food arrived, we really enjoyed every bitan overabundance of small sandwiches and excellent scones and pastries. This is a great deala very unique experience and a great way to celebrate or just spend a nice quiet afternoon.  Users/NicoleDocimo

20101005 12:54:31 nbsp My wife and I had afternoon tea service on Sunday.  Price was $16/person and included two teas, all the sandwiches we could eat, fruit, scones, and pastries.  It was all very lovely, the service was kind and attentive, the tea and food were excellent.  The location is very quaint and romantic.  A very nice place for a date or maybe a nice afternoon with your mother. Users/DagonJones

20101011 21:16:02 nbsp This place is awesome. Had afternoon tea with two friends from out of town (party of three overall) on Saturday, October 2. Good thing we made reservations a week in advance, because we happened to book on the same day that a party of 12 or so were having a birthday celebration indoors. So we got the outdoor seating, which turned out just right because though it rained briefly earlier that morning, by 2:30 PM, we had clear skies, a calm breeze and the early afternoon sunlight filtering through the trees  excellent ambiance.

My friends had never come here before, so they had first pick of the teas: our server recommended two large pots for three people, so we opted for the Oolong Organi Wuyi and the Peach Apricot Blend. Although I wasnt really a fan of the deep, bitter notes of the Wuyi, the Peach Apricot Blend (the first tea that I had enjoyed when I came here for the first time a few months ago) was just as good as ever: its creamy, fruitiness complemented our assorted selection of fruit, sandwiches and baked goodies. My friends and I spent about there hours there, lounging about, watching squirrels hop across the trees to the roof tops, sipping tea and nibbling on crumbling scones topped with strawberry jam and Devonshire cream.

My god, those scones! With the jam and Deveonshire cream? Yes!

We must have gone through four refills of both pots overall before we finally had to leave (because we had only paid for threehour parking).

As always, the staff and owner are always very kind and generous; they make you feel pampered and indulgent without being presumptuous or invading. The combination of service, delicious tea, delectable treats, and warm, cozy atmosphere make for an overall guilty pleasure. Its like they sincerely want you to have a good time  and thats always a good thing.

An experience here can be intimate, romantic and comforting, all at the same time  its a slice of heaven.

Were so coming back. Users/T.Zukumori

20110122 17:23:22 nbsp The small size of this place allowed for better service as well as nicer china and food than I have experienced at other tea houses. The owner is very nice, I think she is the one who served us. I ordered the Sencha green tea, which was pretty good but not as flavorful as Peets Sencha. I loved the scones, which tasted freshly baked and came with cream and strawberry jam. The tea sandwiches came in interesting flavors like cucumber mint, a chicken salad with bits of grape, and one with housemade pesto. The afternoon tea is actually pretty filling with all the little sandwiches they bring you. Another thing I appreciated was that she brought us a timer so we didnt oversteep our tea. She wasnt very helpful when I asked about the flavor of a few teas, and just kept talking about how oxidized they were, which makes it hard to venture out and try a new tea. Overall, a very relaxing experience, especially since the location is tucked away from street traffic. A great place for a date, special occasion or just something different. I will definitely be back to buy some tea leaves/bulk tea too. Users/Whit
 Maybe you misunderstood her answer, or she misunderstood your question? I know Nahid is very knowledgeable regarding all the teas in the shop, and has definitely tried them all many times (and similar teas from other companies! Sencha is intended to be a more subtle flavor, if you like stronger tea try the Chinese greens, or steep the Sencha longer! 3 minutes is just a suggestion). Of course, a lot of what anyone enjoys is personal preference! Users/laurele

20110126 13:22:42 nbsp I got a lovely cup of black lychee tea and a delicious veggie sandwich here. The cozy atmosphere and service were great, and their selection of leaves is truly impressive.  Users/AsmaMaryamMohseni

20110215 21:42:14 nbsp I tried tea list for the first time last week. A friend and I shared the afternoon tea service and a cheese plate. The owner, Nahid, provided a small pot of her housemade Persian tea blend, in addition to the pot of tea Id ordered. Since then, Ive been back twice, and I plan to continue supporting her business. I recommend the afternoon tea service for your first visit. It provides a sample of many of the menu items, and its how I discovered my new favorite sandwich: the garden veggie. The customer service has been wonderful each time. Users/MGBriggs

Unless this is some mob related money laundering scheme, I cannot see this business surviving. Its a creative idea and I wish every small owner the best of luck...but wow...tea??? good luck with that... Users/JoshLawson
 Even people that wont touch a cup of tea cant help but fall in love with the fresh food, homemade pastries, freshcut flowers, and relaxing ambiance at Tea List. Stepping in feels like stepping into a little cafe in France or Switzerland, and that seems to keep people coming back. Davis has supported a number of highquality restaurants, pastry shops, and coffee shops (Konditorei, Village Bakery, and Ciocolat to name a few) for as long as I can remember, but Tea List has its own niche. Tea is gaining popularity in the United States right now, but has incredibly varied historical and cultural significance. Plus its good for you! Why not tea? Users/laurele

20110415 22:03:59 nbsp mmmmmmmmmm.  had the pleasure to visit tea list for the first time today and it was wonderful!  although it took a little time for our afternoon tea service to actually begin, it was understandable due to the amount of people that was there.  the matcha latte is excellent, very flavorful and i wish i could afford to have one every day! the pastries are delicious, as well as the sandwiches.   also, i really appreciate the owners care and hospitality.  She made nice conversation and seemed to show a lot of genuine love for her business.  definitely plan on coming by again.  :)  thanks for the great afternoon. Users/greensea

20110423 11:58:57 nbsp This is a great place for tea, hidden away from the hustleandbustle of the street front, but yet right in the heart of downtown. Interesting tea selection, great housemade pastries, great personal service (just cant be in a rush here, as a bit slow). My complaint is that the inside is a bit cramped and can be loud when full, which doesnt match with a relaxing afternoon tea, but the outside seating is lovely. The high tea is pricey, but worth it for what you get and a great splurge. Some of the tea sandwiches are a bit dry for me, and the size of the Devonshire cream that comes with the scones is far too small, but overall I like this place and will be back. Users/BrentKago

20110507 23:13:10 nbsp Went here today for the first time... At first, I was a bit hesitant to spend 5 bucks on a cup of tea, but dont worry, its definitely worth it. The service was great, and the atmosphere left nothing to be desired. I plan on going back and trying as many different teas as possible. Dont pass this one up. Users/ZacMillersmith

20110622 22:55:01 nbsp I love Tealist. The owner, Nahid is so kind and caring. My friend and I usually try to go once a month and she always remembers our names. This is place isnt in the most prominant location (it is somewhat hidden), but those who are in the know about Tealist love it. I went there again today at lunchtime and the owner knew many of the people seated at the other tables; her regulars. They have a huge selection of teas. I am a green tea fan, but their Persian tea is the most popular (which is fitting, as the owner is Persian). They have Mate (a South American herbal drink). Their teas are steeped and you use an hour glass to determine when the tea is ready to drink.

My friend and I always get the cheese plate, which comes with 4 cheese slices (white cheddar, brie, gouda, and manchego I think) which comes with bread (unlimited refills on bread), crasins, and cucumbers. They have amazing fresh fruit. Their scones are alright, but the jam is amazing. For the same reason I really love their Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwhiches (so good even tho you can laugh b/c it is PB&J but good PB&J at that). Their flowers are always fresh and I think from farmers market. I would highly recomend this place.

Also, this is a place for serious tea drinkers at home. You can get bags of loose leaf tea (rather than in preset tea bags). They will scoop tea by the ounce (more or less depending on how much), place it into a little brown bag and then you put the tea into a holder at home. Users/BryceH

20110717 16:10:58 nbsp Absolutely the best tea in town (and beyond)!  Gorgeous atmosphere, phenomenal service, and great food.  While you will pay more for a cup of tea than at other shops, the quality more than compensates for any price difference.  If you enjoy tea, dessert, or simply a relaxed atmosphere, do yourself a favor and try this place. Users/cfb

20110807 16:57:34 nbsp Tea List has quickly become our source for good loose leaf tea, and my wife and I enjoy their afternoon tea.  Weve sorely missed Earl Grey Manor in Old Sac since they went out of business a few years ago, and are glad to have another local tea room even closer to home. Users/BrianWilliams

20120327 17:16:53 nbsp Caught up with a friend over some strawberry green tea and pastries here today. The owner was really nice, and even gave us samples of a delicious Persian black tea. Will definitely be back! Users/Ziwei.Hu

20120402 00:19:55 nbsp Ive been to this wonderful little place twice. Once with my mother, and again with her and my husband. Ive loved every moment of both visits. Afternoon tea here is one of the most relaxing meals Ive ever enjoyed. The setting is charming, the service perfectly friendly, and the teas (an enormous selection) and food (as much as you can eat) delicious. But today was even better. We decided to give a tea party for my mothers 70th birthday (and my sons 23rd) at our house. The ladies at tea list prepared enough for ten, helped suggest teas, presented it on the usual tiered plates, and helped me get it to the car, all on probably their busiest day of the year so far judging from the crowd they had, and they did it sweetly and efficiently. My mother, my son, and all of our guests agreed that it was a huge success. I cant recommend this place highly enough. From now on this is my number one recommended restaurant in town. Users/Davidlm

20120723 12:37:04 nbsp Yep its been a while since Ive commented on the place, but Ive continued to visit it regularly. They still pour an excellent cuppa tea and the food offerings are wonderful too. Highly recommended. Users/ChrisV

20121211 13:29:34 nbsp The desserts are really good and the tea selection is amazing.

My partner got the turkey sandwich and I got the chicken salad sandwich. Both were served with a side salad with what I think was a balsamic vinegartype dressing. The turkey sandwich had a really good pesto on it, and the chicken salad sandwich had grapes in it. It was very good, but still seemed like an afterthought to the tea which is understandable as this is the tea list, not the sandwich list. We had the bourbon street vanilla rooibos tea and it was really tasty! We also had the lemon mousse, which, as my partner said, made him feel like he ate a lemon cloud.

The service was good and the atmosphere was very sweet. Close, small, charming and quaint. It was a really romantic spot. Users/HannahToru

20121211 14:57:37 nbsp The chicken salad sandwich (on sesame focaccia) is my favorite sandwich in town.  The vegetable sandwich is a solid alternative too.  I keep bringing company here.  Two thumbs up! Users/JudithTruman

20130316 20:40:01 nbsp One of my favorite places in Davis! The Tea List is located in a peaceful alley, with a charming outside area. The interior is small but cozy and bright  each table has fresh flowers. Their tea selection is varied and everyone will find a tea that theyll love. I love the simple and elegant pastries, like the tiramisu in a teacup or the pastel colored fondants. The owner, Nahid, is a most charming and graceful host.  Users/SophiaBrattain

20130702 12:59:53 nbsp I love this place!  My husband and I enjoyed the high tea service today for lunch.  The service was excellent and the food and tea were delicious.  Ive been looking for a new lunch spot and I believe Ive found it.   Users/Trena

20131107 17:48:09 nbsp My three year old daughter and her grandmother came here for tea and absolutely loved it. Plus there are plenty of leftovers for us to eat at home, the food is delicious. Ive also had lunch here and the food is fantastic. I recommend the garden veggie sandwich and the service is wonderful quiet place to enjoy a lovely meal. Users/Zeeba
