20081022 10:30:33 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy Ms. 218 and Welcome to the Wiki!   You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you (or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here).  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for the review of MT Nails... it would be great if you edited the entry itself so it had a description of what they are like (rather than just a price list).  You can hit the Edit icon on just about any entry and change anything on the wiki.  Anyway, once again, welcome to the wiki! Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
