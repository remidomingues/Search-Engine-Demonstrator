20120323 13:23:22 nbsp Welcome to the wiki!  I wanted to let you know that I undid some of the edits that you made to The Bike People page  reading Welcome to the wiki/Business Owner this page should help you to understand why.  In particular, the wiki tends to keep comments, both negative and positive, as well as links to related pages, in order to make the wiki as useful as possible to the Davis community.  Rather than deleting, you are encouraged to respond to comments in order to present your side of things.

On another note, organizational user names that seem to limit a person to editing to the business page, and which confer an air of authority, are generally not seen as acceptable.  Please close this account yourself by clicking settings in the upper right hand corner, change your email address from username@host to username+disabled@host and then press Save. Then scroll down to the bottom and use the Disable Forever option. That will allow you to use the same email address to signup again under a different name.

Sorry  that probably seems like a lot of rules.  But I hope you stick around to see all that the wiki can offer and to edit some other pages. Users/CovertProfessor
