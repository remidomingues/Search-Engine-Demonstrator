A wandering minstrel of the night playing the blues where ever he goes.   Rumored to be obsessed with cheese wheels....

Welcome to the Wiki Howdy, Rev. Blue, and Welcome to the Wiki!   You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you (or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here).  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  I moved the contents of the entry you created to this one (your personal entry), as the public entries are generally things that have to do with Davis in general and that everybody edits.  This is more the entry about you.  No worries... were all tradition here, not hard and fast rules, so its no biggie.  You seem cool... tell us more about yourself!
