Howdy, Mr. or Ms. Jib  welcome to the wiki!  You might want to add to the Kensington Apartments entry rather than remove from it.  It tends to work better.  Right now a variety of different people are protecting the opinions on that page.  If you add your opinion, respecting the others on there (and yes, you can call their review wrong... thats different than calling somebody stupid), everybody will protect your opinion with the same determination.  People are restoring it to keep information, not to make Kensington Apartments look bad... its just that nobody has yet spoken up to sing the praises of the place.
