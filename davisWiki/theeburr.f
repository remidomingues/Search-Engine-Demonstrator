20110831 13:56:15 nbsp Just so you know, if the landlord hasnt refunded the full amount of the security deposit within 21 days, youre legally entitled to a refund of the full amount of the deposit.  Specifically, California Civil Code http://law.onecle.com/california/civil/1950.5.html section 1950.5(g)(1) requires a refund within 21 days, and the 1995 California Supreme Court case http://scocal.stanford.edu/opinion/granberryvislayinvestments31631 Granberry v. Islay Investments says, If, within the specified period, the landlord has not provided the tenant with a written accounting of the portion of the security deposit he plans to retain, the right to retain all or part of the security deposit under section 1950.5, subdivision (f), has not been perfected, and he must return the entire deposit to the tenant.  The subdivision (f) its talking about has since been renumbered to the present subdivision (g). Users/TomGarberson
