Please halt the conspiracy!
I am a Spanish Teacher in the area; I have lived in Davis for more than 18 years.
Everyone in the area is aware that I have been persecuted by the local town
leaders, police, & previous d.a., including held hostage in the Yolo jail for 2 years
when everyone knew I was innocent, yet no one did anything about it.  This town
has betrayed me; Im asking citizens to do the right thing & halt the conspiracy.
When local leaders become corrupt, it is up to the individual citizens to ensure justice,
but this failed to occur.  It has been made clear to me that the false accusation &
2 year captivity, with the leaders pressuring everyone to keep silent, was a test run;
if they can get away with it, next theyll go for the death penalty.  A wise man scales
the city walls destroys the foundation of the city, Prov. 21:22.  Please call President Obama,
2024561414 & demand the corrupt officials be arrested; call Congressman Mike
Thompson, 2022253311; Chief Asst. Attorney General Dane Gillette, 4157035866;
call agents Kappelhoff & Callahan at US Dept. of Justice, 2025143204; demand
the conspirators be arrested!!!  See http://angelfire.com/mac/resurrection/freespeech.html
for more facts.

Follow Jesus!
I evangelize in town, sharing the Good News (gospel) of Jesus Christ, that if you confess
with your mouth Jesus is Lord, & believe with your heart God raised him from the dead,
you shall be saved! Rom 10:9.  Call me with questions about God, to debate, spiritual
issues, or to fellowship.  See angelfire.com/mac/resurrection for a paper that I wrote
proving the resurrection of Jesus from the dead, Jesus Christ & the Trustworthiness of
the Bible, a masterpiece according to the late Rev. Harvey Klapstein, National Director
of Senior Ministries, O.B Standard Churches.
