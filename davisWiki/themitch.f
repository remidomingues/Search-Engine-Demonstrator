This editor can edit this entry and tell us a bit about themselves by clicking the Edit icon. Or the content from Laura Mitchell could be move here?


20100128 19:49:48 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. What a wonderful set of edits you made. I did ask a question on the http://daviswiki.org/Volunteer_Program/Talk?actionrecall&version4 Volunteer Program/Talk page that maybe you can answer. I notice you created both a public figure page Laura Mitchell and a redirect from The Mitch to that page, but hadnt created your userpage (this page); did you have a plan about that?

20100129 22:01:00 nbsp Hey, I have a whole bunch of questions about the Queer Leadership Retreat entry.  As its written, I cant quite tell what it is and who runs and participates in it.  Is it for UCD, a high school, teachers, or what?  Is it a public event?  All those kinds of things are assumed to be known, but arent actually written in the entry, so I (as a reader) honestly have no idea what the event actually is.  Sounds neat, though.
