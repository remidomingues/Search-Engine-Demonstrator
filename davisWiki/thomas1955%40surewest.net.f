This account has been a sockpuppet for someone associated with Abba Salon and Spa, perhaps Users/Davis25.

20100723 10:17:47 nbsp Hello. I can attest to this account, since I am the account owner, and I will explain everything and I hope this will make sense. First of all, to establish my identity, my name is Michael, and you can guess what my last name is (hint: it is in my login name).

What happened is this: I helped out with Soon to establish her website at her salon a few months ago, and I accidentally forgot to log out. Soon, not knowing she has been editing with my name, kept using my login account to do editing on abba salon page. It was an honest mistake, and I personally would like to apologize for that. It is my mistake in forgetting to log out from Soons laptop that causes all this edit war, as well as Soon being alleged to been doing sockpuppetry.

This is a simple honest mistake, and I assure you that I will help Soon establish her own account for Abba salon, and be more careful with my account credentials in daviswiki.

If anyone has any questions regarding my veracity or my authenticity as a real person living in Davis, you can ask t.zukumori to verify my existence in real life.

I am a proud member of the Davis community since 1998, and would like to say that I will try and trying to help out any way I can.

Thank you and sincerely,
