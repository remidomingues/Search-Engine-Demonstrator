Hi Tiffany, welcome to the wiki! I understand your reluctance to leave lessthanstellar reviews under your name while you are still living at an apartment complex; however, http://daviswiki.org/Westwood_Townhouse_Apartments?actiondiff&version258&version157 your edit made it seem as though the comment had been left by someone else completely, not just anonymously (there is already someone who uses the name Users/gradstudent). It would be better to avoid leaving comments unless you are happy to have your name stand behind your point of view  perhaps after you move out of this apartment youll be comfortable leaving a review that might help others out.

Again, welcome to the wiki, and I hope you keep editing! :)  Users/ElleWeber

20090728 11:36:34 nbsp Welcome! In the interest of full disclosure, I feel I need to tell you that someone can always look at the edit history of the page and see that it was you that wrote the comment. Its right at the top of the page, through the button marked info. That isnt to say that everyone will be aware who actually wrote the note, only that someone who is curious enough, and familiar with the wiki, can find out pretty quickly. Users/JoePomidor
