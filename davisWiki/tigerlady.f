20080821 16:06:19 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy, Mr. or Ms. Lady, and Welcome to the Wiki!   You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you (or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here).  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for adding the window tinting entry, but this wiki is about Davis, and Users/JoePomidor a fellow editor removed it for that reason.  You might want to add it to the wiki:sacramento Sacramento Wiki, which is where people looking for tinting in the Sacramento area would be looking anyway.  Your wiki login here will work fine there as well.   Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
