We are geographers and we intend to share and experience the world, come with us...
This page is for taking note of all those logistics involved with group travel, dont forget the links.

For the casual observer below you will find a sampling of the kinds of conferences and topics Geographers work on contained within the titles of presentations people give at conferences. In particular what Geographers in Davis do. Most belong to the Geography Graduate Group but some some International Agricultural Development, Transportation Technology and Policy,Community and Regional Development and other related fields of study.

Whos Going

Social
Sunday morning breakfast in Solvang at http://www.yelp.com/biz/paulaspancakehousesolvang Paulas Pancake House, 9am
UCD Alumni welcome

  http://www.yelp.com/biz/belgiancafethesolvang The Belgian Cafe seems to get good reviews, but may not be real Danish food according to some sites.
  http://www.yelp.com/biz/paulaspancakehousesolvang Paulas Pancake House appears to serve more Danish food and also has some decent reviews.
  A http://www.royalcopenhageninn.com/SolvangDining.html comprehensive list or at least appears so of all dining options.
  Users/BrentLaabs has had good experiences with The Little Mermaid, or Mortensens for pastries.

Transportation
  Carpooling is about the only feasible way to get there.
   Enterprise Rental Car from Davis FriMon at 1/2 price weekend special was $80+gas and tax (Standard or Full Size)
  Train might be an option but would take a long time.
  Flying into Santa Barbara is possible but expensive.  LAX or Burbank are other options, but youll have to drive about 2 hours north (if you manage to not hit traffic).

Lodging
The Solvang/Santa Ynez is a bit of a travel hotspot so its not super cheap.
