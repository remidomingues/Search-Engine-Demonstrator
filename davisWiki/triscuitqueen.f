You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you (or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here).  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Wow, youre sure full of vinegar for some of your fellow neighbors!

The comment macro just makes it easy, since it automatically signs and dates your comment. You can edit pretty much everything on the wiki, just like all your fellow editors.
