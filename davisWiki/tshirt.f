Shirts


Round 3
(Jan 2011)
Ambers butterfly design looks fantastic on the dark green of this years tshirts. Email Bryan at bjpon (at) ucdavis.edu if youre interested in ordering a shirt.

Round 2
(Nov 2008)
We stuck with the same design for group imaging reasons and to keep our cost down. As of Jan 2009 there are several shirts available for purchase.
They are $15, made from Organic Cotton(Anvil), in M,L,XL. Contact Users/AlexMandel if you would like to purchase one.
Proceeds from the sale go to the clubs funds.

Round 1
(March 2008)
We made a first round of shirts in time for the GLOBAL/travel AAG 2008. Do to the time crunch we had to go with a simpler design. All of the first round have been sold to members.

Ultimate Discs
We dont want our designs to go to waste so Users/AlexMandel would like to see Elenas map design become an ultimate disc design.
  We need to finish the design  Based on Elenas design were looking at using a polar projection for the disc.
  We need to raise funds from tshirt sales to pay for the first round of discs.
  We need to agree that we want to make some discs.
Once all those tasks are done Users/AlexMandel has the information to order from DiscCraft.

20100221 00:48:44 nbsp Hi,

The butterfly/globe sketch is in its early stages. Im hoping to get some feedback. I was thinking along the lines of if a butterfly flaps its wings in China... and the general biogeographic ties to butterflies (not least because Art Shapiro is on our campus). If people like the idea, Id flesh it out by filling oceans with black, cleaning up the lines (keeping lat/long lines as allusion to butterfly wing veins) and maybe putting it in a circle.  CA dogface butterflies are yellow, so this could be a blackonyellow or yellowondarkcolor shirt. If we want different colors, I could use a different butterfly profile. I was picturing the image relatively small (<4), off center, and tilted. The words GLOBAL stands for could be a squiggly butterfly trail, or could be on the back of the shirt.

Other shirt ideas are:
A stylized map of Davis
A modification of the Mother Earth graphic above (original is by W. Heath Robinson, done between 1897 and 1944)
Your own bright ideas? Users/admanfree
