20101210 07:42:01 nbsp When I read something from you on Hanlees Toyota/Scion and Triple A Automotive, I had the impression that you were a female, but someone else thought that you were a male?  You seemed to think that Triple A is all good and Hanlees all bad.  I dont think that is realistic, even in the abstract. I have personally dealt with both of these companies.   very good experience with Triple A, but I found them to be subject to human error, including that theyre not 100% firsttimefixit crack mechanics. With Hanlees I found a willingness to help and a satisfaction in helping.  In life in general, ones good intentions dont necessarily bring competence, but I would say that they are very valuable.  Hanlees is a very established business and I doubt that they set out to be jerks as you seemed to state.  Youre entitled to your opinion, but you should express your opinion in a way that doesnt hijack the whole page. Users/BruceHansen
