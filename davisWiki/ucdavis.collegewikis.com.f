As a subset of collegewikis.com, ucdavis.collegewikis.com is a wiki oriented to UC Davis students. Following in the footsteps of UDavisLife.com, they introduced themselves to the UCDavis community through a spam campaign on December 8th, 2007 and again on January 17, 2008 and on February 8, 2008. According to their pitch videos website ({{{http://www.vator.tv/pitch/show/collegewikis}}}), collegewikis.com is based out of Stanford, and their site indicates that they obtain revenue from googles adsense program. Youll need a legit ucdavis email address to read their site even the privacy policy does not appear publicly available. It is unclear what user habits they collect, but their pitch page indicates that they at least track how often you log onto the site.
