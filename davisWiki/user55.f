Describe Users/user55 here.

I had thought that this person, who is clearly a sockpuppet for Users/RealComputers, had been unbanned.   Users/CovertProfessor
   He was unbanned over a month ago.  I have no idea why hes using this account (other than the obvious: missing when his name was taken off the banned user list and his editor entry restored and never using his account so he saw the Edit button was back).  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

I didnt even know there was a list for that. Brian

I did not know that I was unbanned. I just asumed I wasnt.  Brian
  Interesting that you created a sockpuppet even when you thought you were banned, rather than, say, contacting JW via email or some such if you thought your request was urgent.   Users/CovertProfessor
I actually called JW over the phone twice and left him a messageFootnote(As a minor footnote, Brian called both times during a business call... I thought he was a friend who lives in Citrus Heights named Brian and I just made a note to call him back tonight.  My error (and I shouldnt keep two entires with the same first name, especially as I know both their last names).  jw). He did not call me back so I asumed I was still banned. I dont want to have issues this time around so please lets not start off making assumptions. _ Brian
  You started off with bad behavior.  There are no assumptions involved.  cp
  Whatever CP, I just wanted to try and help that lady get her emails back.
   She was a customer  dont you have her phone number?  Email address?  cp
    Unfortunately I dont, otherwise I would have called her.
     Ok, if you say so.  But you might want to rethink your business practices.  Being able to contact clients and former clients is A Good Thing.  cp
      I agree. I regret that I did not have her number in this case. Brian
http://www.woodlandwiki.org/Users/user55?actionuserinfo care to correct this? Users/JasonAller
 Maybe this isnt obvious yet but I guess I am think headed. Posting a link and saying care to fix this does not mean anything to me. can you be more specific?
... I think I fixed what u were referring to but I have no idea. Brian


Respons to footnote  Its all good man, I was just confused anyway.
