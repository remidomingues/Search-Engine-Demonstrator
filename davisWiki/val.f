20091119 08:57:49 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. Are you the author of Bounty and Savings? I ask because someone commented about http://daviswiki.org/Target?actiondiff&version2144&version1143 your edit to the Target page. Balancing out your edits with contributions to the wiki would make it less likely for someone to interpret your edits as just an attempt to drive traffic from the noncommercial wiki to a commercial blog.

20091120 14:38:58 nbsp Hi Jason, thanks for the comment! Yes Im the author of Bounty and Savings, as someone mentioned on the Target page, Davis doesnt have a critical mass for people utilizing coupons, and its a pity, if you look at the amount of money one could save with coupons and sales. N California is among the lowest coupon redemption area in the county and Im hoping to change that :) No my blog is not a commercial blog  I have affiliates and ads to cover the hours I spend everyday to provide people with deals, hope you understand! I should make more comments on other wiki pages :)  Users/val
