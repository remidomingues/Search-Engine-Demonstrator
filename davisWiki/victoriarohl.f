20081211 08:57:08 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy Victoria, and Welcome to the Wiki!    My names Evan, pleased to meet you.  You dont need to worry about editing your own comments, so no need for the plea please allow change.  The only reason your last edit was partially reverted is because you removed the reviews of other people.  In general, reviews  both positive and negative  are retained.  You might want to read Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner the informal, community written guide for business owners for some tips others have contributed.  Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards

20081211 06:31:33 nbsp Thank you, Evan. I am new to all of this, so I appreciate the guidance. As long as I have your ear (or screen, as the case may be) I have a question about DavisWiki. I am the owner of Cartridge World Davis, but I did not make Cartridge Worlds listing on DavisWiki. My feeling is that if I chose to list my business on DavisWiki, then I am accepting that postings will be made about my business, negative or positive. If a business owner doesnt put their business out there, it seems that a page should be taken down at the owners request. I am new to this Wiki World, but it seems obvious that negative comments can be posted by any Tom, Dick or Harry without a business even deserving it. I understand that we can retaliate in kind, but the original comment is already out there. In this difficult economy, businesses are having a hard enough time making it. This other stuff seems to make it a hostile business climate...I thought I was avoiding that by choosing to open my business in the lovely town of Davis rather than Sacramento. Finally, the question...can I just have my Cartridge World page removed all together? Users/victoriarohl
   Well, its not mine to remove.  Its a creation of the community.  Its a bit like a newspaper article, only there are multiple contributors, all listed in the Info tab, and unlike newspaper article, everybody (including the owner and supporters) have an ability to respond.  Cartridge World is part of the community of Davis, so somebody wrote an entry here on the wiki about it (just like somebody wrote an entry about the Mayor, and another person wrote one about their church, and another person wrote up an entry about their kids softball team).  One key thing that might help is understanding that the wiki is not a business listing site  old businesses that closed a decade ago are written up in the same way as new ones (since they are part of the history of Davis), and there are entries about old murals, bike races and town events like local elections.  The Davis Wiki is a collection of things about Davis itself, and since Cartridge World is part of Davis, it has an entry that somebody in the community wrote and others added to.  That said, you are welcome to contribute: the wiki is open to the entire community of Davis, and that includes you.  The reason the negative reviews were restored was to give the same respect to those editors.  If they deleted your reply somebody would restore your words.  Once again, I encourage you to read Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner the community written tips for business owners.  And of course, if you have any questions, there are a bunch of people who can help you  the entire wiki was created by volunteers all working together, and were pretty supportive of each other, especially new editors like you.
