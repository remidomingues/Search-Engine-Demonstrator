20090215 16:14:26 nbsp  Welcome to the Wiki. How about leaving some positive comments, the ones youve left http://daviswiki.org/Users/vlam?actionuserinfo so far might benefit from some balance. Tell the rest of us a little about yourself; make a place for yourself here in this Wiki Community community. Users/JasonAller

20090215 18:55:58 nbsp Youve made your point, he has replied. Your comments are full of personal attacks that are not necessary, and as far as anyone can tell you have never even been to the shop. I will continue to revert the page until you either modify your comments or drop the subject.  Users/DonShor

20090217 08:36:35 nbsp Don you’re so lame, is this guy one of your shady relative or what? Why are you so defensive? There are dozens of folks on this lame wiki that does not have a page and there so called positive comments consider valid. I planned on taking my car to Aggie for smog in a couple of days after reading the positive comments. Unfortunately, bayer044 burst the bubble. I felt like I’ve been cheated mentally. Do you understand that? I ended up taking my car to Advanced Auto and have it tested there and it’s a lot cheaper. Comments, I posted there are facts no drama, no personal attacks, no motives. Whats your motives? Users/vlam

20090217 11:09:52 nbsp I am no relation to the owner and barely know him. I dont like to see unfounded personal attacks on local businesses. My positive review is based on my experience there. My smog check there cost $65, was handled promptly and professionally. Im sure Advanced Auto probably does fine as well. Your comments were not based on your personal experience. You called him a crook, a liar, and a shameless businessman. Those arent personal attacks? Tone down your rhetoric and Ill leave your comments alone.
BTW, are http://daviswiki.org/Users/vlam?actionuserinfo you also http://daviswiki.org/Users/srednivashtar?actionuserinfo srednivashtar?

20090327 16:47:19 nbsp Ok, heres how it works on Davis Wiki.
You have posted your opinion based only on someone elses post. To a degree that is acceptable, until you start to make generalizations regarding the practices of the business owner.  Many people have bad experiences with good people/businesses all the time.  This does not mean that anyone is at really in the wrong.
If you take a look, your initial comment has remained untouched.
I recommend that you try something before you start slamming it.
As you have admitted to never having had dealings with this business, nor its owner, there is no way for you to know if your allegations are true. Users/MasonMurray

20100306 10:20:19 nbsp Vlam, you have written posts describing a person as a liar and a crook.  Ad hominem attacks are inappropriate.  You can edit these posts to eliminate the attacks or I will delete them.  The choice is yours.  I have no relationship with you, the person or anyone else concerned.   Users/JimStewart
