Welcome to the Wiki Howdy, Mr. or Ms. Voyager, and Welcome to the Wiki!   You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you (or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here).  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!  Thanks for adding a review of Ground Zero Boardshop... if you know more about snow sports in the area, it would be great if you could add to snow sports that entry!
