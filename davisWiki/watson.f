Im a graduate student in Applied Mathematics (specialty in Neuroscience)...

I moved to Davis in 2007 from San Francisco. I live in East Davis (near Pole Line Rd. / Loyola Dr.)

Outside of school I like to:
  take care of myself (meditation, yoga)
  write software which creates ambitious music
  explore lands far far away (Indonesia, Africa, Europe...)

My favorite places in Davis (so far):
  Delta of Venus
  Davis Cemetery
  The tether ball court array at the Korematsu School next to Mace Ranch Park
  The Arboretum; especially the sparsely trafficked fields and oaks on the western side
  The part of the bike loop in southeast Davis.
