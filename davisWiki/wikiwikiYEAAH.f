Describe Users/wikiwikiYEAAH here.


wikiwikiYEAAH is a sockpuppet account that used the same IP address as Users/foodexpert and Users/C.H.Kuo to comment on The Old Teahouse.

According to wikiwikiYEAAHs comment on OTH, C.H.Kuo is their friend hence the shared IPs, but considering the record of Users/ilikebeer several Users/abcdefghilikefood other sockpuppets by this IP address, that story is rather doubtful.



20080520 16:42:01 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki. Please consider the importance of using your RealName. Leaving comments under different names to make it appear as though your opinion is shared by many people is called Sockpuppeting and is considered to be in poor taste. Additionally, this is the 5th account to use your IP address, and because of the sockpuppeting your potentially legitimate concerns are not being listened to. If there are issues with these restaurants, my best advice to you would be to create a single account under your real name and use that from now on. Users/MaxMikalonis
