The wiki is a project of a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that is unable to engage in the promotion of commercial enterprise. However, a few photographs dont rise to the level of promotion and anything thats too advertisey can be rewritten. It really isnt the end of the world.

On another note, nice photos. ) Im another gElectrical and computer engineering EEk with a camera. Users/WilliamLewis

20100505 22:22:02 nbsp Thanks for the info William, whats your gear? I am always looking for fellow photographers in the area for gear testing, and helping each other out! Users/williamliuphotography

20100505 22:48:54 nbsp Ive got a D90, a Nikkor 18105, Nikkor 50 mm f/1.8, and a generic light aluminum ballhead tripod. Nothing to really write home about... maybe once I start making more money. Users/WilliamLewis

20100506 18:29:52 nbsp I am not that familiar with Nikons, but the D90 seems like a nice camera to me, similar to the Canon 50D? I dont have much of a bias either way, I just happened to end up with Canons. Well, feel free to chat with me about anything (photography related or not) if you feel like it! ) Users/williamliuphotography
