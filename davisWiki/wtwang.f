20100119 04:30:37 nbsp Welcome to the Wiki Howdy Lisa, and Welcome to the Wiki!   You might want to check out the importance of using your RealName, just so we can get to know you.  Or not: its your choice, but people were pretty friendly here.  Or maybe wtwang is your real name, and you just go by Lisa?  Hey, I have an odd nickname myself... and were easy about those things here... its just confusing when people are trying to figure out what name to say hi with, especially when youre new. ;)  My names Evan, pleased to meet you!   I noticed that another editor removed your notes about looking to sublease an apartment... its not really appropriate on Student Review Board, for example.  The entry youre probably looking for is Roommates Wanted, where you can add a notice, plus it might help to read roommate guide (which covers some general points, but also lists resources where you might post your sublease).  If you have any questions, just ask... were friendly here on the wiki, and people enjoy helping each other out.  Once again, welcome to the wiki! Users/JabberWokky Evan JabberWokky Edwards
