20080314 23:33:05 nbsp Edits like http://daviswiki.org/Jusco?actiondiff&version289&version188 this and http://daviswiki.org/Jusco?actiondiff&version286&version185 this dont fit with Wiki ethics. Id suggest taking some time to edit some other pages before coming back to the Jusco page. Users/JasonAller

20081107 16:46:43 nbsp Care to join the discussion on Campaign Contributions? Id also be interested to know why you picked the two businesses you did out of the whole list from town who donated money in favor of November 2008 Presidential Election/Proposition 8 Prop 8. I did a search using the advanced search and browsed all contributions from Davis to all campaigns from June to the election. There were some interesting patterns and a lot of names that I recognized. On a Federal level Davis donates more than the average level, so that was interesting to look at again as well.

20081210 00:03:32 nbsp Hi, I was wondering if you know about a list of local businesses/shops in Davis that supported Prop 8. I cant seem to find anything on DavisWiki. I find merely found the names of people, but not the businesses they own in davis. Users/ThanhVu
