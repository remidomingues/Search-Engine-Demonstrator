20120521 17:57:33 nbsp Belated welcome to the wiki! I restored some of the pictures to Rajas Tandoor because the wiki keeps history, especially when editors have gone to the trouble to take photos and upload them.  Its nice to see what a place used to look like.

However, without getting too personal, I would understand if the picture of Harmeet and Taranbir needs to be deleted? Users/CovertProfessor
