20091125 17:43:34 nbsp Hi, Ms/Mr Zaryna, and a belated Welcome to the Wiki/Business Owner welcome to the Wiki! I notice that youve posted several Rominger West Winery events on the community Events Board. Almost all of the accompanying pictures are quite large. Could you please reduce their size before you upload them? You may also want to check some feedback posted on the Rominger page. I hope to make it out to the winery before years end. Cheers.
